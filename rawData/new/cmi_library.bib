    abstract = "In early blindness, the primary visual area (PVA) loses the ability to process visual information, and shifts to working on the processing of somatosensory input, auditory input, and some higher-level cognitive functions. It has not yet been investigated whether such functional changes can lead to alterations of the functional connectivity between the PVA and other brain areas in resting state. The purpose of this study is to investigate the differences in the functional connectivity of the PVA between early blind and sighted subjects using resting functional MRI data. The altered functional connectivity was identified by comparing the correlation coefficients of the PVA with other brain areas between 16 early blind subjects (blindness onset within 1 year of age) and 32 gender- and age-matched healthy sighted volunteers. Compared with the sighted, the early blind subjects showed decreased functional connectivity between the left PVA and the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), pre- and postcentral gyri, superior parietal lobule, and the left superior and middle temporal gyri. Early blind subjects also showed decreased functional connectivity between the right PVA and the bilateral SMA, pre- and postcentral gyri. Our findings suggest that early deprivation of a single sensory modality induces alterations of functional connectivity between the deprived functional area and other associated brain areas.",

    abstract = "Analysis of task-evoked fMRI data ignores low frequency fluctuations (LFF) of the resting-state the BOLD signal, yet LFF of the spontaneous BOLD signal is crucial for analysis of resting-state connectivity maps. We characterized the LFF of resting-state BOLD signal at 11.7T in $\alpha$-chloralose and domitor anesthetized rat brain and modeled the spontaneous signal as a scale-free (i.e., fractal) distribution of amplitude power (|A|(2)) across a frequency range (f) compatible with an |A(f)|(2)∝1/f($\beta$) model where $\beta$ is the scaling exponent (or spectral index). We compared $\beta$ values from somatosensory forelimb area (S1FL), cingulate cortex (CG), and caudate putamen (CPu). With $\alpha$-chloralose, S1FL and CG $\beta$ values dropped from \~{}0.7 at in vivo to \~{}0.1 at post mortem (p<0.0002), whereas CPu $\beta$ values dropped from \~{}0.3 at in vivo to \~{}0.1 at post mortem (p<0.002). With domitor, cortical (S1FL, CG) $\beta$ values were slightly higher than with $\alpha$-chloralose, while subcortical (CPu) $\beta$ values were similar with $\alpha$-chloralose. Although cortical and subcortical $\beta$ values with both anesthetics were significantly different in vivo (p<0.002), at post mortem $\beta$ values in these regions were not significantly different and approached zero (i.e., range of -0.1 to 0.2). Since a water phantom devoid of susceptibility gradients had a $\beta$ value of zero (i.e., random), we conclude that deoxyhemoglobin present in voxels post-sacrifice still impacts tissue water diffusion. These results suggest that in the anesthetized rat brain the LFF of BOLD signal at 11.7T follow a general 1/f($\beta$) model of fractality where $\beta$ is a variable responding to physiology. We describe typical experimental pitfalls which may elude detection of fractality in the resting-state BOLD signal.",

    title = "{Functional integration in schizophrenia: too little or too much? Preliminary results on fMRI data.}",
    abstract = {The disconnectivity hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia results from poor or miswired anatomical connections. Theoretically, its functional counterpart should be disintegration. Integration is thought to allow segregated neurons to interact as a coherent whole, referred to as the "core", while the non-interacting part of the brain is referred to as the "rest". In this study, it is suggested that schizophrenia is the result of rest noise interfering with core activity. Two possible causes are assessed: (i) defective core integration, making the core more vulnerable to noise from the rest, or (ii) the rest being too highly integrated, meaning that it can interfere with the core. These hypotheses were tested using fMRI data acquired from 13 stabilized medicated schizophrenic subjects compared to 11 matched controls. Subjects were required to perform a series of lexical decision and retrieval tasks in separate sessions. The brain was divided into 90 components. Integration was defined as the amount of information shared between the components of a sub-system. An iterative aggregation procedure made it possible to identify a core on the basis of the functional clustering index, which assesses the integration of the core relative to its integration with the rest. Correlation of component-pairs within the core was also compared between the two groups. This procedure was repeated for each subject and for each task. Cores did not differ between the two groups, either in terms of integration or in terms of functional clustering index. However, the core was still highly integrated with the rest and the rest was overly integrated in schizophrenic subjects. Both anomalies were correlated with the negative symptoms. These findings were consistent regardless of the task considered. Furthermore, within the core, anterior-posterior correlations were lower in patients (between the frontal and the parietal and posterior cingulate cortices), whereas frontal left-right correlations were excessive. No significant correlation was found with the medication. Thus, it appears that schizophrenia entails a deleterious combination of too much "noisy" integration (from the rest) and too little "significant" integration (anterior-posterior functional connectivity)},

All intelligence tests were performed using the China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Each subject's full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and memory/caution (M/C) factor was measured and recorded. Resting state fMRI scans were performed on a 3.0-T MR scanner and post-processed using REST software. Comparisons of z-score correlation coefficients between distinct cerebral regions were used to identify altered functional connectivity in PNE children.RESULTS: The PNE group had normal FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ values, indicating no significant variation from the control group. However, the M/C factor was significantly lower in the PNE group. Compared to the control group, PNE children exhibited overall lower levels of functional connectivity that were most apparent in the cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathway. The M/C factor significantly correlated with z-scores representing connectivity between Cerebellum\_Crus1\_L and Frontal\_Mid\_R.CONCLUSION: PNE children exhibit intelligence structure imbalance and attention deficits. Our findings suggest that cerebello-thalamo-frontal circuit abnormalities are likely to be involved in the onset and progression of attention impairment in PNE children",

This study characterizes the default-mode network activity in late-life depression and the correlation of the default-mode network activity changes with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. We hypothesized that elderly depressed subjects would have altered default-mode network activity, which would correlate with the increased white-matter hyperintensities burden. Twelve depressed subjects (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 19.8±4.1, mean age 70.5±4.9) and 12 non-depressed, comparison subjects (mean age 69±6.5) were included. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while subjects performed a low cognitive load, event-related task. We compared the default-mode network activity in these groups (including depressed subjects pre- and post-antidepressant treatment). We analyzed the resting connectivity patterns of the posterior cingulate cortex. Deconvolution was used to evaluate the correlation of resting-state connectivity scores with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Compared with non-depressed elderly, depressed subjects pretreatment had decreased connectivity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and increased connectivity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the orbito-frontal cortex. The abnormal connectivity was significantly correlated with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Remitted elderly depressed subjects had improved functional connectivity compared to pretreatment, although alterations persisted in the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex when remitted elderly depressed subjects were compared with non-depressed elderly. Our study provides evidence for altered default-mode network connectivity in late-life depression. The correlation between white-matter hyperintensities burden and default-mode network connectivity emphasizes the role of vascular changes in late-life depression etiopathogenesis.",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate if resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) reliably can serve as a complement to task-based fMRI for presurgical mapping of the sensorimotor cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Functional data were obtained in 10 healthy volunteers using a 3 Tesla MRI system. Each subject performed five bilateral finger tapping experiments interleaved with five resting-state experiments. Following preprocessing, data from eight volunteers were further analyzed with the general linear model (finger tapping data) and independent component analysis (rest data). Test-retest reliability estimates (hit rate and false alarm rate) for resting-state fMRI activation of the sensorimotor network were compared with the reliability estimates for task-evoked activation of the sensorimotor cortex. The reliability estimates constituted a receiver operating characteristics curve from which the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Statistical testing was performed to compare the two groups with respect to reliability. RESULTS: The AUC was generally higher for the task experiments, although median AUC was not significantly different on a group level. Also, the two groups showed comparable levels of within-group variance. CONCLUSION: Test-retest reliability was comparable between resting-state measurements and task-based fMRI, suggesting that presurgical mapping of functional networks can be a supplement to task-based fMRI in cases where patient status excludes task-based fMRI.

    abstract = {In the last few years, the notion that the brain has a default or intrinsic mode of functioning has received increasing attention. The idea derives from observations that a consistent network of brain regions shows high levels of activity when no explicit task is performed and participants are asked simply to rest. The importance of this putative "default mode" is asserted on the basis of the substantial energy demand associated with such a resting state and of the suggestion that rest entails a finely tuned balance between metabolic demand and regionally regulated blood supply. These observations, together with the fact that the default network is more active at rest than it is in a range of explicit tasks, have led some to suggest that it reflects an absolute baseline, one that must be understood and used if we are to develop a comprehensive picture of brain functioning. Here, we examine the assumptions that are generally made in accepting the importance of the "default mode". We question the value, and indeed the interpretability, of the study of the resting state and suggest that observations made under resting conditions have no privileged status as a fundamental metric of brain functioning. In doing so, we challenge the utility of studies of the resting state in a number of important domains of research.},

However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in MCI. Furthermore, the longitudinal changes of the hippocampal connectivity have not been reported. In the study, resting state functional MRI (fMRI) was used to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 14 patients and 14 healthy age-matched controls. We found that functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in MCI, these regions are: the right frontal lobe, the bilateral temporal lobe and the right insular. While, the left posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, hippocampus, caudate and right occipital gyrus showed increased connectivity to the hippocampus in MCI. Additionally, we traced the seven MCI patients and compared the hippocampal connectivity in initial stage and 3years later stage. Several regions presented decreased connectivity to the hippocampus after 3years. Finally, the hippocampal connectivity with some regions showed significant correlation with the cognitive performance of patients. Based on these findings, the decreased hippocampal connectivity might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampal cortical memory network in MCI. In addition, the increased hippocampal connectivity suggested compensation for the loss of memory function. With the development of the disease, the hippocampal connectivity may lose some compensation and add some more disruption due to the pathological changes.",

Using functional connectivity tools, it is possible to investigate a specific RS-fMRI network, referred to as "default-mode" (DM) network, that involves cortical regions deactivated in fMRI experiments with cognitive tasks. Previous works have reported a significant effect of aging on DM regions activity. Independent component analysis (ICA) is often used for generating spatially distributed DM functional connectivity patterns from RS-fMRI data without the need for a reference region. This aspect and the relatively easy setup of an RS-fMRI experiment even in clinical trials have boosted the combined use of RS-fMRI and ICA-based DM analysis for noninvasive research of brain disorders. In this work, we considered different strategies for combining ICA results from individual-level and population-level analyses and used them to evaluate and predict the effect of aging on the DM component. Using RS-fMRI data from 20 normal subjects and a previously developed group-level ICA methodology, we generated group DM maps and showed that the overall ICA-DM connectivity is negatively correlated with age. A negative correlation of the ICA voxel weights with age existed in all DM regions at a variable degree. As an alternative approach, we generated a distributed DM spatial template and evaluated the correlation of each individual DM component fit to this template with age. Using a "leave-one-out" procedure, we discuss the importance of removing the bias from the DM template-generation process},

However, so far, little is known about the exact neuro-pathophysiological mechanism of TIPS's effects on brain function. We aimed to investigate the dynamics of brain function alteration of post-TIPS patients using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen cirrhotic patients who were scheduled for TIPS and 16 healthy controls were included in the rs-fMRI scans. Ten patients repeated the MRI study in a median 8-day follow-up interval following TIPS and seven in a median 3-month follow-up. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), an index reflecting the spontaneous brain activity, was compared between patients before TIPS and healthy controls as well as patients pre- and post- TIPS.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients showed decreased ALFF in frontal and parietal regions and increased ALFF in insula. Patients who underwent the median 8-day follow-up fMRI examinations showed decreased ALFF in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and increased ALFF in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Of 10 patients in this group, 9 had moderate to large increase rate of ALFF value (>20\%, mean 49.19\%) in ACC, while only one patient with the smallest increase rate of ALFF value (<10\%) in ACC, who experienced three episodes of overt HE during the 3-month follow-up. In the median 3-month follow up observation, patients displayed persistently decreased ALFF in PCC, ACC and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while no increased regional ALFF was observed.CONCLUSION: TIPS insertion alters cirrhotic patients' ALFF patterns in the resting state, which may imply different short-term and moderate-term effects on cirrhotic patients, i.e., both impairment and compensatory mechanism of brain functions in peri-TIPS and continuous impairment of brain function 3 months following TIPS",

We asked whether the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal reflects these modulations. BOLD was measured under three steady-state conditions: while subjects kept their eyes closed, kept their eyes open, or while fixating. The BOLD spectral density was calculated across brain voxels and subjects. Visual, sensory-motor, auditory, and retrosplenial cortex showed modulations of the BOLD spectral density by resting state type. All modulated regions showed greater spontaneous BOLD oscillations in the eyes closed than the eyes open or fixation conditions, suggesting that the differences were endogenously driven. Next, we examined the pattern of correlations between regions whose ongoing BOLD signal was modulated by resting state type. Regional neuronal correlations were estimated using an analytic procedure from the comparison of BOLD-BOLD covariances in the fixation and eyes closed conditions. Most regions were highly correlated with one another, with the exception of the primary visual cortices, which showed low correlations with the other regions. In conclusion, changes in resting state were associated with synchronous modulations of spontaneous BOLD oscillations in cortical sensory areas driven by two spatially overlapping, but temporally uncorrelated signals.",

    abstract = "The investigation of cerebral resting-state networks (RSNs) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising tool for the early diagnosis and follow-up of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, the determination of inter-session reliability of these networks is crucial. However, data on network reliability in healthy elderly subjects is rare and does not exist for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a prodromal stage of AD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term test-retest reliability of RSNs in both groups. Twelve healthy controls (HC) and 13 aMCI patients underwent resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological testing (CERAD test battery) twice, at baseline and after 13-16 months. Resting-state fMRI data was decomposed into independent components using independent component analysis. Inter-session test-retest reliability of the resulting RSNs was determined by calculating voxel-wise intra-class correlation coefficients. Overall test-retest reliability of corresponding RSNs was moderate to high in both groups, but significantly higher in the HC group compared to the aMCI group (p < 0.001), while the cognitive performance within the CERAD test battery remained stable over time in either group. Most reliable RSNs derived from the HC group and were associated with sensory and motor as well as higher order cognitive and the default-mode function. Particularly low reliability was found in basal frontal regions, which are known to be prone to susceptibility-induced noise. We conclude that stable RSNs may represent healthy aging, whereas decreased RSN reliability may indicate progressive neuro-functional alterations before the actual manifestation of clinical symptoms",

In the present study, we used an artificial grammar learning (AGL) task to determine the ability to extract grammatical rules from new material in healthy older adults. White matter microstructure and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of task-relevant brain regions were assessed using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging. AGL performance correlated positively with fractional anisotropy (FA) underlying left and right Brodmann areas (BA) 44/45 and in tracts originating from left BA 44/45. An inverse relationship was found between task performance and FC of left and right BA 44/45, linking lower performance to stronger inter-hemispheric functional coupling. Our results suggest that white matter microstructure underlying specific prefrontal regions and their functional coupling affect acquisition of syntactic knowledge in the aging brain, offering further insight into mechanisms of functional decline in older adults",

It was applied to spontaneous fMRI signals acquired from anesthetized rats, and the results were then compared with those obtained using independent component analysis (ICA), one of the most popular multivariate analysis method for analyzing spontaneous fMRI signals. It was demonstrated that the CMBHC has a higher sensitivity than the ICA, particularly on a single run data, for identifying correlation structures with relatively weak connections, for instance, the thalamocortical connections. Compared to the seed-based correlation analysis, the CMBHC does not require a priori information and thus can avoid potential biases caused by seed selection, and multiple patterns can be extracted at one time. In contrast to other multivariate methods, the CMBHC is based on spatiotemporal correlations of fMRI signals and its analysis outcomes are easy to interpret as the strength of functional connectivity. Moreover, its sensitivity of detecting patterns remains relatively high even for a single dataset. In conclusion, the CMBHC method could be a useful tool for investigating resting-state brain connectivity and function",

However, the full extent of this network and the white matter pathways that contribute to it remain to be characterized. In an earlier voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis of data from aphasic patients (Dronkers et al., 2004), several brain regions in the left hemisphere were found to be critical for language comprehension: the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, the anterior part of Brodmann's area 22 in the superior temporal gyrus (anterior STG/BA22), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) extending into Brodmann's area 39 (STS/BA39), the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (BA47), and the middle frontal gyrus (BA46). Here, we investigated the white matter pathways associated with these regions using diffusion tensor imaging from healthy subjects. We also used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to assess the functional connectivity profiles of these regions. Fiber tractography and functional connectivity analyses indicated that the left MTG, anterior STG/BA22, STS/BA39, and BA47 are part of a richly interconnected network that extends to additional frontal, parietal, and temporal regions in the two hemispheres. The inferior occipito-frontal fasciculus, the arcuate fasciculus, and the middle and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, as well as transcallosal projections via the tapetum were found to be the most prominent white matter pathways bridging the regions important for language comprehension. The left MTG showed a particularly extensive structural and functional connectivity pattern which is consistent with the severity of the impairments associated with MTG lesions and which suggests a central role for this region in language comprehension",

All participants provided written informed consent. Neuropsychiatric tests including number connection test type A and digit symbol test were used to define minimal HE. Twenty-three patients with minimal HE and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. Resting-state functional MR imaging was performed by using a 3-T MR imaging unit. Functional connectivities between 90 pairs of cortical and subcortical regions in patients with minimal HE were compared with those in control participants, and significantly different connectivities were chosen as connectivities of interest (COIs). Correlations between neuropsychiatric tests and correlation coefficients of COIs were calculated.Results:Among the 51 COIs that were significantly different in patients with minimal HE from those in control participants, 44 connectivities were weaker in patients with minimal HE. All 22 COIs related to subcortical regions of interest (bilateral putamen, pallidum, and thalamus) were weaker in patients with minimal HE. Of 29 cortical COIs, 22 connectivities were weaker and seven were stronger in patients with minimal HE. Nearly all COIs with significant differences correlated with digital symbol test scores (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). No correlation was found among blood ammonia level, Child-Pugh scores, or any COIs in patients with minimal HE (P > .05, false discovery rate corrected).Conclusion:Widespread cortical and subcortical network connectivity changes that correlated with neuropsychologic impairment were found in patients with minimal HE. In particular, impairment in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit could play an important role in mediating neurocognitive dysfunction, especially for psychomotor speed and attention deficits in patients with minimal HE.© RSNA, 2012Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120185/-/DC1",

Such complications have been studied extensively, but the pathoetiology of NP-SLE has not yet been elucidated. Diagnosis of NP-SLE focuses primarily on psychological manifestations, and the underlying mechanisms leading to neuropsychiatric complications remain unknown. To address potential changes in brain function before NP-SLE development, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to compare regional brain activity in SLE patients versus matched controls. We report that regional activity in cerebellum and in areas of the default mode network are attenuated in patients with SLE, and moreover individual alterations in cerebellar activity correlated positively with the disease activity index. These findings provide direct evidence that significant alteration of brain function, resembling that observed in patients with NP-SLE, is already present in SLE patients without neuropsychiatric complications, highlighting the need for early evaluation and intervention in SLE patients. Furthermore, the disease activity rating correlated with regional functional alterations in the cerebellum, suggesting that the cerebellum could play a role in the pathogenesis of NP-SLE.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Conjoint activity of the insula and amygdala has frequently been reported during emotional stimulation in general and in anxiety-related contexts in particular. However, direct connectivity between the insula and amygdala in this framework has received little attention so far. Studying whether inter-individual differences in anxiety reflect variation in insula-amygdala connectivity is a way to push forward the understanding of network-related aspects underlying anxious behavior. METHODS: To investigate functional and structural connectivity, we applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging in a group of 32 healthy subjects. Specific measures of connectivity between subregions of the insula and amygdala were related to subjects' anxiety levels. RESULTS: Resting-state functional connectivity between the anterior insula and the basolateral amygdala was strongly related to state anxiety, explaining 40\% of behavioral variance across subjects. This was substantiated by applying tractography, yielding a relationship between trait anxiety and axial diffusivity for a direct pathway between anterior insula and basolateral amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anterior insula and basolateral amygdala constitute a network part that is prominently linked to anxiety. Within this route, state and trait behavioral impacts seem to be specifically linked to dynamic functional and more static structural neural aspects, respectively. Insula-amygdala resting-state functional connectivity can be assessed in an easy and straightforward way and has high potential to serve as a biomarker for anxiety",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To identify the neural correlates of cognitive improvement in mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects following 12 weeks of donepezil treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) was used to measure the hippocampal functional connectivity (HFC) in 14 mild AD and 18 age-matched normal (CN) subjects. AD subjects were scanned at baseline and after donepezil treatment. CN subjects were scanned only at baseline as a reference to identify regions correlated or anticorrelated to the hippocampus. Before each scan, participants underwent cognitive, behavioral, and functional assessments. RESULTS: After donepezil treatment, neural correlates of cognitive improvement measured by Mini-Mental State Examination scores were identified in the left parahippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior frontal gyrus. Improvement in AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores correlated with the HFC changes in the left DLPFC and middle frontal gyrus. Stronger recovery in the network connectivity was associated with cognitive improvement. CONCLUSION: R-fMRI may provide novel insights into the brain's responses to AD treatment in clinical pharmacological trials, and also may predict clinical response. J. Magn. Reson.

The fMRI experiment was performed before, during and after acupuncture manipulations on healthy volunteers at an acupuncture point, which was previously implicated in a neural pathway for pain modulation. We first identified significant fMRI signal changes during acupuncture stimulation in the left amygdala, which was subsequently selected as a functional reference for connectivity analyses. Our results have demonstrated that there is a brain network associated with the amygdala during a resting condition. This network encompasses the brain structures that are implicated in both pain sensation and pain modulation. We also found that such a pain-related network could be modulated by both verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Furthermore, compared with a sham acupuncture, the verum acupuncture induced a higher level of correlations among the amygdala-associated network.CONCLUSION:Our findings indicate that acupuncture may change this amygdala-specific brain network into a functional state that underlies pain perception and pain modulation.",

    abstract = "Two modes of interactions between brain regions have held prominence -synchronization and causal influence. Investigation of causality from fMRI has relied on model-driven approaches such as dynamic causal modeling, and data-driven approaches such as Granger causality analysis (GCA). Recent articles have focused on their merits and caveats, which can be classified into simulations, theoretical developments and experiments. In the first part, we consider each of these themes and critically evaluate their arguments, with regard to GCA. Specifically, we argue that simulations are bounded by the assumptions and simplifications made by the simulator and must be regarded only as a guide to experimental design and should not be viewed as the final word. On the theoretical front, we reason that each of the improvements to existing, yet disparate, methods bring them close to each other with the hope of eventually leading to a unified framework specifically designed for fMRI. We then review latest experimental results which demonstrate the utility and validity of GCA under certain experimental conditions. In the second part, we will consider current issues in causal connectivity analysis - hemodynamic variability, sampling, instantaneous vs. causal relationship, and task vs. resting states. We highlight some of our own work regarding these issues showing the effect of hemodynamic variability and sampling on GC. Further, we discuss recent techniques such as the cubature Kalman filtering which can perform blind deconvolution of the hemodynamic response robustly well and hence enabling wider application of GCA. Finally, we discuss our previous work on the less appreciated interactions between instantaneous and causal relationships and finally the utility and interpretation of GC results obtained from task versus resting state (e.g. ability of causal relationships to provide a mode of connectivity between regions which are instantaneously dissociated in resting state). We conclude by discussing future directions in this area",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Functional brain imaging studies have indicated that distinct anatomical brain regions can show coherent spontaneous neuronal activity during rest. Regions that show such correlated behavior are said to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input in selecting meaningful networks.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD sensitive fMRI scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently reported default mode network. The found RSNs showed large overlap with recently reported resting-state results and support the idea of the formation of spatially distinct RSNs during rest in the human brain",

    abstract = "Phase locking or synchronization of brain areas is a key concept of information processing in the brain. Synchronous oscillations have been observed and investigated extensively in EEG during the past decades. EEG oscillations occur over a wide frequency range. In EEG, a prominent type of oscillations is alpha-band activity, present typically when a subject is awake, but at rest with closed eyes. The spectral power of alpha rhythms has recently been investigated in simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings, establishing a wide-range cortico-thalamic network. However, spectral power and synchronization are different measures and little is known about the correlations between BOLD effects and EEG synchronization. Interestingly, the fMRI BOLD signal also displays synchronous oscillations across different brain regions. These oscillations delineate so-called resting state networks (RSNs) that resemble the correlation patterns of simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. However, the nature of these BOLD oscillations and their relations to EEG activity is still poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the subunits constituting a specific RSN may be coordinated by different EEG rhythms. In this study we report on evidence for this hypothesis. The BOLD correlates of global EEG synchronization (GFS) in the alpha frequency band are located in brain areas involved in specific RSNs, e.g. the 'default mode network'. Furthermore, our results confirm the hypothesis that specific RSNs are organized by long-range synchronization at least in the alpha frequency band. Finally, we could localize specific areas where the GFS BOLD correlates and the associated RSN overlap. Thus, we claim that not only the spectral dynamics of EEG are important, but also their spatio-temporal organization.",

However, the neural correlates of this relationship are poorly understood. Our aim was to examine whether interactive effects of memory deficits and depressive symptoms are present in the memory-associated functional networks, in nondemented elderly subjects. Fifteen subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 20 age-matched normal (CN) elderly subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (R-fMRI) measured the hippocampal functional connectivity (HFC) alterations between the two groups. Voxelwise linear regression analysis was performed to correlate hippocampal network strength with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall and the Geriatric Depression Scale scores, after adjusting for age and group effects. Poorer memory performance was associated with decreased positively correlated HFC connectivity in the specific frontal lobe and default mode network (DMN) structures. Poorer memory performance also was associated with decreased anticorrelated HFC connectivity in the bilateral inferior parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. In contrast, greater depressive symptom severity was associated with increased HFC connectivity in several frontal lobes and DMN regions. Depressive symptoms and memory functions had interactive effects on the HFC, in the frontal, temporal, and PCC structures. Our findings suggest that the R-fMRI technique can be used to examine the changes in functional neural networks where memory deficits and depressive symptoms coexist in the geriatric population.",

We found that all three sensory systems exhibited significant negative correlation with the intrinsic system. In contrast, positive correlations between these sensory cortices and brain regions outside their respective system were limited. The present study extended former findings by indicating that multiple subsystems rather than a single subsystem of the extrinsic system are inherently negatively correlated with the intrinsic system.

    abstract = "Impaired attention ('difficulty concentrating') is a cognitive symptom of nicotine withdrawal that may be an important contributor to smoking relapse. However, the neurobiological basis of this effect and the potentially beneficial effects of nicotine replacement therapy both remain unclear. We used functional MRI with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording to define brain activity correlates of cognitive impairment with short-term smoking cessation in habitual smokers and the effects of nicotine replacement. We found that irrespective of treatment (ie nicotine or placebo) EEG $\alpha$ power was negatively correlated with increased activation during performance of a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) task in dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, parietal, and insular cortices, as well as, caudate, and thalamus. Relative to placebo, nicotine replacement further increased the $\alpha$-correlated activation across these regions. We also found that EEG $\alpha$ power was negatively correlated with RVIP-induced deactivation in regions comprising the 'default mode' network (ie angular gyrus, cuneus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These $\alpha$-correlated deactivations were further reduced by nicotine. These findings confirm that effects of nicotine on cognition during short-term smoking cessation occur with modulation of neuronal sources common to the generation of both the blood oxygen-level-dependent and $\alpha$ EEG signals. Our observations thus demonstrate that nicotine replacement in smokers has direct pharmacological effects on brain neuronal activity modulating cognitive networks",

    abstract = {Simultaneous electroencephalogram/functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) during interictal epileptiform discharges can result in positive (activation) and negative (deactivation) changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Activation probably reflects increased neuronal activity and energy demand, but deactivation is more difficult to explain. Our objective was to evaluate the occurrence and significance of deactivations related to epileptiform discharges in epilepsy. We reviewed all EEG-fMRI studies from our database, identified those with robust responses (P = 0.01, with > or =5 contiguous voxels with a |t| > 3.1, including > or =1 voxel at |t| > 5.0), and divided them into three groups: activation (A = 8), deactivation (D = 9), and both responses (AD = 43). We correlated responses with discharge type and location and evaluated their spatial relationship with regions involved in the "default" brain state (Raichle et al. [2001]: Proc Natl Acad Sci 98:676-682]. Deactivations were seen in 52/60 studies (AD + D): 26 related to focal discharges, 12 bilateral, and 14 generalized. Deactivations were usually distant from anatomical areas related to the discharges and more frequently related to polyspike- and spike-and-slow waves than to spikes. The "default" pattern occurred in 10/43 AD studies, often associated with bursts of generalized discharges. In conclusion, deactivations are frequent, mostly with concomitant activation, for focal and generalized discharges. Discharges followed by a slow wave are more likely to result in deactivation, suggesting neuronal inhibition as the underlying phenomenon. Involvement of the "default" areas, related to bursts of generalized discharges, provides evidence of a subclinical effect of the discharges, temporarily suspending normal brain function in the resting state.},

    abstract = "Advanced neuroimaging techniques have been increasingly applied to the study of preterm and term infants in an effort to further define the functional cerebral architecture of the developing brain. Despite improved understanding of the complex relationship between structure and function obtained through these investigations, significant questions remain regarding the nature, location, and timing of the maturational changes which occur during early development. Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) utilizes spontaneous, low frequency (< 0.1 Hz), coherent fluctuations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal to identify networks of functional cerebral connections. Due to the intrinsic characteristics of its image acquisition and analysis, fcMRI offers a novel neuroimaging approach well suited to investigation of infants. Recently, this methodology has been successfully applied to examine neonatal populations, defining normative patterns of large-scale neural network development in the maturing brain. The resting-state networks (RSNs) identified in these studies reflect the evolving cerebral structural architecture, presumably driven by varied genetic and environmental influences. Principal features of these investigations and their role in characterization of the tenets of neural network development during this critical developmental period are highlighted in this review. Despite these successes, optimal methods for fcMRI data acquisition and analysis for this population have not yet been defined. Further, appropriate schemes for interpretation and translation of fcMRI results remain unknown, a matter of increasing importance as functional neuroimaging findings are progressively applied in the clinical arena. Notwithstanding these concerns, fcMRI provides insight into the earliest forms of cerebral connectivity and therefore holds great promise for future neurodevelopmental investigations.",

    abstract = {The rising interest in temporally coherent brain networks during baseline adult cerebral activity finds convergent evidence for an identifiable set of resting state networks (RSNs). To date, little is know concerning the earlier developmental stages of functional connectivity in RSNs. This study's main objective is to characterize the RSNs in a sample of adolescents. We further examine our data from a developmental psychopathology perspective of psychosis-proneness, by testing the hypothesis that early schizotypal symptoms are linked to disconnection in RSNs. In this perspective, this study examines the expression of adolescent schizotypal traits and their potential associations to dysfunctional RSNs. Thirty-nine adolescents aged between 12 and 20 years old underwent an 8-min functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) "resting state" session. In order to explore schizotypal trait manifestations, the entire population was assessed by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). After conventional processing of the fMRI data, we applied group-level independent component analysis (ICA). Twenty ICA maps and associated time courses were obtained, among which there were RSNs that are consistent with findings in the literature. We applied a regression analysis at group level between the energy of RSN-associated time courses in different temporal frequency bins and the clinical measures (3 in total). Our results highlight the engagement of six relevant RSNs; (1) a default-mode network (DMN); (2) a dorso-lateral attention network; (3) a visual network (VN); (4) an auditory network (AN); (5) a sensory motor network (SMN); (6) a self-referential network (SRN). The regression analysis reveals a statistically significant correlation between the clinical measures and some of the RSNs, specifically the visual and the AN. In particular, a positive correlation is obtained for the VN in the low frequency range (0.05 Hz) with SPQ measures, while the AN correlates negatively in the high frequency range (0.16-0.19 Hz). Trend-like significance for the SRN may hint to its implication in disorganized thoughts and behaviors during adolescence. Unlike DMN activity in schizophrenic patients, adolescent DMN was unrelated to schizotypal trait expression. This suggests that relationships between the DMN and schizotypy may be modified in later developmental stages of both functional connectivity and psychotic expression. These results are discussed in light of RSNs literature involving children, adults, and individuals with schizophrenia.},

    abstract = {A significant component of BOLD fMRI physiological noise is caused by variations in the depth and rate of respiration. It has previously been demonstrated that a breath-to-breath metric of respiratory variation (respiratory volume per time; RVT), computed from pneumatic belt measurements of chest expansion, has a strong linear relationship with resting-state BOLD signals across the brain. RVT is believed to capture breathing-induced changes in arterial CO(2), which is a cerebral vasodilator; indeed, separate studies have found that spontaneous fluctuations in end-tidal CO(2) (PETCO(2)) are correlated with BOLD signal time series. The present study quantifies the degree to which RVT and PETCO(2) measurements relate to one another and explain common aspects of the resting-state BOLD signal. It is found that RVT (particularly when convolved with a particular impulse response, the "respiration response function") is highly correlated with PETCO(2), and that both explain remarkably similar spatial and temporal BOLD signal variance across the brain. In addition, end-tidal O(2) is shown to be largely redundant with PETCO(2). Finally, the latency at which PETCO(2) and respiration belt measures are correlated with the time series of individual voxels is found to vary across the brain and may reveal properties of intrinsic vascular response delays.},

A significant "treatment × time" interaction was found for the increased FC of the right IPL and for the decreased FC of the right ITG.

    abstract = "Various functional imaging tools have been used to detect epileptic activity in the neural network underlying mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). In the present fMRI study, a data-driven approach was employed to map interictal epileptic activity in mTLE patients by measuring the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Twenty-four left mTLE patients and 26 right mTLE patients were investigated by comparing with 25 healthy subjects. In the patients, the regions showing increased ALFF were consistently distributed in the mesial temporal lobe, thalamus, and a few of other cortical and subcortical structures composing a mesial temporal epilepsy network proposed previously, while the regions showing decreased ALFF were mostly located in the areas of so-called default-mode network. Data of simultaneous EEG-fMRI from a portion of the patients suggested that the increases in ALFF might be associated with the interictal epileptic activity. Individual analyses based on statistic parametric mapping revealed a moderate sensitivity and a fairly high specificity for the lateralization of unilateral mTLE. We conclude that the ALFF analysis may provide a useful tool in fMRI study of epilepsy",

However, user-friendly toolbox for "pipeline" data analysis of resting-state fMRI is still lacking. Based on some functions in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST), we have developed a MATLAB toolbox called Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI (DPARSF) for "pipeline" data analysis of resting-state fMRI. After the user arranges the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files and click a few buttons to set parameters, DPARSF will then give all the preprocessed (slice timing, realign, normalize, smooth) data and results for functional connectivity, regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and fractional ALFF. DPARSF can also create a report for excluding subjects with excessive head motion and generate a set of pictures for easily checking the effect of normalization. In addition, users can also use DPARSF to extract time courses from regions of interest.},

    abstract = "Complex network analyses of functional connectivity have consistently revealed non-random (modular, small-world, scale-free-like) behavior of hard-thresholded networks constructed from the right-tail of the similarity histogram. In the present study we determined network properties resulting from edges constrained to specific ranges across the full correlation histogram, in particular the left (negative-most) tail, and their dependence on the confound signal removal strategy employed. In the absence of global signal correction, left-tail networks comprised predominantly long range connections associated with weak correlations and were characterized by substantially reduced modularity and clustering, negative assortativity and $\gamma$<1 Deconvolution of specific confound signals (white matter, CSF and motion) resulted in the most robust within-subject reproducibility of global network parameters (ICCs\~{}0.5). Global signal removal altered the network topology in the left tail, with the clustering coefficient and assortativity converging to zero. Networks constructed from the absolute value of the correlation coefficient were thus compromised following global signal removal since the different right-tail and left-tail topologies were mixed. These findings informed the construction of soft-thresholded networks, replacing the hard thresholding or binarization operation with a continuous mapping of all correlation values to edge weights, suppressing rather than removing weaker connections and avoiding issues related to network fragmentation. A power law adjacency function with $\beta$=12 yielded modular networks whose parameters agreed well with corresponding hard-thresholded values, that were reproducible in repeated sessions across many months and evidenced small-world-like and scale-free-like properties.",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the whole-brain resting-state networks in a homogeneous group of patients with acute mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and to identify alterations in functional connectivity induced by MTBI. METHODS:Thirty-five patients with acute MTBI and 35 healthy control subjects, matched in age, gender, handedness, and education, underwent resting-state fMRI, susceptibility weighted imaging, neuropsychological, and postconcussive symptom assessments. We ensured the homogeneity of the patient group by limiting the injury mechanism to fronto-occipital impacts. Alterations in functional connectivity were analyzed by using data-driven independent component analysis, which is not biased by a priori region selection. RESULTS:We found a decrease in functional connectivity within the motor-striatal network in the MTBI group. At the same time, patients showed deficits in psychomotor speed as well as in speed of information processing. We propose that although disorders in motor function after MTBI are rarely reported, injury still has an effect on motor functioning, which in its turn may also explain the reduction in speed of information processing. Further, we found a cluster of increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network in the MTBI group. We suggest that this abnormal increased connectivity might reflect increased awareness to external environment and explain excessive cognitive fatigue reported by patients with MTBI. It might also underlie the physical postconcussive symptoms, such as headache and increased sensitivity to noise/light. CONCLUSIONS:We proved that whole-brain functional connectivity is altered early (within 4 weeks) after MTBI, suggesting that changes in functional networks underlie the cognitive deficits and postconcussive complaints reported by patients with MTBI",

Here we sought to determine if pathological effects of apolipoprotein E $\epsilon$4 (APOE4) genotype could be seen independent of A$\beta$ plaque toxicity by examining resting state fMRI functional connectivity (fcMRI) in participants without preclinical fibrillar amyloid deposition (PIB-). Cognitively normal participants enrolled in longitudinal studies (n = 100, mean age = 62) who were PIB- were categorized into those with and without an APOE4 allele and studied using fcMRI. APOE4 allele carriers (E4+) differed significantly from E4- in functional connectivity of the precuneus to several regions previously defined as having abnormal connectivity in a group of AD participants. These effects were observed before any manifestations of cognitive changes and in the absence of brain fibrillar A$\beta$ plaque deposition, suggesting that early manifestations of a genetic effect can be detected using fcMRI and that these changes may antedate the pathological effects of fibrillar amyloid plaque toxicity.",

Pain and anxiety can be effectively alleviated by hypnotic suggestion, which modulates activity in brain regions associated with focused attention, but the specific neural network underlying this phenomenon is not known. OBJECTIVE To investigate the brain basis of hypnotizability. DESIGN Cross-sectional, in vivo neuroimaging study performed from November 2005 through July 2006. SETTING Academic medical center at Stanford University School of Medicine. PATIENTS Twelve adults with high and 12 adults with low hypnotizability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure functional connectivity networks at rest, including default-mode, salience, and executive-control networks; structural T1 magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional gray and white matter volumes; and diffusion tensor imaging to measure white matter microstructural integrity. RESULTS High compared with low hypnotizable individuals had greater functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an executive-control region of the brain, and the salience network composed of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, amygdala, and ventral striatum, involved in detecting, integrating, and filtering relevant somatic, autonomic, and emotional information using independent component analysis. Seed-based analysis confirmed elevated functional coupling between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in high compared with low hypnotizable individuals. These functional differences were not due to any variation in brain structure in these regions, including regional gray and white matter volumes and white matter microstructure. CONCLUSIONS Our results provide novel evidence that altered functional connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may underlie hypnotizability. Future studies focusing on how these functional networks change and interact during hypnosis are warranted",

Despite the accumulating evidence of brain plasticity, the interaction and significance of morphological and physiological modifications in post-stroke brain tissue remain mostly unclear. Neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enable in vivo assessment of the spatial and temporal pattern of functional and structural changes inside and outside ischemic lesion areas. This can contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects in post-stroke brain remodeling. Task/stimulus-related fMRI, resting-state fMRI, or pharmacological MRI enables direct or indirect measurement of neuronal activation, functional connectivity, or neurotransmitter system responses, respectively. DTI allows estimation of the structural integrity and connectivity of white matter tracts. Together, these MRI methods provide an unprecedented means to (a) measure longitudinal changes in tissue structure and function close by and remote from ischemic lesion areas, (b) evaluate the organizational profile of neural networks after stroke, and (c) identify degenerative and restorative processes that affect post-stroke functional outcome. Besides, the availability of MRI in clinical institutions as well as research laboratories provides an optimal basis for translational research on stroke recovery. This review gives an overview of the current status and perspectives of fMRI and DTI applications to study brain reorganization in experimental stroke models",

In this work, we investigate the automatic classification of ADHD subjects using the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequences of the brain. We show that brain can be modeled as a functional network, and certain properties of the networks differ in ADHD subjects from control subjects. We compute the pairwise correlation of brain voxels' activity over the time frame of the experimental protocol which helps to model the function of a brain as a network. Different network features are computed for each of the voxels constructing the network. The concatenation of the network features of all the voxels in a brain serves as the feature vector. Feature vectors from a set of subjects are then used to train a PCA-LDA (principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis) based classifier. We hypothesized that ADHD related differences lie in some specific regions of brain and using features only from those regions are sufficient to discriminate ADHD and control subjects. We propose a method to create a brain mask which includes the useful regions only and demonstrate that using the feature from the masked regions improves classification accuracy on the test data set. We train our classifier with 776 subjects, and test on 171 subjects provided by the Neuro Bureau for the ADHD-200 challenge. We demonstrate the utility of graph-motif features, specifically the maps that represent the frequency of participation of voxels in network cycles of length 3. The best classification performance (69.59\%) is achieved using 3-cycle map features with masking. Our proposed approach holds promise in being able to diagnose and understand the disorder",

We identified resting-state networks using Independent Component Analysis and tested whether the functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) depends upon the maturation of the underlying cingulum white matter tract. To determine the generalizability of this relationship, we also tested whether functional connectivity depends on white matter maturity between bilateral lateral prefrontal cortex (lateral PFC) within the executive control network. We found a positive relationship between mPFC-PCC connectivity and fractional anisotropy of the cingulum bundle; this positive relationship was moderated by the age of the subjects such that it was stronger in older children. By contrast, no such structure-function relationship emerged between right and left lateral PFC.

We sought to explore whether and how repeated migraine attacks influence intrinsic brain connectivity, as well as how activity in these networks correlates with clinical indicators of migraine.METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Resting-state fMRI data in twenty-three patients with migraines without aura (MwoA) and 23 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), in combination with a "dual-regression" technique to identify the group differences of three important pain-related networks [default mode network (DMN), bilateral central executive network (CEN), salience network (SN)] between the MwoA patients and HC. Compared with the HC, MwoA patients showed aberrant intrinsic connectivity within the bilateral CEN and SN, and greater connectivity between both the DMN and right CEN (rCEN) and the insula cortex - a critical region involving in pain processing. Furthermore, greater connectivity between both the DMN and rCEN and the insula correlated with duration of migraine.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide new insights into the characterization of migraine as a condition affecting brain activity in intrinsic connectivity networks. Moreover, the abnormalities may be the consequence of a persistent central neural system dysfunction, reflecting cumulative brain insults due to frequent ongoing migraine attacks},

    abstract = "The immature brain spontaneously expresses unique patterns of electrical activity that are believed to contribute to the development of neuronal networks. Certain electrographic features of this activity, particularly modulation on an infraslow time scale, resemble activity patterns observed in the mature brain at 'rest', loosely defined as the absence of an investigator imposed task. However, it is not clear whether the immature activity patterns observed at rest are precursors of the spontaneous neuronal activity that forms resting state networks in the adult. Here, we review recent studies that have explored the generative mechanisms of resting state activity during development in the primary sensory systems of premature human neonates and neonatal rodents. The remarkable hypothesis suggested by this work is that while resting state activity during the pre- and possibly near-term period can bear superficial resemblance to adult activity it is fundamentally different in terms of function and origin. During early development spontaneous thalamocortical activity in primary sensory regions is determined largely by transitory generators in the sensory periphery. This is in contrast to the adult, where spontaneous activity generated within thalamocortex, particularly by cortico-cortical connections, dominates. We therefore suggest a conservative interpretation of developmental mapping studies which are based on indirect measurement of activity (e.g. fMRI), or on the partitioning of EEG frequency using bands derived from adult studies. The generative mechanisms for brain activity at early ages are likely different from those of adults, and may play very different roles; for example in circuit formation as opposed to attention",

    abstract = "Existing spatial independent component analysis (ICA) methods for multi-subject fMRI datasets have mainly focused on detecting common components across subjects, under the assumption that all the subjects in a group share the same (identical) components. However, as a data-driven approach, ICA could potentially serve as an exploratory tool at multi-subject level, and help us uncover inter-subject differences in patterns of connectivity (e.g., find subtypes in patient populations). In this work, we propose a methodology named gRAICAR that exploits the data-driven nature of ICA to allow discovery of sub-groupings of subjects based on reproducibility of their ICA components. This technique allows us not only to find highly reproducible common components across subjects but also to explore (without a priori subject groupings) components that could classify all subjects into sub-groups. gRAICAR generalizes the reproducibility framework previously developed for single subjects (Ranking and averaging independent component analysis by reproducibility-RAICAR-[42], 2008) to multiple-subject analysis. For each group-level component, gRAICAR generates its reproducibility matrix and further computes two metrics, inter-subject consistency and intra-subject reliability, to characterize inter-subject variability and reflect contributions from individual subjects. Nonparametric tests are employed to examine the significance of both the inter-subject consistency and the separation of subject groups reflected in the component. Our validations based on simulated and experimental resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrated the advantage of gRAICAR in extracting features reflecting potential subject groupings. It may facilitate discovery of the underlying brain functional networks with substantial potential to inform our understandings of development, neurodegenerative conditions, and psychiatric disorders",

However, it remains unclear how this functional connectivity is related to PCC changes. We employed resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine brain regions with a functional connection to PCC in a mild AD group compared with matched control subjects. PCC connectivity was gathered by investigating synchronic low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations with a temporal correlation method. We found asymmetric PCC-left hippocampus, right dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus connectivity disruption. In addition, some other regions such as the bilateral visual cortex, the infero-temporal cortex, the posterior orbital frontal cortex, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus showed decreased functional connectivity to the PCC. There were also some regions, primarily in the left frontal-parietal cortices, that showed increased connectivity. These regions included the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex, the left basal ganglia and the left primary motor cortex. Impairments to memory, high vision-related functions and olfaction in AD can be explained by a disruption to the functional connection of resting-state networks. The results of increased connectivity may support the compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity could plausibly provide an early imaging biomarker for AD",

The cognitive correlates of this network have proven difficult to interrogate, but one hypothesis is that regions in the network process episodic memories and semantic knowledge integral to internally-generated mental activity. Here, we compare default-mode functional connectivity in the same group of subjects during rest and conscious sedation with midazolam, a state characterized by anterograde amnesia and a reduced level of consciousness. Although the DMN showed functional connectivity during both rest and conscious sedation, a direct comparison found that there was significantly reduced functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex during conscious sedation. These results confirm that low-frequency oscillations in the DMN persist and remain highly correlated even at reduced levels of consciousness. We hypothesize that focal reductions in DMN connectivity, as shown here in the posterior cingulate cortex, may represent a stable correlate of reduced consciousness",

This finding supports the view that the resting state is involved in self-consciousness, and that the right-hemisphere default state may play a major role in conscious processes.

Using group independent component analysis (ICA) on resting-state fMRI data, this study identified a resting state functional network that predominantly consisted of the basal ganglia in both healthy controls and patients with IGE. In order to gain a better understanding of the basal ganglia network(BGN) in IGE patients, we compared the BGN functional connectivity of controls with that of epilepsy patients, either with interictal epileptic discharges (with-discharge period, WDP) or without epileptic discharge (nondischarge period, NDP) while scanning. Compared with controls, functional connectivity of BGN in IGE patients demonstrated significantly more integration within BGN except cerebellum and supplementary motor area (SMA) during both periods. Compared with the NDP group, the increased functional connectivity was found in bilateral caudate nucleus and the putamen, and decreases were observed in the bilateral cerebellum and SMA in WDP group. In accord with the proposal that the basal ganglia modulates epileptic discharge activity, the results showed that the modulation enhanced the integration in BGN of patients, and modulation during WDP was stronger than that during NDP. Furthermore, reduction of functional connectivity in cerebellum and SMA, the abnormality might be further aggravated during WDP, was consistent with the behavioral manifestations with disturbed motor function in IGE. These resting-state fMRI findings in the current study provided evidence confirming the role of the BGN as an important modulator in IGE",

This study focuses on integrating multiple imaging modalities to identify individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, often an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is difficult to diagnose due to its very mild or insignificant symptoms of cognitive impairment. Recent emergence of brain network analysis has made characterization of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level possible, thus providing new avenues for brain diseases classification. Employing multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we attempt to integrate information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for improving classification performance. Our results indicate that the multimodality classification approach yields statistically significant improvement in accuracy over using each modality independently. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is 96.3\%, which is an increase of at least 7.4\% from the single modality-based methods and the direct data fusion method. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance gives an area of 0.953 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating excellent diagnostic power. The multimodality classification approach hence allows more accurate early detection of brain abnormalities with greater sensitivity",

Given the importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for higher executive functioning in MS, we here used the ACC as seed-point to test for differences and similarities in RS-FC related to sustained attention between MS patients and controls.DESIGN: Block-design rest phases of 3 Tesla fMRI data were analyzed to assess RS-FC in 31 patients (10 clinically isolated syndromes, 16 relapsing-remitting, 5 secondary progressive MS) and 31 age- and gender matched healthy controls (HC). Participants underwent extensive cognitive testing.OBSERVATIONS: In both groups, signal changes in several brain areas demonstrated significant correlation with RS-activity in the ACC. These comprised the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), insular cortices, the right caudate, right middle temporal gyrus, angular gyri, the right hippocampus, and the cerebellum. Compared to HC, patients showed increased FC between the ACC and the left angular gyrus, left PCC, and right postcentral gyrus. Better cognitive performance in the patients was associated with increased FC to the cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, occipital pole, and the angular gyrus.CONCLUSION: We provide evidence for adaptive changes in RS-FC in MS patients compared to HC in a sustained attention network. These results extend and partly mirror findings of task-related fMRI, suggesting FC may increase our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in MS",

Independent component analysis was used to separate SRN, and a further cross-correlation approach was recruited to explore the relationship between SRN and other resting-state networks.RESULTS: Compared to controls, selective changes of SRN regarding to the increased functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbital prefrontal cortex/gyrus rectus and the mean time series of SRN at baseline in aMCI, while these functional connections were associated with more extent of longitudinal diminish after follow up in the same subjects.

Network nodes identified from eight widely replicated functional intrinsic connectivity networks served as seed regions to map whole-brain structural covariance patterns in each age group. In general, structural covariance in the youngest age group was limited to seed and contralateral homologous regions. Networks derived using primary sensory and motor cortex seeds were already well-developed in early childhood but expanded in early adolescence before pruning to a more restricted topology resembling adult intrinsic connectivity network patterns. In contrast, language, social-emotional, and other cognitive networks were relatively undeveloped in younger age groups and showed increasingly distributed topology in older children. The so-called default-mode network provided a notable exception, following a developmental trajectory more similar to the primary sensorimotor systems. Relationships between functional maturation and structural covariance networks topology warrant future exploration.",

Resting-state brain activity in patients with migraine provides clues to the pathophysiology of the disease.

In the current study, we employed a data-driven method, regional homogeneity (ReHo), to analyze the local features of spontaneous brain activity in patients with migraine without aura during the resting state. Twenty-six patients with migraine without aura and 26 age-, education- and gender-matched healthy volunteers participated in this study. Compared with healthy controls, patients with migraine without aura showed a significant decrease in ReHo values in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA). In addition, we found that ReHo values were negatively correlated with the duration of disease in the right rACC and PFC. Our results suggest that the resting-state abnormalities of these regions may be associated with functional impairments in pain processing in patients with migraine without aura.

We found the two measurements differed mainly in some brain regions where physiological noise is dominant. We also compared the sensitivity of these methods in detecting difference between resting-state conditions [eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC)] and in detecting abnormal local synchronization between two groups [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients vs. normal controls]. Our results indicated that Cohe-ReHo is more sensitive than KCC-ReHo to the difference between two conditions (EO vs. EC) as well as that between ADHD and normal controls. These preliminary results suggest that Cohe-ReHo is superior to KCC-ReHo. A possible reason is that coherence is not susceptible to random noise induced by phase delay among the time courses to be measured.

Several evidences support the hypothesis of a structural and functional brain reorganization in transgender subjects, with a different impact for male-to-female and female-to-male (FtM) subjects. Here we used resting-state fMRI to understand the similarities between the spontaneous brain connectivity of an untreated FtM subject and two male and female control groups. Methods: Both seed-voxel and atlas-based region-of-interest (ROI) approaches were used. Results: Brain areas sensitive to gender dimorphism like left lingual gyrus and precuneus showed strong similarities between the FtM subject and female control group with respect to control males, with comparable extension and location of functional connectivity maps. ROI analysis confirmed this evidence, highlighting a greater pattern of differences between the FtM subject and males and the FtM subject and females. No difference between seed-voxel results in the FtM subject and females was found. Conclusion: These data partially support the idea that untreated FtM transgender shows a functional connectivity profile comparable to female control subjects",

    abstract = "Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are characterized by unresponsiveness and convulsions, which cause complete loss of consciousness. Many recent studies have found that the ictal alterations in brain activity of the GTCS epilepsy patients are focally involved in some brain regions, including thalamus, upper brainstem, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior midbrain regions, and lateral parietal cortex. Notably, many of these affected brain regions are the same and overlap considerably with the components of the so-called default mode network (DMN). Here, we hypothesize that the brain activity of the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients are different from normal controls, even in the resting state. To test this hypothesis, we compared the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients and the controls using the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen brain areas in the DMN were extracted, and a complete undirected weighted graph was used to model the DMN for each participant. When directly comparing the edges of the graph, we found significant decreased functional connectivities within the DMN of the GTCS epilepsy patients comparing to the controls. As for the nodes of the graph, we found that the degree of some brain areas within the DMN was significantly reduced in the GTCS epilepsy patients, including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral superior frontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Then we investigated into possible mechanisms of how GTCS epilepsy could cause the reduction of the functional integrations of DMN. We suggested the damaged functional integrations of the DMN in the GTCS epilepsy patients even during the resting state, which could help to understand the neural correlations of the impaired consciousness of GTCS epilepsy patients.",

    abstract = {Resting state fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) acquisitions are characterized by low-frequency spontaneous activity in a default mode network (encompassing medial brain areas and linked to self-related processes) and an anticorrelated "extrinsic" system (encompassing lateral frontoparietal areas and modulated via external sensory stimulation). In order to better determine the functional contribution of these networks to conscious awareness, we here sought to transiently modulate their relationship by means of hypnosis. We used independent component analysis (ICA) on resting state fMRI acquisitions during normal wakefulness, under hypnotic state, and during a control condition of autobiographical mental imagery. As compared to mental imagery, hypnosis-induced modulation of resting state fMRI networks resulted in a reduced "extrinsic" lateral frontoparietal cortical connectivity, possibly reflecting a decreased sensory awareness. The default mode network showed an increased connectivity in bilateral angular and middle frontal gyri, whereas its posterior midline and parahippocampal structures decreased their connectivity during hypnosis, supposedly related to an altered "self" awareness and posthypnotic amnesia. In our view, fMRI resting state studies of physiological (e.g., sleep or hypnosis), pharmacological (e.g., sedation or anesthesia), and pathological modulation (e.g., coma or related states) of "intrinsic" default mode and anticorrelated "extrinsic" sensory networks, and their interaction with other cerebral networks, will further improve our understanding of the neural correlates of subjective awareness.},

    abstract = "The default mode network (DMN) has been consistently activated across a wide variety of self-related tasks, leading to a proposal of the DMN's role in self-related processing. Indeed, there is limited fMRI evidence that the functional connectivity within the DMN may underlie a phenomenon referred to as self-awareness. At the same time, none of the known studies have explicitly investigated neuronal functional interactions among brain areas that comprise the DMN as a function of self-consciousness loss. To fill this gap, EEG operational synchrony analysis [1, 2] was performed in patients with severe brain injuries in vegetative and minimally conscious states to study the strength of DMN operational synchrony as a function of self-consciousness expression. We demonstrated that the strength of DMN EEG operational synchrony was smallest or even absent in patients in vegetative state, intermediate in patients in minimally conscious state and highest in healthy fully self-conscious subjects. At the same time the process of ecoupling of operations performed by neuronal assemblies that comprise the DMN was highest in patients in vegetative state, intermediate in patients in minimally conscious state and minimal in healthy fully self-conscious subjects. The DMN's frontal EEG operational module had the strongest decrease in operational synchrony strength as a function of selfconsciousness loss, when compared with the DMN's posterior modules. Based on these results it is suggested that the strength of DMN functional connectivity could mediate the strength of self-consciousness expression. The observed alterations similarly occurred across EEG alpha, beta1 and beta2 frequency oscillations. Presented results suggest that the EEG operational synchrony within DMN may provide an objective and accurate measure for the assessment of signs of self-(un)consciousness in these challenging patient populations. This method therefore, may complement the current diagnostic procedures for patients with severe brain injuries and, hence, the planning of a rational rehabilitation intervention",

    abstract = "Purpose: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a malformation of cortical development associated with epilepsy and dyslexia. Evidence suggests that heterotopic gray matter can be functional in brain malformations and that connectivity abnormalities may be important in these disorders. We hypothesized that nodular heterotopia develop abnormal connections and systematically investigated the structural and functional connectivity of heterotopia in patients with PNH. Methods: Eleven patients were studied using diffusion tensor tractography and resting-state functional connectivity MRI with bold oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging. Fiber tracks with a terminus within heterotopic nodules were visualized to determine structural connectivity, and brain regions demonstrating resting-state functional correlations to heterotopic nodules were analyzed. Relationships between these connectivity results and measures of clinical epilepsy and cognitive disability were examined. Key Findings: A majority of heterotopia (69\%) showed structural connectivity to discrete regions of overlying cortex, and almost all (96\%) showed functional connectivity to these regions (mean peak correlation coefficient 0.61). Heterotopia also demonstrated connectivity to regions of contralateral cortex, other heterotopic nodules, ipsilateral but nonoverlying cortex, and deep gray matter structures or the cerebellum. Patients with the longest durations of epilepsy had a higher degree of abnormal functional connectivity (p = 0.036). Significance: Most heterotopic nodules in PNH are structurally and functionally connected to overlying cortex, and the strength of abnormal connectivity is higher among patients with the longest duration of epilepsy. Along with prior evidence that cortico-cortical tract defects underlie dyslexia in this disorder, the current findings suggest that altered connectivity is likely a critical substrate for neurologic dysfunction in brain malformations",

In this paper, we introduce an automatic classification framework based on brain imaging features of ADHD patients and present in detail the feature extraction, feature selection, and classifier training methods. The effects of using different features are compared against each other. In addition, we integrate multimodal image features using multi-kernel learning (MKL).

Operating under the hypothesis that the brain's control systems may be impaired in TS, we measured resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) between 39 previously defined putative control regions in 33 adolescents with TS. We were particularly interested in the effect of TS on two of the brain's task control networks-a fronto-parietal network likely involved in more rapid, adaptive online control, and a cingulo-opercular network apparently important for set-maintenance. To examine the relative maturity of connections in the Tourette subjects, functional connections that changed significantly over typical development were examined. Age curves were created for each functional connection charting correlation coefficients over age for 210 healthy people aged 7-31 years, and the TS group correlation coefficients were compared to these curves. Many of these connections were significantly less 'mature' than expected in the TS group. This immaturity was true not only for functional connections that grow stronger with age, but also for those that diminish in strength with age. To explore other differences between Tourette and typically developing subjects further, we performed a second analysis in which the TS group was directly compared to an age-matched, movement-matched group of typically developing, unaffected adolescents. A number of functional connections were found to differ between the two groups. For these identified connections, a large number of connectional differences were found where the TS group value was out of range compared to typical developmental age curves. These anomalous connections were primarily found in the fronto-parietal network, thought to be important for online adaptive control. These results suggest that in adolescents with TS, immature functional connectivity is widespread, with additional, more profound deviation of connectivity in regions related to adaptive online control.",

It is now widely held that such task-induced deactivations index a highly organized 'default-mode network' (DMN): a large-scale brain system whose discovery has had broad implications in the study of human brain function and behavior. In this work, we show that common task-induced deactivations from rest also occur outside of the DMN as a function of increased task demand. Fifty healthy adult subjects performed two distinct functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks that were designed to reliably map deactivations from a resting baseline. As primary findings, increases in task demand consistently modulated the regional anatomy of DMN deactivation. At high levels of task demand, robust deactivation was observed in non-DMN regions, most notably, the posterior insular cortex. Deactivation of this region was directly implicated in a performance-based analysis of experienced task difficulty. Together, these findings suggest that task-induced deactivations from rest are not limited to the DMN and extend to brain regions typically associated with integrative sensory and interoceptive processes",

Functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and limbic regions including the ventral striatum, extended amygdala and parahippocampal areas has been previously implicated in the genetics and clinical severity of smoking. In this study, we test the hypothesis that dACC functional circuits are key paths for the high risk of smoking comorbidity in schizophrenia. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed using the dACC as a seed region in smoking and nonsmoking patients with schizophrenia (n = 54), matched controls (n = 65), and nonpsychotic first-degree relatives (n = 24). Multiple regions had decreased connectivity with the dACC in schizophrenia patients when compared with matched controls (n = 65). Several of these functional circuits were also associated with nicotine addiction severity; the largest cluster included limbic areas such as the parahippocampal, extended amygdala, ventral striatal, and posterior insula regions, indicating an overlap of schizophrenia and nicotine addiction on to this circuit. These same functional connectivity-defined circuits were also significantly impaired in schizophrenia nonsmokers compared with control nonsmokers and in nonpsychotic first-degree relatives. Functional connectivity between the dACC and limbic regions is inherently abnormal in schizophrenia, related to its genetic liability regardless of smoking, and overlaps with a nicotine addiction-related circuit.

    abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The objective was to examine functional connectivity linked to the auditory system in patients with bothersome tinnitus. Activity was low frequency (<0.1 Hz), spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses at rest. The question was whether the experience of chronic bothersome tinnitus induced changes in synaptic efficacy between co-activated components. Functional connectivity for seed regions in auditory, visual, attention, and control networks was computed across all 2mm cubic brain volumes in 17 patients with moderate-severe bothersome tinnitus (Tinnitus Handicap Index: average 53.5 +/- 3.6 (range 38-76)) and 17 age-matched controls. RESULTS: In bothersome tinnitus, negative correlations reciprocally characterized functional connectivity between auditory and occipital/visual cortex. Negative correlations indicate that when BOLD response magnitudes increased in auditory or visual cortex they decreased in the linked visual or auditory cortex, suggesting reciprocally phase reversed activity between functionally connected locations in tinnitus. Both groups showed similar connectivity with positive correlations within the auditory network. Connectivity for primary visual cortex in tinnitus included extensive negative correlations in the ventral attention temporoparietal junction and in the inferior frontal gyrus and rostral insula - executive control network components. Rostral insula and inferior frontal gyrus connectivity in tinnitus also showed greater negative correlations in occipital cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that in bothersome tinnitus there is dissociation between activity in auditory cortex and visual, attention and control networks. The reciprocal negative correlations in connectivity between these networks might be maladaptive or reflect adaptations to reduce phantom noise salience and conflict with attention to non-auditory tasks",

Many previous neuroimaging studies have associated HA scores with the structural and functional organization of the amygdala, but none of these studies have evaluated the correlation between HA score and amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Moreover, the amygdala is not a homogeneous structure, and it has been divided into several structurally and functionally distinct subregions. Investigating the associations between HA score and properties of subregions of the amygdala could greatly improve our understanding of HA. In the present study, using a large sample of 291 healthy young adults, we aimed to uncover correlations between HA scores and the rsFCs of each amygdala subregion and to uncover possible sex-based differences in these correlations. We found that subregions of the amygdala showed different rsFC patterns, which contributed differently to individual HA scores. More specifically, HA scores were correlated with rsFCs between the laterobasal amygdala subregion and temporal and occipital cortices related to emotional information input, between the centromedial subregion and the frontal cortices associated with emotional output control, and between the superficial subregion and the frontal and temporal areas involved in both functions. Moreover, significant gender-based differences were uncovered in these correlations. Our findings provide a more detailed model of association between HA scores and amygdala rsFC, extend our understanding of the connectivity of subregions of the amygdala, and confirm sex-based differences in HA associations",

Clustering schemes based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data are rapidly emerging as non-invasive alternatives to cytoarchitectonic mapping in postmortem brains. Here, we propose a novel spatio-temporal probabilistic parcellation scheme that overcomes major weaknesses of existing approaches by (i) modeling the fMRI time series of a voxel as a von Mises-Fisher distribution, which is widely used for clustering high dimensional data; (ii) modeling the latent cluster labels as a Markov random field, which provides spatial regularization on the cluster labels by penalizing neighboring voxels having different cluster labels; and (iii) introducing a prior on the number of labels, which helps in uncovering the number of clusters automatically from the data. Cluster labels and model parameters are estimated by an iterative expectation maximization procedure wherein, given the data and current estimates of model parameters, the latent cluster labels, are computed using $\alpha$-expansion, a state of the art graph cut, method. In turn, given the current estimates of cluster labels, model parameters are estimated by maximizing the pseudo log-likelihood. The performance of the proposed method is validated using extensive computer simulations. Using novel stability analysis we examine the sensitivity of our methods to parameter initialization and demonstrate that the method is robust to a wide range of initial parameter values. We demonstrate the application of our methods by parcellating spatially contiguous as well as non-contiguous brain regions at both the individual participant and group levels. Notably, our analyses yield new data on the posterior boundaries of the supplementary motor area and provide new insights into functional organization of the insular cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that our method is a powerful tool for investigating functional subdivisions in the human brain",

The sensitivity to noise, that is, signal variations of non-BOLD origin, was investigated for two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques. Incomplete relaxation between subsequent scans increases the level of temporally and spatially correlated signal variations originating from physiological and/or systemic noise. Although inflow effects are suspected to be reduced in 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI) compared with multi-slice 2D EPI, the noise level was higher in the 3D technique. The noise level in 3D fMRI experiments was significantly increased by instabilities of the transverse steady-state magnetization as the repetition time was of the order of T(2). By implementing radiofrequency spoiling, temporal signal fluctuations and erroneous inter-regional correlation in connectivity maps were diminished to a level present in data sets acquired with 2D EPI.",

Resting-state fMRI scans were performed before EA, and at 5 and 15 min after needle removal. Statistical parametric mapping was used to preprocess initial data, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) were analysed.Results ReHo at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the left temporal lobe and cerebellum and decreases in the left parietal lobe, occipital lobe and right precuneus. At 15 min post stimulation, ReHo showed increases in the left fusiform gyrus; lingual gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; postcentral gyrus; limbic lobe; cingulate gyrus; paracentral lobule; cerebellum, posterior lobe, declive; right cuneus and cerebellum, anterior lobe, culmen. It also showed decreases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, right temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe and right cingulate gyrus. ALFF at 5 min post stimulation showed increases in the right temporal lobe, but decreases in the right limbic lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus. At 15 min post stimulation ALFF showed increases in the left frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, right temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and cerebellum, but decreases in the left frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus, right frontal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus.Conclusions After EA stimulation at Yintang and GV20, which are associated with psychiatric disorder treatments, changes were localised in the frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus and cerebellum. Changes were higher in number and intensity at 15 min than at 5 min after needle removal, demonstrating lasting and strong after-effects of EA on cerebral functional regions",

    abstract = {It is difficult to study the brain "at rest" with an approach generally pursued in science when external manipulation (independent variable) is used to obtain informative measurements (dependent variable) about the object of interest. External manipulation in its classic sense may suspend the resting state, and hence the object of interest will evade. Naturally, unless in a final and irreversible state, biological rest will always be an endogenously dynamic process. Combining two modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to simultaneously measure the brain's activity from two angles, one can be chosen to be interpreted as the independent variable and the other as the dependent variable, and without external manipulation the brain's spontaneous dynamics can be studied. The EEG, for example, observes endogenous modulations of vigilance and detects spontaneous events such as sleep spindles or epileptic discharges and can be used as the independent variable, i.e., to form a regressor to interrogate the fMRI data (dependent variable). The opposite is possible as well, and data fusion attempts try using all data both as dependent and independent variables at the same time. This review limits itself to an exemplary discussion of simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies in humans, and among a variety of proposed resting state networks only discusses a few, especially those for which non-resting state literature has proposed a functional meaning: the "default mode" network and an attentional network. It will be shown that one EEG feature can correlate with different fMRI activation maps and that a single resting state network may be associated with a variety of EEG patterns giving insight into the function of different resting states and the relationship between the two modalities in themselves},

    abstract = {Most studies of resting-state functional connectivity using fMRI employ methods that assume temporal stationarity, such as correlation and data-driven decompositions computed across the duration of the scan. However, evidence from both task-based fMRI studies and animal electrophysiology suggests that functional connectivity may exhibit dynamic changes within time scales of seconds to minutes. In the present study, we investigated the dynamic behavior of resting-state connectivity across the course of a single scan, performing a time-frequency coherence analysis based on the wavelet transform. We focused on the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a primary node of the default-mode network, examining its relationship with both the "anticorrelated" ("task-positive") network as well as other nodes of the default-mode network. It was observed that coherence and phase between the PCC and the anticorrelated network was variable in time and frequency, and statistical testing based on Monte Carlo simulations revealed the presence of significant scale-dependent temporal variability. In addition, a sliding-window correlation procedure identified other regions across the brain that exhibited variable connectivity with the PCC across the scan, which included areas previously implicated in attention and salience processing. Although it is unclear whether the observed coherence and phase variability can be attributed to residual noise or modulation of cognitive state, the present results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static, and it may therefore prove valuable to consider measures of variability, in addition to average quantities, when characterizing resting-state networks.},

The aim of this study was to use functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to test the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with functional disconnection within the CON. Thirty subjects with schizophrenia and thirty healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Each subject received resting fMRI scanning, clinical evaluations and cognitive examinations. The CON of each subject was derived by calculating the functional connectivity map of a seed in the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). A between-group comparison was performed using a random effect analysis. Further network analyses with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) were performed to characterize the pattern of functional disconnection within the entire CON. Using the dACC seed in healthy controls, we derived the CON, which includes the following anatomical structures: the dACC; the bilateral anterior prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior insular cortices; the putamen; the thalamus; and the cerebellum. Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenic patients showed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the bilateral putamens. Further network analysis demonstrated widespread cortico-striatal disconnection within the CON of schizophrenic patients. The disconnections correlated with negative symptom severity. Behavioral regression revealed that cortico-striatal functional connectivity predicted 2-back working memory performance in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenic patients. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with cortical-striatal disconnection within the CON.

However, the neural correlates of the resting-state DMN and MDD-related pathopsychological characteristics, such as depressive rumination and overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM) phenomena, still remain unclear.METHODS: Using independent component analysis, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from 35 first-episode, treatment-naive young adults with MDD and from 35 matched healthy control subjects.RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited higher levels of rumination and OGM than did the control subjects. We observed increased functional connectivity in the anterior medial cortex regions (especially the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior medial cortex regions (especially the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus) in MDD patients compared with control subjects. In the depressed group, the increased functional connectivity in the anterior medial cortex correlated positively with rumination score, while the decreased functional connectivity in the posterior medial cortex correlated negatively with OGM score.CONCLUSIONS: We report dissociation between anterior and posterior functional connectivity in resting-state DMNs of first-episode, treatment-naive young adults with MDD. Increased functional connectivity in anterior medial regions of the resting-state DMN was associated with rumination, whereas decreased functional connectivity in posterior medial regions was associated with OGM. These results provide new evidence for the importance of the DMN in the pathophysiology of MDD and suggest that abnormal DMN activity may be an MDD trait",

However, in contrast to connectivity analyses based on task-evoked signal changes, selecting the optimal spatial location of the regions of interest (ROIs) whose timecourses will be extracted and used in subsequent analyses is not straightforward. Moreover, it is also unknown how different choices of the precise anatomical locations within given brain regions influence the estimates of functional connectivity under steady-state conditions. The objective of the present study was to assess the variability in estimates of functional connectivity induced by different anatomical choices of ROI locations for a given brain network. We here targeted the default mode network (DMN) sampled during both resting-state and a continuous verbal 2-back working memory task to compare four different methods to extract ROIs in terms of ROI features (spatial overlap, spatial functional heterogeneity), signal features (signal distribution, mean, variance, correlation) as well as strength of functional connectivity as a function of condition. We show that, while different ROI selection methods produced quantitatively different results, all tested ROI selection methods agreed on the final conclusion that functional connectivity within the DMN decreased during the continuous working memory task compared to rest.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Models of cocaine addiction emphasize the role of disrupted frontal circuitry supporting cognitive control processes. However, addiction-related alterations in functional interactions among brain regions, especially between the cerebral hemispheres, are rarely examined directly. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approaches, which reveal patterns of coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal, offer a means to quantify directly functional interactions between the hemispheres. We examined interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in cocaine dependence using a recently validated approach, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity. METHODS: We compared interhemispheric RSFC between 25 adults (aged 35.0 ± 8.8) meeting DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence within the past 12 months but currently abstaining (>2 weeks) from cocaine and 24 healthy comparisons (35.1 ± 7.5), group-matched on age, sex, education, and employment status. RESULTS: We observed reduced prefrontal interhemispheric RSFC in cocaine-dependent participants relative to control subjects. Further analyses demonstrated a striking cocaine-dependence-related reduction in interhemispheric RSFC among nodes of the dorsal attention network, comprising bilateral lateral frontal, medial premotor, and posterior parietal areas. Further, within the cocaine-dependent group, RSFC within the dorsal attention network was associated with self-reported attentional lapses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide further evidence of an association between chronic exposure to cocaine and disruptions within large-scale brain circuitry supporting cognitive control. We did not detect group differences in diffusion tensor imaging measures, suggesting that alterations in the brain's functional architecture associated with cocaine exposure can be observed in the absence of detectable abnormalities in the white matter microstructure supporting that architecture.",

Using one-way analysis of variance, we found significant gray matter abnormalities in the right middle temporal cortex (MTG) and bilateral caudate among the TRD, TSD and healthy controls. For the FC of the right MTG, we found that both the patients with TRD and TSD showed altered connectivity mainly in the default-mode network (DMN).

Our results revealed the gray matter reduction of right MTG and bilateral caudate, and disrupted functional connection to widely distributed circuitry in DMN and frontal regions, respectively.

However, despite its prominence, the lifespan development of the homotopic resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the human brain is rarely directly examined in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Here, we systematically investigated age-related changes in homotopic RSFC in 214 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. We observed marked age-related changes in homotopic RSFC with regionally specific developmental trajectories of varying levels of complexity. Sensorimotor regions tended to show increasing homotopic RSFC, whereas higher-order processing regions showed decreasing connectivity (i.e., increasing segregation) with age. More complex maturational curves were also detected, with regions such as the insula and lingual gyrus exhibiting quadratic trajectories and the superior frontal gyrus and putamen exhibiting cubic trajectories. Sex-related differences in the developmental trajectory of functional homotopy were detected within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 9 and 46) and amygdala. Evidence of robust developmental effects in homotopic RSFC across the lifespan should serve to motivate studies of the physiological mechanisms underlying functional homotopy in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",

We present cognitive network abnormalities in a group of patients at a presymptomatic stage.METHODS: Seventeen patients with ≥70\% asymptomatic stenosis of unilateral internal carotid artery were compared with 26 healthy controls utilizing a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, the dizziness handicap inventory, and multimodality neuroimaging including diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. Longitudinally, assessments were completed in a subgroup of 10 patients at 3 months after carotid artery stenting.RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients had worse dizziness scores, poorer memory, complex visuo-spatial performances, and lower whole-brain mean fractional anisotropy. The Scheltens scores of leukoaraiosis/infarction were not different between groups. Their seed-based functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging showed marked decrements of interhemispheric and intrahemispheric, ipsilaterally to carotid stenosis, functional connectivity in the frontoparietal network. In the default mode network, the intrahemispheric functional connectivity was bilaterally impaired. Importantly, the disrupted mean fractional anisotropy in the patients significantly correlated with the attention and verbal memory functions. After successful carotid artery stenting, small but measurable increments of the mean fractional anisotropy and little functional connectivity in the default mode network ipsilateral-to-carotid artery stenting were noted.CONCLUSIONS: We identified for the first time distinct patterns of network disruption that correlate with cognitive fragility in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

Previous neuroimaging studies of resting state have revealed reduced task-related deactivation of this network in autism. We investigated the DMN in 13 high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 14 typically developing control participants during three fMRI studies (two language tasks and a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task). Each study had separate blocks of fixation/resting baseline. The data from the task blocks and fixation blocks were collated to examine deactivation and functional connectivity. Deficits in the deactivation of the DMN in individuals with ASD were specific only to the ToM task, with no group differences in deactivation during the language tasks or a combined language and self-other discrimination task. During rest blocks following the ToM task, the ASD group showed less deactivation than the control group in a number of DMN regions, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus. In addition, we found weaker functional connectivity of the MPFC in individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, we were able to reliably classify participants into ASD or typically developing control groups based on both the whole-brain and seed-based connectivity patterns with accuracy up to 96.3\%. These findings indicate that deactivation and connectivity of the DMN were altered in individuals with ASD. In addition, these findings suggest that the deficits in DMN connectivity could be a neural signature that can be used for classifying an individual as belonging to the ASD group",

In this study, we systematically calculated a large set of standard and new quantitative markers from individual subject datasets. These features (>12,000 per subject) consisted of local anatomical attributes such as cortical thickness and structure volumes, and both local and global resting-state network measures. Three methods were used to compute graphs representing interdependencies between activations in different brain areas, and a full set of network features was derived from each. Of these, features derived from the inverse of the time series covariance matrix, under an L1-norm regularization penalty, proved most powerful. Anatomical and network feature sets were used individually, and combined with non-imaging phenotypic features from each subject. Machine learning algorithms were used to rank attributes, and performance was assessed under cross-validation and on a separate test set of 168 subjects for a variety of feature set combinations. While non-imaging features gave highest performance in cross-validation, the addition of imaging features in sufficient numbers led to improved generalization to new data. Stratification by gender also proved to be a fruitful strategy to improve classifier performance. We describe the overall approach used, compare the predictive power of different classes of features, and describe the most impactful features in relation to the current literature",

    abstract = "Resting-state, low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance signal have been shown to exhibit high correlation among functionally connected regions. However, correlations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) fluctuations during the resting state have not been extensively studied. The main challenges of using arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging to detect CBF fluctuations are low sensitivity, low temporal resolution, and contamination from BOLD. This work demonstrates CBF-based quantitative functional connectivity mapping by combining continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) with a neck labeling coil and a multi-channel receiver coil to achieve high perfusion sensitivity. In order to reduce BOLD contamination, the CBF signal was extracted from the CASL signal time course by high frequency filtering. This processing strategy is compatible with sinc interpolation for reducing the timing mismatch between control and label images and has the flexibility of choosing an optimal filter cutoff frequency to minimize BOLD fluctuations. Most subjects studied showed high CBF correlation in bilateral sensorimotor areas with good suppression of BOLD contamination. Root-mean-square CBF fluctuation contributing to bilateral correlation was estimated to be 29+/-19\% (N=13) of the baseline perfusion, while BOLD fluctuation was 0.26+/-0.14\% of the mean intensity (at 3 T and 12.5 ms echo time)",

Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been adopted as a pivotal biomarker in rs-fNIRS studies. However, it is yet to be clear if the RSFC derived from rs-fNIRS is reliable. This concern impedes extensive utilization of rs-fNIRS. We systematically address the issue of reliability. Sixteen subjects participate in two rs-fNIRS sessions held one week apart. RSFC in sensorimotor system is calculated using the seed-correlation approach. Then, test-retest reliability is evaluated at three different scales (map-, cluster-, and channelwise) for individual- and group-level RSFC derived from different types of fNIRS signals [oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR), and total hemoglobin (HbT)]. The results show that, for HbO signals, individual-level RSFC generally has good-to-excellent map-/clusterwise reliability, while group-level RSFC has excellent reliability. For HbT signals, the results are similar. For HbR signals, the clusterwise reliability is comparable to that for HbO while the mapwise reliability is slightly lower (fair to good). Focusing on RSFC at a single channel, we report poor channelwise reliability for all three types of signals. We hereby propose that fNIRS-derived RSFC is a reliable biomarker if interpreted in map- and clusterwise manners. However, channelwise interpretation of individual RSFC should proceed with caution.",

Previous fMRI studies were focused on the examination of motor-related areas and little is known about the functional changes in the extra-motor areas in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The aim of this study is to investigate functional cerebral abnormalities in ALS patients on a whole brain scale. Twenty ALS patients and twenty age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Voxel-based analysis was used to characterize the alteration of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). Compared with the controls, the ALS patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in the visual cortex, fusiform gyri and right postcentral gyrus; and significantly increased ALFF in the left medial frontal gyrus, and in right inferior frontal areas after grey matter (GM) correction. Taking GM volume as covariates, the ALFF results were approximately consistent with those without GM correction. In addition, ALFF value in left medial frontal gyrus was negatively correlated with the rate of disease progression and duration. Decreased functional activity observed in the present study indicates the underlying deficits of the sensory processing system in ALS. Increased functional activity points to a compensatory mechanism. Our findings suggest that ALS is a multisystem disease other than merely motor dysfunction and provide evidence that alterations of ALFF in the frontal areas may be a special marker of ALS",

At the core of these two networks are the dorsal attention system and the hippocampal-cortical memory system, a component of the brain's default network. Here spontaneous blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlations were used in three separate functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets (n = 105) to define a third system, the frontoparietal control system, which is spatially interposed between these two previously defined systems. The frontoparietal control system includes many regions identified as supporting cognitive control and decision-making processes including lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Detailed analysis of frontal and parietal cortex, including use of high-resolution data, revealed clear evidence for contiguous but distinct regions: in general, the regions associated with the frontoparietal control system are situated between components of the dorsal attention and hippocampal-cortical memory systems. The frontoparietal control system is therefore anatomically positioned to integrate information from these two opposing brain systems",

Two different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz) were analyzed. We showed that there were widespread differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two bands in many brain regions, predominantly including the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), basal ganglia, and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Compared to controls, the aMCI patients had decreased ALFF/fALFF values in the PCC/PCu, MPFC, hippocampus/PHG, basal ganglia, and prefrontal regions, and increased ALFF/fALFF values mainly in several occipital and temporal regions. Specifically, we observed that the ALFF/fALFF abnormalities in the PCC/PCu, PHG, and several occipital regions were greater in the slow-5 band than in the slow-4 band. Finally, our results of functional analysis were not significantly influenced by the gray matter loss in the MCI patients, suggesting that the results reflect functional differences between groups. Together, our data suggest that aMCI patients have widespread abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity, and the abnormalities depend on the studied frequency bands of R-fMRI data.",

    abstract = {The resting brain exhibits coherent patterns of spontaneous low-frequency BOLD fluctuations. These so-called resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks are posited to reflect intrinsic representations of functional systems commonly implicated in cognitive function. Yet, the direct relationship between RSFC and the BOLD response induced by task performance remains unclear. Here we examine the relationship between a region's pattern of RSFC across participants and that same region's level of BOLD activation during an Eriksen Flanker task. To achieve this goal we employed a voxel-matched regression method, which assessed whether the magnitude of task-induced activity at each brain voxel could be predicted by measures of RSFC strength for the same voxel, across 26 healthy adults. We examined relationships between task-induced activation and RSFC strength for six different seed regions [Fox, M.D., Snyder, A.Z., Vincent, J.L., Corbetta, M., Van Essen, D.C., Raichle, M.E., 2005. The human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anticorrelated functional networks. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102, 9673-9678.], as well as the "default mode" and "task-positive" resting-state networks in their entirety. Our results indicate that, for a number of brain regions, inter-individual differences in task-induced BOLD activity were predicted by one of two resting-state properties: (1) the region's positive connectivity strength with the task-positive network, or (2) its negative connectivity with the default mode network. Strikingly, most of the regions exhibiting a significant relationship between their RSFC properties and task-induced BOLD activity were located in transition zones between the default mode and task-positive networks. These results suggest that a common mechanism governs many brain regions' neural activity during rest and its neural activity during task performance.},

The main obstacle for widespread use of ECM in functional MRI (fMRI) is the cost of computing and storing the connectivity matrix. This paper presents fast ECM (fECM), an efficient algorithm to estimate voxel-wise eigenvector centralities from fMRI time series. Instead of explicitly storing the connectivity matrix, fECM computes matrix-vector products directly from the data, achieving high accelerations for computing voxel-wise centralities in fMRI at standard resolutions for multivariate analyses, and enabling high-resolution analyses performed on standard hardware. We demonstrate the validity of fECM at cluster and voxel levels, using synthetic and in vivo data. Results from synthetic data are compared to the theoretical 'gold standard', and local centrality changes in fMRI data are measured after experimental intervention. A simple scheme is presented to generate time series with prescribed covariances that represent a connectivity matrix. These time series are used to construct a 4D data set, whose volumes consist of separate regions with known intra- and interregional connectivities. The fECM method is tested and validated on these synthetic data. Resting-state fMRI data acquired after real vs. sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show fECM connectivity changes in resting-state network regions. A comparison of analyses with and without accounting for motion parameters demonstrates a moderate effect of these parameters on the centrality estimates. Its computational speed and statistical sensitivity make fECM a good candidate for connectivity analyses of multi-modality and high-resolution functional neuroimaging data",

RSN reported studies in rodents, however, are few, and most studies are performed with anesthetized rodents that might alter networks and differ from their non-anesthetized state. Acquiring RSN data in the awake rodent avoids the issues of anesthesia effects on brain function. Using high field fMRI we determined RSNs in awake rats using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach, however, ICA analysis can produce a large number of components, some with biological relevance (networks).

    title = "{Why use a connectivity-based approach to study stroke and recovery of function?}",
    abstract = "The brain is organized into a set of widely distributed networks. Therefore, although structural damage from stroke is focal, remote dysfunction can occur in regions connected to the area of lesion. Historically, neuroscience has focused on local processing due in part to the absence of tools to study the function of distributed networks. In this article we discuss how a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of stroke can be attained using resting state functional connectivity BOLD magnetic resonance imaging (resting state fcMRI). Resting state fcMRI has a number of advantages over task-evoked fMRI for studying brain network reorganization in response to stroke, including the ability to image subjects with a broad range of impairments and the ability to study multiple networks simultaneously. We describe our rationale for using resting state connectivity as a tool for investigating the neural substrates of stroke recovery in a heterogeneous population of stroke patients and discuss the main questions we hope to answer, in particular whether resting state fcMRI measures in the acute phase of stroke can predict subsequent recovery. Early results suggest that disruption of inter-hemispheric connectivity in the somatomotor network and the dorsal attention network is more strongly associated with behavioral impairment in those domains than is intra-hemispheric connectivity within either the lesioned or unaffected hemisphere. We also observe in the somatomotor network an interesting interaction between corticospinal tract damage and decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity that suggests that both processes combine to contribute to neuromotor impairment after stroke. A connectivity-based approach will provide greater insight into network reorganization in the acute and chronic phases after stroke and will contribute to improving prognostic ability and the development of therapeutic interventions",

The negative power scaling of the lFCD was steeper for men than for women, suggesting that the balance between strongly and weakly connected nodes in the brain is different across genders.

    abstract = "Both resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) and task-based fMRI (T-fMRI) have been widely used to study the functional activities of the human brain during task-free and task-performance periods, respectively. However, due to the difficulty in strictly controlling the participating subject's mental status and their cognitive behaviors during fMRI scans, it has been very challenging to tell whether or not an R-fMRI/T-fMRI scan truly reflects the participant's functional brain states in task-free/task-performance. This paper presents a novel approach to characterizing the brain's functional status into task-free or task-performance states. The basic idea here is that the brain's functional state is represented by a whole-brain quasi-stable connectivity pattern (WQCP), and an effective sparse coding procedure was then applied to learn the atomic connectivity patterns (ACP) of both task-free and task-performance states based on training R-fMRI and T-fMRI data. Our experimental results demonstrated that the learned ACPs for R-fMRI and T-fMRI datasets are substantially different, as expected. However, a certain portion of ACPs from R-fMRI and T-fMRI datasets are overlapping, suggesting that those subjects with overlapping ACPs were not in the expected task-free/task-performance states during R-fMRI/T-fMRI scans",

This study explores the activity and functional connectivity of these regions during acupuncture vs. tactile stimulation and vs. acupuncture associated with inadvertent sharp pain. Acupuncture during 201 scans and tactile stimulation during 74 scans for comparison at acupoints LI4, ST36 and LV3 was monitored with fMRI and psychophysical response in 48 healthy subjects. Clusters of deactivated regions in the medial prefrontal, medial parietal and medial temporal lobes as well as activated regions in the sensorimotor and a few paralimbic structures can be identified during acupuncture by general linear model analysis and seed-based cross correlation analysis. Importantly, these clusters showed virtual identity with the default mode network and the anti-correlated task-positive network in response to stimulation. In addition, the amygdala and hypothalamus, structures not routinely reported in the default mode literature, were frequently involved in acupuncture. When acupuncture induced sharp pain, the deactivation was attenuated or became activated instead. Tactile stimulation induced greater activation of the somatosensory regions but less extensive deactivation of the LPNN. These results indicate that the deactivation of the LPNN during acupuncture cannot be completely explained by the demand of attention that is commonly proposed in the default mode literature. Our results suggest that acupuncture mobilizes the anti-correlated functional networks of the brain to mediate its actions, and that the effect is dependent on the psychophysical response",

With three converging lines of evidence, we show that a common, functional ASD risk variant in the Met Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (MET) gene is a potent modulator of key social brain circuitry in children and adolescents with and without ASD. MET risk genotype predicted atypical fMRI activation and deactivation patterns to social stimuli (i.e., emotional faces), as well as reduced functional and structural connectivity in temporo-parietal regions known to have high MET expression, particularly within the default mode network. Notably, these effects were more pronounced in individuals with ASD. These findings highlight how genetic stratification may reduce heterogeneity and help elucidate the biological basis of complex neuropsychiatric disorders such as ASD",

    abstract = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in anesthetized-animals is critical in studying the mechanisms of fMRI and investigating animal models of various diseases. Medetomidine was recently introduced for independent anesthesia for longitudinal (survival) fMRI studies in rats. Since stimulation-induced fMRI signal is anesthesia-dependent and its characteristics in rats under medetomidine are not fully elucidated, the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI response to electrical forepaw stimulation under medetomidine was systematically investigated at 9.4 T. Robust activations in contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and thalamus were observed and peaked at the stimulus frequency of 9 Hz. The response in SI saturates at the stimulus strength of 4 mA while that in thalamus monotonically increases. In addition to fMRI data acquired with the forepaw stimulation, data were also acquired during the resting-state to investigate the synchronization of low frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the BOLD signal (<0.08 Hz) in different brain regions. LFF during resting-state have been observed to be synchronized between functionally related brain regions in human subjects while its origin is not fully understood. LFF have not been extensively studied or widely reported in anesthetized-animals. In our data, synchronized LFF of BOLD signals are found in clustered, bilaterally symmetric regions, including SI and caudate-putamen and the magnitude of the LFF is approximately 1.5\%, comparable to the stimulation-induced BOLD signals. Similar to resting-state data reported in human subjects, LFF in rats under medetomidine likely reflect functional connectivity of these brain regions",

    abstract = "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of large-scale brain activity interaction structure from the perspective of complex networks, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. To assess the strength of interaction (functional connectivity, FC) between two brain regions, the linear (Pearson) correlation coefficient of the respective time series is most commonly used. Since a potential use of nonlinear FC measures has recently been discussed in this and other fields, the question arises whether particular nonlinear FC measures would be more informative for the graph analysis than linear ones. We present a comparison of network analysis results obtained from the brain connectivity graphs capturing either full (both linear and nonlinear) or only linear connectivity using 24 sessions of human resting-state fMRI. For each session, a matrix of full connectivity between 90 anatomical parcel time series is computed using mutual information. For comparison, connectivity matrices obtained for multivariate linear Gaussian surrogate data that preserve the correlations, but remove any nonlinearity are generated. Binarizing these matrices using multiple thresholds, we generate graphs corresponding to linear and full nonlinear interaction structures. The effect of neglecting nonlinearity is then assessed by comparing the values of a range of graph-theoretical measures evaluated for both types of graphs. Statistical comparisons suggest a potential effect of nonlinearity on the local measures-clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality. Nevertheless, subsequent quantitative comparison shows that the nonlinearity effect is practically negligible when compared to the intersubject variability of the graph measures. Further, on the group-average graph level, the nonlinearity effect is unnoticeable.",

The anatomical connectivity of these areas with parietal and temporal cortical regions was recently examined in an autoradiographic tract-tracing study in the macaque monkey. Studies suggest strong correspondence between human resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data and experimentally demonstrated anatomical connections in non-human primates. Accordingly, we hypothesized that areas 6, 44 and 45 of the human brain would exhibit patterns of RSFC consistent with patterns of anatomical connectivity observed in the macaque. In a primary analysis, we examined the RSFC associated with regions-of-interest placed in ventrolateral frontal areas 6, 44 and 45, on the basis of local sulcal and gyral anatomy. We validated the results of the primary hypothesis-driven analysis with a data-driven partitioning of ventrolateral frontal cortex into regions exhibiting distinct RSFC patterns, using a spectral clustering algorithm. The RSFC of ventrolateral frontal areas 6, 44 and 45 was consistent with patterns of anatomical connectivity shown in the macaque. We observed a striking dissociation between RSFC for the ventral part of area 6 that is involved in orofacial motor control and RSFC associated with Broca's region (areas 44 and 45). These findings indicate rich and differential RSFC patterns for the ventrolateral frontal areas controlling language production, consistent with known anatomical connectivity in the macaque brain, and suggest conservation of connectivity during the evolution of the primate brain.",

    abstract = "The human insula is hidden in the depth of the cerebral hemisphere by the overlying frontal and temporal opercula, and consists of three cytoarchitectonically distinct regions: the anterior agranular area, posterior granular area, and the transitional dysgranular zone; each has distinct histochemical staining patterns and specific connectivity. Even though there are several studies reporting the functional connectivity of the insula with the cingulated cortex, its relationships with other brain areas remain elusive in humans. Therefore, we decided to use resting state functional connectivity to elucidate in details its connectivity, in terms of cortical and subcortical areas, and also of lateralization. We investigated correlations in BOLD fluctuations between specific regions of interest of the insula and other brain areas of right-handed healthy volunteers, on both sides of the brain. Our findings document two major complementary networks involving the ventral-anterior and dorsal-posterior insula: one network links the anterior insula to the middle and inferior temporal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, and is primarily related to limbic regions which play a role in emotional aspects; the second links the middle-posterior insula to premotor, sensorimotor, supplementary motor and middle-posterior cingulate cortices, indicating a role for the insula in sensorimotor integration. The clear bipartition of the insula was confirmed by negative correlation analysis. Correlation maps are partially lateralized: the salience network, related to the ventral anterior insula, displays stronger connections with the anterior cingulate cortex on the right side, and with the frontal cortex on the left side; the posterior network has stronger connections with the superior temporal cortex and the occipital cortex on the right side. These results are in agreement with connectivity studies in primates, and support the use of resting state functional analysis to investigate connectivity in the living human brain.",

The interpretation of the BOLD signal as a measure of medial temporal lobe function can be complicated, however, by changes in the cerebrovascular system that can occur with both normal aging and age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Quantitative measures of the functional cerebral blood flow (CBF) response offer a useful complement to BOLD measures and have been shown to aid in the interpretation of fMRI studies. Despite these potential advantages, the application of ASL to fMRI studies of cognitive tasks and at-risk populations has been limited. In this study, we demonstrate the application of ASL fMRI to obtain measures of the CBF and BOLD responses to the encoding of natural scenes in healthy young (mean 25 years) and elderly (mean 74 years) adults. The percent CBF increase in the medial temporal lobe was significantly higher in the older adults, whereas the CBF levels during baseline and task conditions and during a separate resting-state scan were significantly lower in the older group. The older adults also showed slightly higher values for the BOLD response amplitude and the absolute change in CBF, but the age group differences were not significant. The percent CBF and BOLD responses are consistent with an age-related increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO(2)) response to memory encoding.",

    abstract = "In this paper, a high-dimensional pattern classification framework, based on functional associations between brain regions during resting-state, is proposed to accurately identify MCI individuals from subjects who experience normal aging. The proposed technique employs multi-spectrum networks to characterize the complex yet subtle blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes caused by pathological attacks. The utilization of multi-spectrum networks in identifying MCI individuals is motivated by the inherent frequency-specific properties of BOLD spectrum. It is believed that frequency specific information extracted from different spectra may delineate the complex yet subtle variations of BOLD signals more effectively. In the proposed technique, regional mean time series of each region-of-interest (ROI) is band-pass filtered (0.025 ≤ ƒ ≤ 0.100 Hz) before it is decomposed into five frequency sub-bands. Five connectivity networks are constructed, one from each frequency sub-band. Clustering coefficient of each ROI in relation to the other ROIs are extracted as features for classification. Classification accuracy was evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure generalization of performance. The classification accuracy obtained by this approach is 86.5\%, which is an increase of at least 18.9\% from the conventional full-spectrum methods. A cross-validation estimation of the generalization performance shows an area of 0.863 under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, indicating good diagnostic power. It was also found that, based on the selected features, portions of the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe regions provided the most discriminant information for classification, in line with results reported in previous studies. Analysis on individual frequency sub-bands demonstrated that different sub-bands contribute differently to classification, providing extra evidence regarding frequency-specific distribution of BOLD signals. Our MCI classification framework, which allows accurate early detection of functional brain abnormalities, makes an important positive contribution to the treatment management of potential AD patients",

Functional MRI findings from the literature are complemented by our own meta-analysis of fMRI studies on sex-specific differences in human emotional processing. Specifically, we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to provide a quantitative approach to mapping the consistency of neural networks involved in emotional processing across studies.

We note that undirected graphs representing conditional independence between multivariate time-series can be more readily approached in the frequency domain than the time domain. Estimators of partial coherency and normalized partial mutual information phi, an integrated measure of partial coherence over an arbitrary frequency band, are applied. Using these tools, we replicate the prior observations that bilaterally homologous brain regions tend to be strongly connected and functional connectivity is generally greater at low frequencies [0.0004, 0.1518 Hz]. We also show that long-distance intrahemispheric connections between regions of prefrontal and parietal cortex were more salient at low frequencies than at frequencies greater than 0.3 Hz, whereas many local or short-distance connections, such as those comprising segregated dorsal and ventral paths in posterior cortex, were also represented in the graph of high-frequency connectivity. We conclude that the partial coherency spectrum between a pair of human brain regional fMRI time-series depends on the anatomical distance between regions: long-distance (greater than 7 cm) edges represent conditional dependence between bilaterally symmetric neocortical regions, and between regions of prefrontal and parietal association cortex in the same hemisphere, are predominantly subtended by low-frequency components.",

    abstract = "Resting-state or intrinsic connectivity network functional magnetic resonance imaging provides a new tool for mapping large-scale neural network function and dysfunction. Recently, we showed that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease cause atrophy within two major networks, an anterior 'Salience Network' (atrophied in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia) and a posterior 'Default Mode Network' (atrophied in Alzheimer's disease). These networks exhibit an anti-correlated relationship with each other in the healthy brain. The two diseases also feature divergent symptom-deficit profiles, with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia undermining social-emotional function and preserving or enhancing visuospatial skills, and Alzheimer's disease showing the inverse pattern. We hypothesized that these disorders would exert opposing connectivity effects within the Salience Network (disrupted in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia but enhanced in Alzheimer's disease) and the Default Mode Network (disrupted in Alzheimer's disease but enhanced in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia). With task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested these ideas in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and healthy age-matched controls (n = 12 per group), using independent component analyses to generate group-level network contrasts. As predicted, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia attenuated Salience Network connectivity, most notably in frontoinsular, cingulate, striatal, thalamic and brainstem nodes, but enhanced connectivity within the Default Mode Network. Alzheimer's disease, in contrast, reduced Default Mode Network connectivity to posterior hippocampus, medial cingulo-parieto-occipital regions and the dorsal raphe nucleus, but intensified Salience Network connectivity. Specific regions of connectivity disruption within each targeted network predicted intrinsic connectivity enhancement within the reciprocal network. In behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, clinical severity correlated with loss of right frontoinsular Salience Network connectivity and with biparietal Default Mode Network connectivity enhancement. Based on these results, we explored whether a combined index of Salience Network and Default Mode Network connectivity might discriminate between the three groups. Linear discriminant analysis achieved 92\% clinical classification accuracy, including 100\% separation of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Patients whose clinical diagnoses were supported by molecular imaging, genetics, or pathology showed 100\% separation using this method, including four diagnostically equivocal 'test' patients not used to train the algorithm. Overall, the findings suggest that behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease lead to divergent network connectivity patterns, consistent with known reciprocal network interactions and the strength and deficit profiles of the two disorders. Further developed, intrinsic connectivity network signatures may provide simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive biomarkers for dementia differential diagnosis and disease monitoring.",

    abstract = "Schizophrenia has been associated with abnormal task-related brain activation in sensory and motor regions as well as social cognition network. Recently, two studies investigated temporal correlation between resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in schizophrenia but reported mixed results. This may be due to the different frequency bands used in these studies. Here we utilized R-fMRI to measure the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in three different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz; and typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy controls. We showed that there were significant differences in ALFF/fALFF between the two bands (slow-5 and slow-4) in regions including basal ganglia, midbrain, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, we also identified significant interaction between frequency bands and groups in inferior occipital gyrus, precunus, and thalamus. The results suggest that the abnormalities of LFOs in schizophrenia is dependent on the frequency band and suggest that future studies should take the different frequency bands into account when measure intrinsic brain activity.

This model used the correlation/anti-correlation coefficients of two intrinsically anti-correlated networks in resting brains, which have been suggested by two recent studies, as the feature of classification. Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminative Analysis (pFLDA) was then performed on the feature space and a linear classifier was generated. Using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation, our results showed a correct classification rate of 83\%. We also compared the proposed model with another one based on the whole brain functional connectivity. Our proposed model outperformed the other one significantly, and this implied that the two intrinsically anti-correlated networks may be a more susceptible part of the whole brain network in the early stage of AD.",

    abstract = {Disturbances in the default mode network (DMN) have been described in many neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD). The DMN is characterized by basal activity that increases during rest or passive visual fixation and decreases ("deactivates") during cognitive tasks. The network is believed to be involved in cognitive processes. We examined the DMN in PD patients on dopaminergic medication with normal cognitive performance compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) using fMRI and three methodological procedures: independent component analysis of resting-state data, analysis of deactivation during a complex visual scene-encoding task, and seed-based functional connectivity analysis. In the PD group, we also studied the effect of dopaminergic medication on the DMN integrity. We did not find any difference between the PD and HC groups in the DMN, but using the daily levodopa equivalent dose as a covariate, we observed an enhanced functional connectivity of the DMN in the posterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus during the cognitive task. We conclude that dopaminergic therapy has a specific effect on both the DMN integrity and task-related brain activations in cognitively unimpaired PD patients, and these effects seem to be dose-dependent},

    abstract = {Considering that there are several theoretical reasons why fMRI data is correlated to variations in heart rate, these correlations are explored using experimental resting state data. In particular, the possibility is discussed that the "default network", being a brain area that deactivates during non-specific general tasks, is a hemodynamic effect caused by heart rate variations. Of fifteen healthy controls ECG, EEG and fMRI were co-registered. Slice time dependent heart rate regressors were derived from the ECG data and correlated to fMRI using a linear correlation analysis where the impulse response is estimated from the data. It was found that in most subjects substantial correlations between heart rate variations and fMRI exist, both within the brain and at the ventricles. The brain areas with high correlation to heart rate are different from the "default network" and the response functions deviate from the canonical hemodynamic response function. Furthermore, a general negative correlation was found between heart beat intervals (reverse of heart rate) and alpha power. We interpret this finding by assuming that subject's state varies between drowsiness and wakefulness. Finally, given this large correlation, we re-examined the contribution of heart rate variations to earlier reported fMRI/alpha band correlations, by adding heart rate regressors as confounders. It was found that inclusion of these confounders most often had a negligible effect. From its strong correlation to alpha power, we conclude that the heart rate variations contain important physiological information about subject's resting state. However, it does not provide a full explanation of the behaviour of the "default network". Its application as confounder in fMRI experiments is a relatively small computational effort, but may have a substantial impact in paradigms where heart rate is controlled by the stimulus.},

However, several lines of evidence indicate that subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia and the thalamus are also involved in episodic memory function. Recent studies have revealed age-related changes in functional connectivity between different brain areas, as measured by resting state fMRI. It remains to be shown whether functional connectivity measures in the basal ganglia and the thalamus can be associated with age-related changes in memory function. Here, we investigate this question by applying high model order spatial independent component analysis to resting state fMRI data in a cohort of 100 healthy elderly and relate connectivity features to verbal episodic memory function as assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). We identified five components that were located within different parts of the thalamus and the basal ganglia. Two of these components demonstrated negative correlations between their functional connectivity level and CVLT performance. We also found negative correlations between connectional strength within subcortical structures and CVLT performance. These results indicate a previously undocumented role for the putamen and the thalamus in verbal episodic memory function in aging.",

Moreover, we also found that the increased ALFF in the bilateral parietal lobe had a significantly positive correlation with the methadone does, thus we inferred that the reduced ALFF may due to heroin consumption, nevertheless, the increased ALFF in the bilateral parietal lobe may have resulted from the methadone treatment. This resting-state fMRI study suggests that the changed spontaneous neuronal activity of these regions may be implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of heroin addicts.",

    abstract = "Convergent data from various scientific approaches strongly implicate cerebellar systems in nonmotor functions. The functional anatomy of these systems has been pieced together from disparate sources, such as animal studies, lesion studies in humans, and structural and functional imaging studies in humans. To better define this distinct functional anatomy, in the current study we delineate the role of the cerebellum in several nonmotor systems simultaneously and in the same subjects using resting state functional connectivity MRI. Independent component analysis was applied to resting state data from two independent datasets to identify common cerebellar contributions to several previously identified intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) involved in executive control, episodic memory/self-reflection, salience detection, and sensorimotor function. We found distinct cerebellar contributions to each of these ICNs. The neocerebellum participates in (1) the right and left executive control networks (especially crus I and II), (2) the salience network (lobule VI), and (3) the default-mode network (lobule IX). Little to no overlap was detected between these cerebellar regions and the sensorimotor cerebellum (lobules V-VI). Clusters were also located in pontine and dentate nuclei, prominent points of convergence for cerebellar input and output, respectively. The results suggest that the most phylogenetically recent part of the cerebellum, particularly crus I and II, make contributions to parallel cortico-cerebellar loops involved in executive control, salience detection, and episodic memory/self-reflection. The largest portions of the neocerebellum take part in the executive control network implicated in higher cognitive functions such as working memory",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The human inferior frontal junction area (IFJ) is critically involved in three main component processes of cognitive control (working memory, task switching and inhibitory control). As it overlaps with several areas in established anatomical labeling schemes, it is considered to be underreported as a functionally distinct location in the neuroimaging literature. While recent studies explicitly focused on the IFJ s anatomical organization and functional role as a single brain area, it is usually not explicitly denominated in studies on cognitive networks. However based on few analyses in small datasets constrained by specific a priori assumptions on its functional specialization, the IFJ has been postulated to be part of a cognitive control network. Goal of this meta-analysis was to establish the IFJ's connectivity profile on a high formal level of evidence by aggregating published implicit knowledge about its co-activations. We applied meta-analytical connectivity modeling (MACM) based on the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method without specific assumptions regarding functional specialization on 180 (reporting left IFJ activity) and 131 (right IFJ) published functional neuroimaging experiments derived from the BrainMap database. This method is based on coordinates in stereotaxic space, not on anatomical descriptors. RESULTS: The IFJ is significantly co-activated with areas in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial frontal gyrus / pre-SMA, posterior parietal cortex, occipitotemporal junction / cerebellum, thalamus and putamen as well as language and motor areas. Results are corroborated by an independent resting-state fMRI analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the assumption that the IFJ is part of a previously described cognitive control network. They also highlight the involvement of subcortical structures in this system. A direct line is drawn from works on the functional significance of brain activity located at the IFJ and its anatomical definition to published results related to distributed cognitive brain systems. The IFJ is therefore introduced as a convenient starting point to investigate the cognitive control network in further studies",

While results from seed-based and independent component analysis methodologies are generally similar, they are conceptually different. This study is intended to elucidate and illustrate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the relationship between seed and independent component analysis derived measures of FC.

There is a growing consensus that ADHD is associated with abnormal function of diffuse brain networks, but such alterations remain poorly characterized. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized multivariate (complex network measures), bivariate (network-based statistic), and univariate (regional homogeneity) properties of brain networks in a non-clinical, drug-naive sample of high-functioning young men and women with ADHD (nine males, seven females) and a group of matched healthy controls. Data from our sample allowed the isolation of intrinsic functional connectivity alterations specific to ADHD diagnosis and symptoms that are not related to developmental delays, general cognitive dysfunction, or history of medication use. Multivariate results suggested that frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices were abnormally connected locally as well as with the rest of the brain in individuals with ADHD. Results from the network-based statistic support and extend multivariate results by isolating two brain networks comprising regions between which inter-regional connectivity was significantly altered in the ADHD group; namely, a frontal amygdala-occipital network and a frontal temporal-occipital network. Brain behavior correlations further highlighted the key role of altered orbitofrontal-temporal and frontal-amygdala connectivity for symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. All univariate properties were similar between groups. Taken together, results from this study show that the diagnosis and the two main symptom dimensions of ADHD are related to altered intrinsic connectivity in orbitofrontal-temporal-occipital and fronto-amygdala-occipital networks. Accordingly, our findings highlight the importance of extending the conceptualization of ADHD beyond segregated fronto-striatal alterations",

Functional neuroimaging reveals cerebellar activation during a variety of cognitive tasks, including language, visual-spatial, executive, and working memory processes. It is important to note that overt movement is not a prerequisite for cerebellar activation: the cerebellum is engaged during conditions which either control for motor output or do not involve motor responses. Resting-state functional connectivity data reveal that, in addition to networks underlying motor control, the cerebellum is part of "cognitive" networks with prefrontal and parietal association cortices. Consistent with these findings, regional differences in activation patterns within the cerebellum are evident depending on the task demands, suggesting that the cerebellum can be broadly divided into functional regions based on the patterns of anatomical connectivity between different regions of the cerebellum and sensorimotor and association areas of the cerebral cortex. However, the distinct contribution of the cerebellum to cognitive tasks is not clear. Here, the functional neuroimaging evidence for cerebellar involvement in cognitive functions is reviewed and related to hypotheses as to why the cerebellum is active during such tasks. Identifying the precise role of the cerebellum in cognition-as well as the mechanism by which the cerebellum modulates performance during a wide range of tasks-remains a challenge for future investigations},

To address this issue, in the present study, we first mapped boundaries and 2 adjacent activations in the human inferior frontal cortex, and then examined the spatial relationship between the boundaries and the 2 activations. The boundaries mapped with high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a collection of micromodules, the size of which was approximately only 12 mm on average, much smaller than the Brodmann areas. Each of the 2 activations associated with 2 functions, response inhibition and feedback processing, was smaller in size than the micromodules. By comparing the spatial patterns between the boundaries and the 2 activations, it was revealed that the brain activations were less likely to be located on the boundaries. These results suggest the functional relevance of the areas in the association cortex delineated by the boundary mapping method based on resting-state functional connectivity MRI",

    abstract = "In this study, we investigated the changes in topological architectures of brain functional networks in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were obtained from 19 children with ADHD and 20 healthy controls during resting state. Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrix between 90 cortical and subcortical regions and further analyzed by applying graph theoretical approaches. Experimental results showed that, although brain networks of both groups exhibited economical small-world topology, altered functional networks were demonstrated in the brain of ADHD when compared with the normal controls. In particular, increased local efficiencies combined with a decreasing tendency in global efficiencies found in ADHD suggested a disorder-related shift of the topology toward regular networks. Additionally, significant alterations in nodal efficiency were also found in ADHD, involving prefrontal, temporal, and occipital cortex regions, which were compatible with previous ADHD studies. The present study provided the first evidence for brain dysfunction in ADHD from the viewpoint of global organization of brain functional networks by using resting-state fMRI.",

To obtain a reliable estimate of frontal theta power we applied ICA on band-pass filtered (2-9 Hz) EEG data. For each subject we selected the component that best matched the mid-frontal scalp topography associated with the frontal theta rhythm. We applied a time-frequency analysis on this component and used the time course of the frequency bin with the highest overall power to form a regressor that modeled spontaneous fluctuations in frontal theta power. No significant positive BOLD correlations with this regressor were observed. Extensive negative correlations were observed in the areas that together form the default mode network. We conclude that frontal theta activity can be seen as an EEG index of default mode network activity",

    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the functional connectivity (FC) pattern within an intrinsic functional organization, including both task-positive (TPN) and task-negative (TNN) networks, in major depressive disorder (MDD), and to examine relationships between the involved FCs and clinical variables.METHODS: Resting-state FC analyses were used to identify the component brain regions of the intrinsic organization and to investigate the FCs of the individual component regions in 18 first-episode, medication-na\"{\i}ve MDD and 20 healthy control subjects.RESULTS: We found that the intrinsic organization of the depressed group recruited more extensive regions than the control group. All of the altered FCs associated with the component regions increased in MDD. Specifically, in the TPN the increased FCs were primarily located in the bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices and the inferior parietal lobes, which have been implicated in attention and adaptive control. In the TNN, the increased FCs were primarily located in the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which are involved in episodic memory, self-reflection and emotional regulation. We also found increased anti-correlations between the two networks. Additionally, the strengths of the FCs associated with the lateral prefrontal cortices were found to be correlated with the duration of the depressive episode and the HDRS scores in the depressed patients.LIMITATIONS: Clinical correlates of these abnormal FCs should be cautiously interpreted due to the small sample size in this study.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the intrinsic organization may be an underlying basis for the pronounced and prolonged negative bias in processing emotional information observed in MDD.},

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrate that measuring correlations between brain regions in resting-state activity can be used to reveal intrinsic neural networks. To study the oscillatory dynamics that underlie intrinsic functional connectivity between regions requires high temporal resolution measures of electrophysiological brain activity, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, there is a lack of consensus as to the best method for examining connectivity in resting-state MEG data. Here we adapted a wavelet-based method for measuring phase-locking with respect to the frequency of neural oscillations. This method employs anatomical MRI information combined with MEG data using the minimum norm estimate inverse solution to produce functional connectivity maps from a "seed" region to all other locations on the cortical surface at any and all frequencies of interest. We test this method by simulating phase-locked oscillations at various points on the cortical surface, which illustrates a substantial artifact that results from imperfections in the inverse solution. We demonstrate that normalizing resting-state MEG data using phase-locking values computed on empty room data reduces much of the effects of this artifact. We then use this method with eight subjects to reveal intrinsic interhemispheric connectivity in the auditory network in the alpha frequency band in a silent environment. This spectral resting-state functional connectivity imaging method may allow us to better understand the oscillatory dynamics underlying intrinsic functional connectivity in the human brain.},

The activity of these areas decreases when subjects are engaged in a wide variety of laboratory tasks designed to study cognitive operations. It has been suggested that these areas, among them the medial parietal (precyneus) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, may support a "default state" of the human brain. Passive visual observation of laboratory stimuli typically yields no change in activity in these default areas compared to rest. Here we report functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on normal subjects watching realistic movie clips depicting everyday social interactions. In contrast with previous findings on default state brain areas, the observation of the relational segment of the movie clip, during which two persons interact, yielded increased activity in the medial parietal (precuneus) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, compared to rest and to observation of the segment of the movie clip depicting a single individual engaged in everyday activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of joint increased activity in medial parietal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. We suggest that the default state areas may participate in the processing of social relations in concert with regions previously identified as critical for social cognition that were also activated by our stimuli, including the inferior frontal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, and the fusiform gyrus.},

The neurobiological underpinnings of IGA should be studied to unravel the potential heterogeneity of IGA. This study investigated the brain functions in IGA patients with resting-state fMRI. METHODS: Fifteen IGA subjects and fourteen healthy controls participated in this study. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) measures were used to detect the abnormal functional integrations. RESULTS: Comparing to the healthy controls, IGA subjects show enhanced ReHo in brainstem, inferior parietal lobule, left posterior cerebellum, and left middle frontal gyrus. All of these regions are thought related with sensory-motor coordination. In addition, IGA subjects show decreased ReHo in temporal, occipital and parietal brain regions. These regions are thought responsible for visual and auditory functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that long-time online game playing enhanced the brain synchronization in sensory-motor coordination related brain regions and decreased the excitability in visual and auditory related brain regions",

However, the effect of antidepressant medications on human brain function is less clear and the effect of these drugs on resting-state functional connectivity is unknown. Forty volunteers matched for age and gender with no previous psychiatric history received either citalopram (SSRI; selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor), reboxetine (SNRI; selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor) or placebo for 7days in a double-blind design. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed based connectivity analysis we selected the right nucleus accumbens, the right amygdala, the subgenual cingulate and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex as seed regions. Mood and subjective experience were also measured before and after drug administration using self-report scales. Despite no differences in mood across the three groups, we found reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the citalopram group and the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex for the reboxetine group. We also found reduced striatal-orbitofrontal cortex connectivity in the reboxetine group. These data suggest that antidepressant medications can decrease resting-state functional connectivity independent of mood change and in areas known to mediate reward and emotional processing in the brain. We conclude that hypothesis-driven seed based analysis of resting-state fMRI supports the proposition that antidepressant medications might work by normalising the elevated resting-state functional connectivity seen in depressed patients.",

Low frequency oscillations and connectivity strength (CS) of resting state brain networks are altered in patients with schizophrenia (SZs). However, the relationship between these two measures has not yet been studied. Such work may be helpful in understanding the so-called "rich club" organization (i.e. high-CS nodes are more densely connected among themselves than are nodes of a lower CS in the human brain) in healthy controls (HCs) and SZs. Here we present a study of HCs and SZs examining low frequency oscillations and CS by first decomposing resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) data into independent components (ICs) using group independent component analysis (ICA) and computing the low frequency power ratio (LFPR) of each ICA time course. Weighted brain graphs consisting of ICs were built based on correlations between ICA time courses. Positive CS and negative CS of each node in the brain graphs were then examined. The correlations between LFPR and CSs as well as "rich club" coefficients of group mean brain graphs were assessed. Results demonstrate that the LFPR of some ICs were lower in SZs compared to HCs. In addition, LFPR was correlated with positive CS in HCs, but to a lesser extent in SZs. HCs showed higher normalized rich club parameter than SZs. The findings provide new insight into disordered intrinsic brain graphs in schizophrenia},

Previous AD research has used resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) to assess the integrity of functional networks within the brain. Most studies have focused on the default-mode network (DMN), a primary locus of AD pathology. However, other brain regions are inevitably affected with disease progression. We studied rs-fcMRI in five functionally defined brain networks within a large cohort of human participants of either gender (n = 510) that ranged in AD severity from unaffected [clinical dementia rating (CDR) 0] to very mild (CDR 0.5) to mild (CDR 1). We observed loss of correlations within not only the DMN but other networks at CDR 0.5. Within the salience network (SAL), increases were seen between CDR 0 and CDR 0.5. However, at CDR 1, all networks, including SAL, exhibited reduced correlations. Specific networks were preferentially affected at certain CDR stages. In addition, cross-network relations were consistently lost with increasing AD severity. Our results demonstrate that AD is associated with widespread loss of both intranetwork and internetwork correlations.

The ReHo off medication was negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in the putamen and some other regions, and was positively correlated with the UPDRS in the cerebellum. Administration of levodopa relatively normalized ReHo. Our findings demonstrate that neural activity in the resting state is changed in patients with PD.

    abstract = "Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most frequent form of focal epilepsy. At rest, there is evidence that brain abnormalities in MTLE are not limited to the epileptogenic region, but extend throughout the whole brain. It is also well established that MTLE patients suffer from episodic memory deficits. Thus, we investigated the relation between the functional connectivity seen at rest in fMRI and episodic memory impairments in MTLE. We focused on resting state BOLD activity and evaluated whether functional connectivity (FC) differences emerge from MTL seeds in left and right MTLE groups, compared with healthy controls. Results revealed significant FC reductions in both patient groups, localized in angular gyri, thalami, posterior cingulum and medial frontal cortex. We found that the FC between the left non-pathologic MTL and the medial frontal cortex was positively correlated with the delayed recall score of a non-verbal memory test in right MTLE patients, suggesting potential adaptive changes to preserve this memory function. In contrast, we observed a negative correlation between a verbal memory test and the FC between the left pathologic MTL and posterior cingulum in left MTLE patients, suggesting potential functional maladaptative changes in the pathologic hemisphere. Overall, the present study provides some indication that left MTLE may be more impairing than right MTLE patients to normative functional connectivity. Our data also indicates that the pattern of extra-temporal FC may vary as a function of episodic memory material and each hemisphere's capacity for cognitive reorganization.

    abstract = "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is associated with pathological changes along the dentatorubrothalamic tract and in premotor cortex. We aimed to assess whether functional neural connectivity is disrupted along this pathway in PSP, and to determine how functional changes relate to changes in structure and diffusion. Eighteen probable PSP subjects and 18 controls had resting-state (task-free) fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI. Functional connectivity was assessed between thalamus and the rest of the brain, and within the basal ganglia, salience and default mode networks (DMN). Patterns of atrophy were assessed using voxel-based morphometry, and patterns of white matter tract degeneration were assessed using tract-based spatial statistics. Reduced in-phase functional connectivity was observed between the thalamus and premotor cortex including supplemental motor area (SMA), striatum, thalamus and cerebellum in PSP. Reduced connectivity in premotor cortex, striatum and thalamus were observed in the basal ganglia network and DMN, with subcortical salience network reductions. Tract degeneration was observed between cerebellum and thalamus and in superior longitudinal fasciculus, with grey matter loss in frontal lobe, premotor cortex, SMA and caudate nucleus. SMA functional connectivity correlated with SMA volume and measures of cognitive and motor dysfunction, while thalamic connectivity correlated with degeneration of superior cerebellar peduncles. PSP is therefore associated with disrupted thalamocortical connectivity that is associated with degeneration of the dentatorubrothalamic tract and the presence of cortical atrophy.",

    abstract = {Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence underscores the strong and rapid antidepressant properties of the glutamate-modulating NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Targeting the glutamatergic system might thus provide a novel molecular strategy for antidepressant treatment. Since glutamate is the most abundant and major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, pathophysiological changes in glutamatergic signaling are likely to affect neurobehavioral plasticity, information processing and large-scale changes in functional brain connectivity underlying certain symptoms of major depressive disorder. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), the "dorsal nexus "(DN) was recently identified as a bilateral dorsal medial prefrontal cortex region showing dramatically increased depression-associated functional connectivity with large portions of a cognitive control network (CCN), the default mode network (DMN), and a rostral affective network (AN). Hence, Sheline and colleagues (2010) proposed that reducing increased connectivity of the DN might play a critical role in reducing depression symptomatology and thus represent a potential therapy target for affective disorders. Here, using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover rsfMRI challenge in healthy subjects we demonstrate that ketamine decreases functional connectivity of the DMN to the DN and to the pregenual anterior cingulate (PACC) and medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) via its representative hub, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). These findings in healthy subjects may serve as a model to elucidate potential biomechanisms that are addressed by successful treatment of major depression. This notion is further supported by the temporal overlap of our observation of subacute functional network modulation after 24 hours with the peak of efficacy following an intravenous ketamine administration in treatment-resistant depression},

Previous findings indicated that dysfunction of the emotional circuit might contribute to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying insomnia. The present study will test this hypothesis by examining alterations in functional connectivity of the amygdala in patients with primary insomnia (PI).METHODS: Resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to examine the temporal correlation between the amygdala and whole-brain regions in 10 medication-naive PI patients and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Additionally, the relationship between the abnormal functional connectivity and insomnia severity was investigated.RESULTS: We found decreased functional connectivity mainly between the amygdala and insula, striatum and thalamus, and increased functional connectivity mainly between the amygdala and premotor cortex, sensorimotor cortex in PI patients as compared to healthy controls. The connectivity of the amygdala with the premotor cortex in PI patients showed significant positive correlation with the total score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).CONCLUSIONS: The decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula, striatum, and thalamus suggests that dysfunction in the emotional circuit might contribute to the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PI. The increased functional connectivity of the amygdala with the premotor and sensorimotor cortex demonstrates a compensatory mechanism to overcome the negative effects of sleep deficits and maintain the psychomotor performances in PI patients",

At present, the cause and mechanism of AD are yet unclear, and there is no effective therapy for treating it. With development of global aging, the prevalence rate of AD is increasing. The life quality of elderly people is affected severely by AD that is ultimately life-threatening. Recently, study on treating AD with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has deepened.OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effects of a syndrome differentiation-based TCM regime in treating patients with mild to moderate AD for improving cognition, and to evaluate the changes in brain function of AD patients observed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Adopting the internationally recognized criteria developed by National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association, the clinical trial was conducted on 131 patients with mild to moderate AD from 5 communities and 7 social welfare institutions. Participants were accepted after informed consent was received, and laboratory tests and a head imaging study were conducted. The patients were randomly divided into Chinese medicine group (CMG) (66 cases) or Western medicine group (WMG) (65 cases). Patients in the CMG were treated monthly with Chinese medicine according to syndrome differentiation. Patients in the WMG were treated with donepezil at a dose of 5 mg once daily. The therapeutic course lasted 48 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Fuld Object-Memory Evaluation (FOM), Block Design (BD) and Digit Span (DS) were used to evaluate the cognitive function; resting-state fMRI was used for observing brain function. The questionnaires and fMRI were performed before and after treatments.RESULTS: The cognitive functions of the patients in the CMG and WMG were improved after treatment. MMSE score was improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05 or P<0.001). After 48 weeks of treatment, 70.91\% patients in the CMG had an improved MMSE score and 20\% got worse, however, 55.77\% patients in the WMG were improved in MMSE score and 34.62\% got worse. Scores of FOM denominator and BD increased significantly in both groups; scores of FOM numerator and DS were also increased in the CMG (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The results of fMRI suggested that both Chinese medicine and donepezil treatment improved the connectivity between posterior cingulated gyrus and specific areas in the brain. The influence range of Chinese medicine primarily impacted on the left parietal lobe, being less than the influence range of donepezil, which primarily affected both sides of frontal lobes.CONCLUSION: TCM treatment based on syndrome differentiation is effective in improving cognitive function of patients with mild to moderate AD and increasing the brain function by increasing connectivity between posterior cingulated gyrus and specific areas in the brain",

A network of regions consistent with the known functional anatomy of visual processing was correlated with MT/V5 during rest. When subjects were viewing motion, a more limited network was correlated with MT/V5, suggesting MT/V5 was acting in concert with a smaller network specific to the task.",

Previous studies have shown that brain functional activity in the default mode network (DMN) is impaired in AD patients.

The present study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to investigate DMN activity in 14 amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients and 14 healthy elderly. Compared to the aMCI patients, the healthy elderly exhibited increased functional activity in the DMN regions, including the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, right inferior parietal lobule, and left fusiform gyrus, as well as a trend towards increased right medial temporal lobe activity. The aMCI patients exhibited increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and middle temporal gyrus compared to the healthy elderly. Increased frontal-parietal activity may indicate compensatory processes in the aMCI patients. These findings suggest that abnormal DMN activity could be useful as an imaging-based biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of aMCI patients.",

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients appear to be particularly vulnerable to AD. However, little is currently known whether altered patterns of cerebellar function occur in aMCI patients. 26 aMCI patients and 18 well-matched healthy controls underwent a baseline resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. After a mean follow-up period of 20 months, the subjects who successfully completed baseline fMRI scans underwent a further follow-up scan, while spontaneous activation and functional connectivity of the cerebellum were explored by using resting-state fMRI. Compared to controls, increased amplitude of low frequency fluctuation of the posterior cerebellar lobe may contribute to the underlying mechanisms affected, while greater decreased functional connections to the posterior cerebellar lobe were identified in the longitudinal study of aMCI patients. This suggests that abnormal functional connectivity of the cerebellum may offer a more sensitive and possibly preferred index of functional disturbance than regional activity measures in aMCI patients. The cerebellum may be partly related to the underlying mechanisms of aMCI, and it could help guide subsequent investigations designed to specify the precise functional role of cerebellum in aMCI patients.",

The patient group showed decreased resting state functional connectivity between the thalamus and the cortex.CONCLUSION: This supports the idea that chronic pain can alter thalamocortical connections causing a disruption of thalamic feedback, and the view of chronic pain as a thalamocortical dysrhythmia",

The neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM' chanting are yet to be explored.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the neurohemodynamic correlates of audible 'OM' chanting were examined in right-handed healthy volunteers (n=12; nine men). The 'OM' chanting condition was compared with pronunciation of "ssss" as well as a rest state. fMRI analysis was done using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (SPM5).RESULTS: In this study, significant deactivation was observed bilaterally during 'OM' chanting in comparison to the resting brain state in bilateral orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, thalami and hippocampi. The right amygdala too demonstrated significant deactivation. No significant activation was observed during 'OM' chanting. In contrast, neither activation nor deactivation occurred in these brain regions during the comparative task - namely the 'ssss' pronunciation condition.CONCLUSION: The neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM' chanting indicate limbic deactivation. As similar observations have been recorded with vagus nerve stimulation treatment used in depression and epilepsy, the study findings argue for a potential role of this 'OM' chanting in clinical practice.},

    abstract = "A major challenge for fMRI at high spatial resolution is the limited temporal resolution. The UNFOLD method increases image acquisition speed and potentially enables high acceleration factors in fMRI. Spatial aliasing artifacts due to interleaved k-space sampling are to be removed from the image time series by temporal filtering before statistical mapping in the time domain can be carried out. So far, low-pass filtering and multi-band filtering have been proposed. Particularly at high UNFOLD factors both methods are non-optimal. Low-pass filtering severely degrades temporal resolution and multi-band filtering leads to temporal autocorrelations affecting statistical modelling of activation. In this work, we present a novel temporal filtering strategy that significantly reduces temporal autocorrelations compared to multi-band filtering. Two datasets (finger-tapping and resting state) were post-processed using the proposed and the multi-band filter with varying set-ups (i.e. transition bands). When the proposed filtering strategy was used, a linear regression analysis revealed that the number of false positives was significantly decreased up to 34\% whereas the number of activated voxels was not significantly affected for most filter parameters. In total, this led to an effective increase in the number of activated voxels per false positive for each filter set-up. At a significance level of 5\%, the number of activated voxels was increased up to 41\% by using the proposed filtering strategy",

Twenty-nine patients with HE (15 with overt and 14 with minimal HE) and 17 healthy control subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The ALFF, an index reflecting the amplitudes of spontaneous brain activity, was compared among patients with overt HE, patients with minimal HE, and control subjects with analysis of variance tests and t tests between each pair. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the ALFF and the venous blood ammonia level and Child-Pugh score of all patients with HE.Results:Compared with control subjects, patients with overt and minimal HE showed decreased ALFF mainly in regions within the default-mode network (DMN) and increased ALFF in the cerebellum and middle temporal gyrus. Compared with patients with minimal HE, those with overt HE showed decreased ALFF in DMN regions and increased ALFF in the posterior insular cortex (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Both the venous blood ammonia levels and Child-Pugh scores of individual patients with HE showed negative correlation with ALFF within some DMN regions, whereas they showed positive correlation with ALFF in the posterior insular cortex (P < .05, corrected for multiple comparisons).Conclusion:Patients with HE have diffuse abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity. The levels of decreased ALFF in the DMN and increased ALFF in the posterior insular cortex are dependent on the severity of HE, suggesting continuous impairment of the DMN and a compensatory role of the insula during the progression of HE. Resting-state functional MR imaging with ALFF analysis may be a noninvasive modality with which to detect the progression of HE.© RSNA, 2012Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12111429/-/DC1",

    abstract = "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) syndrome is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, characterized by excessive snoring and repetitive apnoeas and arousals, which leads to fragmented sleep and, most importantly, to intermittent nocturnal hypoxaemia during apnoeas. Considering previous studies about morphovolumetric alterations in sleep apnoea, in this study we aimed to investigate for the first time the functional connectivity profile of OSA patients and age-gender-matched healthy controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty severe OSA patients (mean age 43.2 ± 8 years; mean apnoea-hypopnoea index, 36.3 h(-1) ) and 20 non-apnoeic age-gender-body mass index (BMI)-matched controls underwent fMRI and polysomnographic (PSG) registration, as well as mood and sleepiness evaluation. Cerebro-cerebellar regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were calculated from fMRI acquisition, in order to identify pathology-related alterations in the local coherence of low-frequency signal (<0.1 Hz). Multivariate pattern classification was also performed using ReHo values as features. We found a significant pattern of cortical and subcortical abnormal local connectivity in OSA patients, suggesting an overall rearrangement of hemispheric connectivity balance, with a decrease of local coherence observed in right temporal, parietal and frontal lobe regions. Moreover, an increase in bilateral thalamic and somatosensory/motor cortices coherence have been found, a finding due possibly to an aberrant adaptation to incomplete sleep-wake transitions during nocturnal apnoeic episodes, induced by repetitive choke sensation and physical efforts attempting to restore breathing. Different hemispheric roles into sleep processes and a possible thalamus key role in OSA neurophysiopathology are intriguing issues that future studies should attempt to clarify",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired in polysomnographically validated wakefulness, light sleep, and slow-wave sleep to examine the hierarchical structure of a low-frequency functional brain network, and to examine whether frontoparietal connectivity would disintegrate in sleep. Whole-brain analyses with hierarchical cluster analysis on predefined atlases were performed, as well as regression of inferior parietal lobules (IPL) seeds against all voxels in the brain, and an evaluation of the integrity of voxel time-courses in subcortical regions-of-interest. We observed that frontoparietal functional connectivity disintegrated in sleep stage 1 and was absent in deeper sleep stages. Slow-wave sleep was characterized by strong hierarchical clustering of local submodules. Frontoparietal connectivity between IPL and superior medial and right frontal gyrus was lower in sleep stages than in wakefulness. Moreover, thalamus voxels showed maintained integrity in sleep stage 1, making intrathalamic desynchronization an unlikely source of reduced thalamocortical connectivity in this sleep stage. Our data suggest a transition from a globally integrated functional brain network in wakefulness to a disintegrated network consisting of local submodules in slow-wave sleep, in which frontoparietal inter-modular nodes may play a role, possibly in combination with the thalamus",

The purpose of this study was to investigate quantitatively the correspondence between the connectivity information provided by the 2 techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, resting-state fMRI data from 40 healthy participants were independently analyzed by using spatial ICA and ROI-based analysis. To assess the correspondence between the results provided by the 2 methods, for all combinations of ROIs, we compared the time course correlation coefficient with the corresponding "ICA coactivation index."RESULTS: A strongly significant correspondence of moderate intensity was found for 20 ICA components (r = 0.44, P < .001). Repeating the analysis with 10, 15, 25, 30, 35, and 40 components, we found that the correlation remained but was weaker (r = 0.35-0.41). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant but not complete correspondence between the results provided by ICA and ROI-based analysis of resting-state data},

    abstract = "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) shows significant potential as a tool for predicting clinically important information such as future disease progression or drug effect from brain activity. Multivariate techniques have been developed that combine fMRI signals from across the brain to produce more robust predictive capabilities than can be obtained from single regions. However, the high dimensionality of fMRI data makes overfitting a significant problem. Reliable methods are needed for transforming fMRI data to a set of signals reflecting the underlying spatially extended patterns of neural dynamics. This paper demonstrates a task-specific Independent Component Analysis (ICA) procedure which identifies signals associated with coherent functional brain networks, and shows that these signals can be used for accurate and interpretable prediction. The task-specific ICA parcellations outperformed other feature generation methods in two separate datasets including parcellations based on resting-state data and anatomy. The pattern of response of the task-specific ICA parcellations to particular feature selection strategies indicates that they identify important functional networks associated with the discriminative task. We show ICA parcellations to be robust and informative with respect to non-neural artefacts affecting the fMRI series. Together, these results suggest that task-specific ICA parcellation is a powerful technique for producing predictive and informative signals from fMRI time series. The results presented in this paper also contribute evidence for the general functional validity of the parcellations produced by ICA approaches",

Research has shown widespread behavioural effects and numerous potential therapeutic benefits. However, little is known about how OT triggers these effects in the brain. Here, we discuss some of the physiological properties of OT in the human brain including the long half-life of neuropeptides, the diffuse projections of OT throughout the brain and interactions with other systems such as the dopaminergic system. These properties indicate that OT acts without clear spatial and temporal specificity. Therefore, it is likely to have widespread effects on the brain's intrinsic functioning. Additionally, we review studies that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) concurrently with OT administration. These studies reveal a specific set of 'social' brain regions that are likely to be the strongest targets for OT's potential to influence human behaviour. On the basis of the fMRI literature and the physiological properties of the neuropeptide, we argue that OT has the potential to not only modulate activity in a set of specific brain regions, but also the functional connectivity between these regions. In light of the increasing knowledge of the behavioural effects of OT in humans, studies of the effects of OT administration on brain function can contribute to our understanding of the neural networks in the social brain",

During normal conditions, baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 110+/-10 mm Hg and low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal were observed in the frequency range of 0.01 to 0.125 Hz. Following blood withdrawal (exsanguination), MAP decreased to 68+/-7 mm Hg, resulting in an increase in the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal time series and an increase in power at several frequencies between 0.01 and 0.125 Hz. Spatially, the BOLD fluctuations were confined to the cortex and thalamus spanning both hemispheres with sparse presence in the caudate putamen and hippocampus during both normal and exsanguinated states. Spatial distribution of the low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal, from cross-correlation analysis, indicates substantial inter-hemispheric synchrony similar to that observed in the conscious human brain. The behavior of the resting state BOLD signal fluctuations similar to CBF fluctuations during exsanguination indicates a myogenic dependence. Also, a high inter-hemispheric synchrony combined with different phase characteristics of the low-frequency BOLD fluctuations particularly in the hippocampus relative to the cortex emphasizes distinct functional networks.",

Furthermore, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) seems to play an important role for major depressive symptoms such as anhedonia and impaired emotion processing. We investigated 22 MDD patients and 22 healthy subjects using a combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach. Severity of depression was rated using the 21-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and patients were divided into severely and mildly depressed subgroups according to HAMD scores. Because of their hypothesized role in depression we investigated the functional connectivity between pgACC and left anterior insular cortex (AI). The sum of Glutamate and Glutamine (Glx) in the pgACC, but not in left AI, predicted the resting-state functional connectivity between the two regions exclusively in depressed patients. Furthermore, functional connectivity between these regions was significantly altered in the subgroup of severely depressed patients (HAMD > 15) compared to healthy subjects and mildly depressed patients. Similarly the Glx ratios, relative to Creatine, in the pgACC were lowest in severely depressed patients. These findings support the involvement of glutamatergic mechanisms in severe MDD which are related to the functional connectivity between pgACC and AI and depression severity.",

Several authors propose some form of cognitive processing to underlie BOLD signal changes in the DMN as activity within the network is modulated by the level of effort required by the task and is positively correlated with self-referential processing. Alternatively, BOLD signal changes within the DMN may be caused by cardiorespiratory processes (CR) affecting BOLD signal measurements independent of neuronal activity. The goal of this study is to investigate whether BOLD signal changes within the DMN can be explained by CR effects. To this aim, brain activity, heartbeat, and respiration are measured during resting-state and while subjects perform a cognitive task with a high- and low-demand condition. To correct for CR effects we used RETROICOR (Glover et al., [2000]: Magn Reson Med 44:162-167) in combination with additive linear modeling of changes due to respiration volume, heart rate and heart rate variability. CR effects were present within the frequency-range of the DMN and were located in areas of the DMN, but equally so in other areas. After removal of CR effects, deactivation and resting-state connectivity between the areas of the DMN remained significant. In addition, DMN deactivation was still modulated by task demand. The same CR correction method did remove activation in task-related areas. We take these results to indicate that the BOLD signal within the DMN cannot be explained by CR effects alone and is possibly related to some form of cognitive neuronal processing",

Higher-insulin women had significantly reduced positive associations between the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal regions extending to the right hippocampus, and conversely, between the left and right hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Neuropsychological data (all within normal ranges) also showed significant differences with respect to executive functioning and global intelligence. The results provide further evidence of deleterious effects of IR on the hippocampus and cognition.

Recent studies have demonstrated that spontaneous brain oscillations and functional connectivity dissociate during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep; this leads to spontaneous cognitive processes such as memory consolidation and emotional modulation. However, variations in network connectivity across the sleep stages or between sleep/wake transitions require further elucidation. We observed changes in the connectivity of the sensorimotor and default-mode networks mediated by midnight sleep among 18 healthy participants. The results indicated that (1) functional connectivity in both networks showed increasing dissociation as NREM sleep deepened, whereas hyperconnectivity occurred during REM sleep; and (2) compared with connectivity prior to sleep, the default-mode network presented a comparable connectivity pattern immediately after awakening, whereas the connectivity of the sensorimotor network remained disrupted. These findings showed that connectivity patterns dissociate and reconnect coherently in both cortical networks during NREM and REM sleep, respectively. After the person awakened, the default-mode network connectivity was re-established prior to the sensorimotor reconnection. These dynamic sleep-related dissociations and reconnections between sleep/wake conditions might provide the key to understanding cognitive modulations in sleep. If so, connectivity changes might serve as an alternative indicator beyond the EEG signature to unveil the spontaneous processes that occur during sleep",

We propose here a generic statistical framework to quantify the stability of such resting-state networks (RSNs), which was implemented with k-means clustering. The core of the method consists in bootstrapping the available datasets to replicate the clustering process a large number of times and quantify the stable features across all replications. This bootstrap analysis of stable clusters (BASC) has several benefits: (1) it can be implemented in a multi-level fashion to investigate stable RSNs at the level of individual subjects and at the level of a group; (2) it provides a principled measure of RSN stability; and (3) the maximization of the stability measure can be used as a natural criterion to select the number of RSNs. A simulation study validated the good performance of the multi-level BASC on purely synthetic data. Stable networks were also derived from a real resting-state study for 43 subjects. At the group level, seven RSNs were identified which exhibited a good agreement with the previous findings from the literature. The comparison between the individual and group-level stability maps demonstrated the capacity of BASC to establish successful correspondences between these two levels of analysis and at the same time retain some interesting subject-specific characteristics, e.g. the specific involvement of subcortical regions in the visual and fronto-parietal networks for some subjects.",

Moral judgment is as a special instance of decision making, in which both cognitive and emotional signals must be adequately integrated to decide how to resolve moral dilemmas. Here, we employed a moral dilemmas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task to explore possible alterations of frontolimbic systems in cocaine-dependent subjects. We also explored if these alterations relate to more basic deficits in functional connectivity within these systems during spontaneous resting-state activation. Ten cocaine-dependent subjects and 14 non-drug-using controls participated in the study. Cocaine-dependent subjects were carefully selected to discard potentially confounding co-morbidities, and they underwent a uniform supervised abstinence period of 10 days. Both groups were scanned, and fMRI maps were generated to identify (1) brain response to moral dilemmas; and (2) the strength of functional connectivity within frontolimbic systems during resting-state. During the moral dilemmas task, cocaine-dependent subjects showed reduced activation involving frontolimbic structures as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left insula and brain stem. Connectivity analyses showed that cocaine users had less resting-state functional connectivity between ACC, thalamus, insula and brain stem. These results demonstrate that cocaine-dependent subjects have functional alterations in the frontolimbic systems that support moral judgment and social decision making",

EEG and MEG signals are mainly produced by postsynaptic ionic currents of synchronically active pyramidal cortical neurons. These signals reflect the integrative information processing of neurons representing the output of cortical neural modules. EEG and MEG signals have a high temporal resolution (<1ms) ideal to investigate an emerging propriety of brain physiology, namely the brain rhythms. A background spontaneous oscillatory activity of brain neurons at about 10Hz generates dominant alpha rhythms of resting-state EEG and MEG activity. This background activity is blocked during sensory and cognitive-motor events. Standard EEG shows a low spatial resolution (5-9cm), which partially improves by high-resolution EEG including 64-128 channels and source estimation techniques (1-3cm); source estimation of MEG data shows a better spatial resolution (0.5-2cm). fMRI is an indirect measurement of regional brain activity based on the ratio between deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin blood (BOLD) during events referenced to baseline conditions. Event-related BOLD response has low temporal resolution (>1s) and quite high spatial resolution (<1cm), and is especially suitable to investigate spatial details of both cortical and subcortical activation.",

    abstract = "Energy demands are becoming recognized as an important constraint on neural signaling. The olfactory glomerulus provides a well defined system for analyzing this question. Odor stimulation elicits high-energy demands in olfactory glomeruli where olfactory axons converge onto dendrites of olfactory bulb neurons. We performed a quantitative analysis of the energy demands of each type of neuronal element within the glomerulus. This included the volumes of each element, their surface areas, and ion loads associated with membrane potentials and synaptic activation as constrained by experimental observations. In the resting state, there was a high-energy demand compared with other brain regions because of the high density of neural elements. The activated state was dominated by the energy demands of action potential propagation in afferent olfactory sensory neurons and their synaptic input to dendritic tufts, whereas subsequent dendritic potentials and dendrodendritic transmission contributed only a minor share of costs. It is proposed therefore that afferent input and axodendritic transmission account for the strong signals registered by 2-deoxyglucose and functional magnetic resonance imaging, although postsynaptic dendrites comprise at least one-half of the volume of the glomerulus. The results further suggest that presynaptic inhibition of the axon terminals by periglomerular cells plays an important role in limiting the range of excitation of the postsynaptic cells. These results provide a new quantitative basis for interpreting olfactory bulb activation patterns elicited by odor stimulation.",

A paired sample t-test was used to test the amplitude differences of low-frequency brain activity fluctuations between these two conditions. With 72 hours in a -6° HDT, the participants showed a decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left thalamus compared with the normal condition (a combined threshold of P<0.005 and a minimum cluster size of 351 mm(3) (13 voxels), which corresponded with the corrected threshold of P<0.05 determined by AlphaSim). Our findings indicate that a gravity change-induced redistribution of body fluid may disrupt the function of the left thalamus in the resting state, which may contribute to reduced motor control abilities and multiple executive functions in astronauts in a microgravity environment",

The present study explores the link between endogenous dynamics of functional connectivity and autonomic state in an eyes-closed resting condition. Using a sliding window analysis on resting state fMRI data from 35 young, healthy male subjects, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) covaries with temporal changes in whole-brain functional connectivity with seed regions previously described to mediate effects of vigilance and arousal (amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; dACC). We identified a set of regions, including brainstem, thalamus, putamen, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that became more strongly coupled with the dACC and amygdala seeds during states of elevated HRV. Effects differed between high and low frequency components of HRV, suggesting specific contributions of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone on individual connections. Furthermore, dynamics of functional connectivity could be separated from those primarily related to BOLD signal fluctuations. The present results contribute novel information about the neural basis of transient changes of autonomic nervous system states, and suggest physiological and psychological components of the recently observed non-stationarity in resting state functional connectivity",

Previous group analyses of positron emission tomography data in clinically depressed patients, for example, have shown that resting-state connectivity prior to therapy predicts how patients eventually respond to pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Such applications would be considerably more informative for clinical decision making if these connectivity methods could be extended into the individual subject domain. To test such an extension, 46 treatment-na\"{\i}ve depressed patients were enrolled in an fMRI study to model baseline resting-state functional connectivity. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired and submitted to exploratory structural equation modeling (SEM) to derive the optimal group connectivity model. Jackknife and split sample tests confirm that group model was highly reproducible, and path weights were consistent across the best five group models. When this model was applied to data from individual subjects, 85\% of patients fit the group model. Histogram analysis of individual subjects' paths indicate that some paths are better representative of group membership. These results suggest that exploratory SEM is a viable technique for neuroimaging connectivity analyses of individual subjects' resting-state fMRI data.},

    abstract = {Recent findings identified electroencephalography (EEG) microstates as the electrophysiological correlates of fMRI resting-state networks. Microstates are defined as short periods (100 ms) during which the EEG scalp topography remains quasi-stable; that is, the global topography is fixed but strength might vary and polarity invert. Microstates represent the subsecond coherent activation within global functional brain networks. Surprisingly, these rapidly changing EEG microstates correlate significantly with activity in fMRI resting-state networks after convolution with the hemodynamic response function that constitutes a strong temporal smoothing filter. We postulate here that microstate sequences should reveal scale-free, self-similar dynamics to explain this remarkable effect and thus that microstate time series show dependencies over long time ranges. To that aim, we deploy wavelet-based fractal analysis that allows determining scale-free behavior. We find strong statistical evidence that microstate sequences are scale free over six dyadic scales covering the 256-ms to 16-s range. The degree of long-range dependency is maintained when shuffling the local microstate labels but becomes indistinguishable from white noise when equalizing microstate durations, which indicates that temporal dynamics are their key characteristic. These results advance the understanding of temporal dynamics of brain-scale neuronal network models such as the global workspace model. Whereas microstates can be considered the "atoms of thoughts," the shortest constituting elements of cognition, they carry a dynamic signature that is reminiscent at characteristic timescales up to multiple seconds. The scale-free dynamics of the microstates might be the basis for the rapid reorganization and adaptation of the functional networks of the brain.},

The aim of this study was to further characterize the dynamic nature of the brain at rest by investigating the presence and distribution of coherent, transient BOLD activity in resting fMRI data using a novel method of fMRI data analysis--2dTCA.MATERIAL/METHODS:High-field fMRI data were acquired in 27 subjects. The temporal clustering analysis, 2dTCA, was implemented to determine the timing of significant, spatially coherent, transient BOLD signal changes. Group maps of positive and negative coherent BOLD changes from each timing profile were created.RESULTS:Spontaneous increases in BOLD activity at both 3T and 4T and decreases at 4T were found in regions of the alpha rhythm circuit including the thalamus, precuneus and the occipital cortex. Additional positive and negative oscillations at 4T and a small region of positive activity at 3T were identified in the area of the brain stem reticular formation, the control center for maintaining arousal and motivation.CONCLUSIONS:These results provide additional evidence for the presence of dynamic functional networks in the resting brain that are active while the subjects appear to be at rest and that are spatially distributed in areas responsible for maintaining consciousness and vigilance including brain stem.

It was also found that the prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, amygdala, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and insula regions provided the most discriminant features for classification, in line with the results reported in previous studies.

This study investigated the functional connectivity between the PCC and MFG/vACC during a working memory task and at rest by examining temporal correlations in magnetic resonance signal levels between the regions. The two regions were functionally connected in both conditions. In addition, performance on the working memory task was positively correlated with the strength of this functional connection not only during the working memory task, but also at rest. Thus, it appears these regions are components of a network that may facilitate or monitor cognitive performance, rather than becoming disengaged during cognitive tasks. In addition, these data raise the possibility that the individual differences in coupling strength between these two regions at rest predict differences in cognitive abilities important for this working memory task",

However, the value of resting-state studies to a better understanding of brain-behavior relationships has been challenged. That altered states of consciousness are a privileged way to study the relationships between spontaneous brain activity and behavior is proposed, and common resting-state brain activity features observed in various states of altered consciousness are reviewed. Early positron emission tomography studies showed that states of extremely low or high brain activity are often associated with unconsciousness. However, this relationship is not absolute, and the precise link between global brain metabolism and awareness remains yet difficult to assert. In contrast, voxel-based analyses identified a systematic impairment of associative frontoparieto-cingulate areas in altered states of consciousness, such as sleep, anesthesia, coma, vegetative state, epileptic loss of consciousness, and somnambulism. In parallel, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified structured patterns of slow neuronal oscillations in the resting human brain. Similar coherent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) systemwide patterns can also be found, in particular in the default-mode network, in several states of unconsciousness, such as coma, anesthesia, and slow-wave sleep. The latter results suggest that slow coherent spontaneous BOLD fluctuations cannot be exclusively a reflection of conscious mental activity, but may reflect default brain connectivity shaping brain areas of most likely interactions in a way that transcends levels of consciousness, and whose functional significance remains largely in the dark.",

In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), such functional connectivity is investigated commonly by correlating the time course of a chosen "seed voxel" with the remaining voxel time courses in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This approach is biased by the actual choice of the seed voxel, however, because it only shows functional connectivity for the chosen brain region while ignoring other potentially interesting patterns of coactivation. We used spatial independent component analysis (sICA) to assess cortical functional connectivity maps from resting state data. SICA does not depend on any chosen temporal profile of local brain activity. We hypothesized that sICA would be able to find functionally connected brain regions within sensory and motor regions in the absence of task-related brain activity. We also investigated functional connectivity patterns of several parietal regions including the superior parietal cortex and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The components of interest were selected in an automated fashion using predefined anatomical volumes of interest. SICA yielded connectivity maps of bilateral auditory, motor and visual cortices. Moreover, it showed that prefrontal and parietal areas are also functionally connected within and between hemispheres during the resting state. These connectivity maps showed an extremely high degree of consistency in spatial, temporal, and frequency parameters within and between subjects. These results are discussed in the context of the recent debate on the functional relevance of fluctuations of neural activity in the resting state.},

    abstract = "Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics-high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2-12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.",

    abstract = {Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a nexus of information processing and regulation in the brain. Reflecting this central role, ACC is structurally and functionally heterogeneous, a fact long appreciated in studies of non-human primates. Human neuroimaging studies also recognize this functional heterogeneity, with meta-analyses and task-based studies demonstrating the existence of motor, cognitive and affective subdivisions. In contrast to task-based approaches, examinations of resting-state functional connectivity enable the characterization of task-independent patterns of correlated activity. In a novel approach to understanding ACC functional segregation, we systematically mapped ACC functional connectivity during rest. We examined patterns of functional connectivity for 16 seed ROIs systematically placed throughout caudal, rostral, and subgenual ACC in each hemisphere. First, our data support the commonly observed rostral/caudal distinction, but also suggest the existence of a dorsal/ventral functional distinction. For each of these distinctions, more fine-grained patterns of differentiation were observed than commonly appreciated in human imaging studies. Second, we demonstrate the presence of negatively predicted relationships between distinct ACC functional networks. In particular, we highlight negative relationships between rostral ACC-based affective networks (including the "default mode network") and dorsal-caudal ACC-based frontoparietal attention networks. Finally, interhemispheric activations were more strongly correlated between homologous regions than in non-homologous regions. We discuss the implications of our work for understanding ACC function and potential applications to clinical populations},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate relations between subclinical levels of depressive symptoms and neural activation patterns during tasks previously shown to differentiate individuals with and without MDD. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess neural activations during active emotion regulation, a resting state scan, and reward processing. Participants were twelve females with a range of depressive symptoms who did not meet criteria for MDD. RESULTS: Increased depressive symptom severity predicted (1) decreased left midfrontal gyrus activation during reappraisal of sad stimuli; (2) increased right midfrontal gyrus activation during distraction from sad stimuli; (3) increased functional connectivity between a precuneus seed region and left orbitofrontal cortex during a resting state scan; and (4) increased paracingulate activation during non-win outcomes during a reward-processing task. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data shed light on relations between subclinical levels of depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal MDD diagnosis and neural activation patterns. Future studies will be needed to test the utility of these activation patterns for predicting MDD onset in at-risk samples",

    abstract = "This paper is about inferring or discovering the functional architecture of distributed systems using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). We describe a scheme that recovers the (dynamic) Bayesian dependency graph (connections in a network) using observed network activity. This network discovery uses Bayesian model selection to identify the sparsity structure (absence of edges or connections) in a graph that best explains observed time-series. The implicit adjacency matrix specifies the form of the network (e.g., cyclic or acyclic) and its graph-theoretical attributes (e.g., degree distribution). The scheme is illustrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series to discover functional brain networks. Crucially, it can be applied to experimentally evoked responses (activation studies) or endogenous activity in task-free (resting state) fMRI studies. Unlike conventional approaches to network discovery, DCM permits the analysis of directed and cyclic graphs. Furthermore, it eschews (implausible) Markovian assumptions about the serial independence of random fluctuations. The scheme furnishes a network description of distributed activity in the brain that is optimal in the sense of having the greatest conditional probability, relative to other networks. The networks are characterised in terms of their connectivity or adjacency matrices and conditional distributions over the directed (and reciprocal) effective connectivity between connected nodes or regions. We envisage that this approach will provide a useful complement to current analyses of functional connectivity for both activation and resting-state studies.",

This network was also significantly activated during the face perception task. The face perception task also activated additional areas in the frontal and parietal regions. Our results suggest that the "core" but not the "extended" network for face processing is already in some form of activation during the resting-state.

Twenty-seven adolescents with 22q11DS and 33 typically developing control adolescents matched for age, gender and handedness underwent an 8-minute resting state functional MRI session.

Between-group differences suggested both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the 22q11DS group, involving the default-mode, sensorimotor, visuo-spatial, and high level visual networks. Finally, atypical connectivity in the default-mode network, specifically within the left superior frontal gyrus region, correlated with prodromal symptom intensity and neuropsychological performances in the 22q11DS group.

The authors investigated resting-state functional connectivity in patients with delirium to elucidate possible neural mechanisms underlying this disorder.METHOD: Twenty-two patients underwent initial functional MRI at rest during an episode of delirium. Of these patients, 14 completed follow-up scans after the episode resolved. Twenty-two comparison subjects without delirium also underwent scanning. The authors assessed cortical functional connectivity using the seed region of the posterior cingulate cortex and functional connectivity strengths between a priori subcortical regions related to acetylcholine and dopamine on data from 20 initial and 13 follow-up scans.RESULTS: Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and posterior cingulate cortex activity were inversely correlated in comparison subjects but strongly correlated in patients during an episode of delirium as indicated by increased functional connectivity between the two regions. Although precuneus activity was positively correlated with posterior cingulate cortex activity in comparison subjects, the correlation was further increased in patients during an episode of delirium, and the increment was associated with less severity and shorter duration of delirium. Functional connectivity strengths of the intralaminar thalamic and caudate nuclei with other subcortical regions were reduced during an episode of delirium but recovered after resolution of the episode.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the disruption in reciprocity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the posterior cingulate cortex and reversible reduction of functional connectivity of subcortical regions may underlie the pathophysiology of delirium. In addition, enhanced integration in the posteromedial cortices may account for facilitating the rapid improvement of delirium",

In this study, we investigate how many RSN signal sources can be separated from the entire brain cortex using high dimension ICA analysis from a group dataset. Group data from 55 subjects was analyzed using temporal concatenation and a probabilistic independent component analysis algorithm. ICA repeatability testing verified that 60 of the 70 computed components were robustly detectable. Forty-two independent signal sources were identifiable as RSN, and 28 were related to artifacts or other noninterest sources (non-RSN). The depicted RSNs bore a closer match to functional neuroanatomy than the previously reported RSN components. The non-RSN sources have significantly lower temporal intersource connectivity than the RSN (P < 0.0003). We conclude that the high model order ICA of the group BOLD data enables functional segmentation of the brain cortex.

Consistent with this broad-reaching involvement in brain function, basal ganglia dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite recent advances in human neuroimaging, models of basal ganglia circuitry continue to rely primarily upon inference from animal studies. Here, we provide a comprehensive functional connectivity analysis of basal ganglia circuitry in humans through a functional magnetic resonance imaging examination during rest. Voxelwise regression analyses substantiated the hypothesized motor, cognitive, and affective divisions among striatal subregions, and provided in vivo evidence of a functional organization consistent with parallel and integrative loop models described in animals. Our findings also revealed subtler distinctions within striatal subregions not previously appreciated by task-based imaging approaches. For instance, the inferior ventral striatum is functionally connected with medial portions of orbitofrontal cortex, whereas a more superior ventral striatal seed is associated with medial and lateral portions. The ability to map multiple distinct striatal circuits in a single study in humans, as opposed to relying on meta-analyses of multiple studies, is a principal strength of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging.

    abstract = "PURPOSE: Recent immunopathologic and MRI findings suggest that tissue damage in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is not limited to spinal cord and optic nerve, but also in brain. Baseline brain activity can reveal the brain functional changes to the tissue damages and give clues to the pathophysiology of NMO, however, it has never been explored by resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). We used regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index in resting-state fMRI to investigate how baseline brain activity changes in patients with NMO.METHODS: Resting-state fMRIs collected from seventeen NMO patients and seventeen age- and sex-matched normal controls were compared to investigate the ALFF difference between the two groups. The relationships between ALFF in regions with significant group differences and the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), disease duration were further explored.RESULTS: Our results showed that NMO patients had significantly decreased ALFF in precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and lingual gyrus; and increased ALFF in middle frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus and thalamus, compared to normal controls. Moderate negative correlations were found between the EDSS and ALFF in the left middle frontal gyrus (r=-0.436, p=0.040) and the left caudate (r=-0.542, p=0.012).CONCLUSION: The abnormal baseline brain activity shown by resting-state fMRI in NMO is relevant to cognition, visual and motor systems. It implicates a complex baseline brain status of both functional impairments and adaptations caused by tissue damages in these systems, which gives clues to the pathophysiology of NMO",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness associated with the symptoms such as hallucination and delusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the abnormal resting-state functional connectivity patterns of schizophrenic patients which could identify furthest patients from healthy controls. METHODS: The whole-brain resting-state fMRI was performed on patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n=22) and on age- and gender-matched, healthy control subjects (n=22). To differentiate schizophrenic individuals from healthy controls, the multivariate classification analysis was employed. The weighted brain regions were got by reconstruction arithmetic to extract highly discriminative functional connectivity information. RESULTS: The results showed that 93.2\% (p<0.001) of the subjects were correctly classified via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. And most of the altered functional connections identified located within the visual cortical-, default-mode-, and sensorimotor network. Furthermore, in reconstruction arithmetic, the fusiform gyrus exhibited the greatest amount of weight. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that schizophrenic patients may be successfully differentiated from healthy subjects by using whole-brain resting-state fMRI, and the fusiform gyrus may play an important functional role in the physiological symptoms manifested by schizophrenic patients. The brain region of great weight may be the problematic region of information exchange in schizophrenia. Thus, our result may provide insights into the identification of potentially effective biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia",

    abstract = "The accurate prediction of general neuropsychiatric disorders, on an individual basis, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a challenging task of great clinical significance. Despite the progress to chart the differences between the healthy controls and patients at the group level, the pattern classification of functional brain networks across individuals is still less developed. In this paper we identify two novel neuroimaging measures that prove to be strongly predictive neuroimaging markers in pattern classification between healthy controls and general epileptic patients. These measures characterize two important aspects of the functional brain network in a quantitative manner: (i) coordinated operation among spatially distributed brain regions, and (ii) the asymmetry of bilaterally homologous brain regions, in terms of their global patterns of functional connectivity. This second measure offers a unique understanding of brain asymmetry at the network level, and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously used in pattern classification of functional brain networks. Using modern pattern-recognition approaches like sparse regression and support vector machine, we have achieved a cross-validated classification accuracy of 83.9\% (specificity: 82.5\%; sensitivity: 85\%) across individuals from a large dataset consisting of 180 healthy controls and epileptic patients. We identified significantly changed functional pathways and subnetworks in epileptic patients that underlie the pathophysiological mechanism of the impaired cognitive functions. Specifically, we find that the asymmetry of brain operation for epileptic patients is markedly enhanced in temporal lobe and limbic system, in comparison with healthy individuals. The present study indicates that with specifically designed informative neuroimaging markers, resting-state fMRI can serve as a most promising tool for clinical diagnosis, and also shed light onto the physiology behind complex neuropsychiatric disorders. The systematic approaches we present here are expected to have wider applications in general neuropsychiatric disorders",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful tool for examining functional connectivity and has revealed several canonical brain networks, including the default mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and salience networks. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in these networks in schizophrenia. 42 patients with schizophrenia and 61 healthy subjects completed a RS-fMRI scanning session. Seed-based region-of-interest correlation analysis was used to identify the default mode, dorsal attention, executive control, and salience networks. Compared to healthy subjects, individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated greater connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex, a key hub of the default mode, and the left inferior gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Interestingly, these regions were more strongly connected to the executive control network in healthy control subjects. In contrast to the default mode, patients demonstrated less connectivity in the executive control and dorsal attention networks. No differences were observed in the salience network. The results indicate that resting-state networks are differentially affected in schizophrenia. The alterations are characterized by reduced segregation between the default mode and executive control networks in the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe, and reduced connectivity in the dorsal attention and executive control networks. The changes suggest that the process of functional specialization is altered in schizophrenia. Further work is needed to determine if the alterations are related to disturbances in white matter connectivity, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and genetic risk for schizophrenia.",

    abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in large-scale memory and cognitive brain networks. Since the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, a number of studies have focused on this region of the brain. Yet it is clear that other regions of the large-scale episodic memory network are affected early in the disease as well, and fMRI has begun to illuminate functional abnormalities in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well in MCI and AD. Besides predictable hypoactivation of brain regions as they accrue pathology and undergo atrophy, there are also areas of hyperactivation in brain memory and cognitive circuits, possibly representing attempted compensatory activity. Recent fMRI data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. Additional work with "resting state" fMRI data is illuminating functional-anatomic brain circuits and their disruption by disease. As this work continues to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the incorporation of measures of task-related brain function into diagnostic assessment or therapeutic monitoring, which will hopefully one day be useful for demonstrating beneficial effects of treatments being tested in clinical trials.},

    abstract = "Slow wave sleep (SWS) is associated with spontaneous brain oscillations that are thought to participate in sleep homeostasis and to support the processing of information related to the experiences of the previous awake period. At the cellular level, during SWS, a slow oscillation (<1 Hz) synchronizes firing patterns in large neuronal populations and is reflected on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as large-amplitude, low-frequency waves. By using simultaneous EEG and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we characterized the transient changes in brain activity consistently associated with slow waves (>140 microV) and delta waves (75-140 microV) during SWS in 14 non-sleep-deprived normal human volunteers. Significant increases in activity were associated with these waves in several cortical areas, including the inferior frontal, medial prefrontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate areas. Compared with baseline activity, slow waves are associated with significant activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, and brainstem, whereas delta waves are related to frontal responses. No decrease in activity was observed. This study demonstrates that SWS is not a state of brain quiescence, but rather is an active state during which brain activity is consistently synchronized to the slow oscillation in specific cerebral regions. The partial overlap between the response pattern related to SWS waves and the waking default mode network is consistent with the fascinating hypothesis that brain responses synchronized by the slow oscillation restore microwake-like activity patterns that facilitate neuronal interactions",

The psychological correlate of high resting state neural activity in CMS remains however unclear though speculatively it has been associated with processing of internally-oriented self-relatedness. We used functional MRI to examine internally-oriented self-relatedness during the resting state period. This was indirectly done by letting subjects perceive emotional pictures followed by a fixation cross; the very same pictures were then rated subjectively according to their degree of self-relatedness in a postscanning session. This allowed us to correlate the picture ratings of self-relatedness with signal changes in the subsequent resting state period, i.e. fixation period. The emotional pictures' degree of self-relatedness parametrically modulated subsequent resting state signal changes in various CMS, including ventro- and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. This modulation could be distinguished from effects of emotion dimensions (e.g. valence, intensity) and evoked effects of self-relatedness during the stimulus period itself the latter being observed rather in subcortical regions, e.g. amygdala, ventral striatum, and tectum. In sum, our findings suggest that resting state neural activity in CMS is parametrically and specifically modulated by the preceding stimulus's degree of self-relatedness. This lends further support to the presumed involvement of these regions in processing internally-oriented self-relatedness as distinguished from externally-oriented self-relatedness",

The patients were further divided into two groups: patients with depressive symptoms and patients without; the patients then used a self-rating depression scale (SDS) to assess their depression. All participants underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans using the Trio Tim magnetic resonance (MR) image system (3.0 T). The data were processed and analyzed using REST and SPSS11.5 software.RESULTS: The patients with depressive symptoms showed significantly higher activity in the bilateral thalamus, insula and caudate and right anterior cingulate compared with the two other groups (p<0.05, corrected). Brain network connectivity analysis revealed that connectivity decreased in the prefrontal-limbic system and increased within the limbic system and angular gyrus in patients with depressive symptoms (p<0.05, corrected).CONCLUSION: The epilepsy patients with depressive symptoms showed regional brain activity alterations and disruption of the mood regulation network at the onset of seizures.

    abstract = "Older persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) feature neurobiological Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in 50\% to 70\% of the cases and develop dementia within the next 5 to 7 years. Current evidence suggests that biochemical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and neuropsychological markers can track the disease over time since the MCI stage (also called prodromal AD). The amount of evidence supporting their validity is of variable strength. We have reviewed the current literature and categorized evidence of validity into three classes: Class A, availability of multiple serial studies; Class B a single serial study or multiple cross sectional studies of patients with increasing disease severity from MCI to probable AD; and class C, multiple cross sectional studies of patients in the dementia stage, not including the MCI stage. Several Class A studies suggest that episodic memory and semantic fluency are the most reliable neuropsychological markers of progression. Hippocampal atrophy, ventricular volume and whole brain atrophy are structural MRI markers with class A evidence. Resting-state fMRI and connectivity, and diffusion MR markers in the medial temporal white matter (parahippocampus and posterior cingulum) and hippocampus are promising but require further validation. Change in amyloid load in MCI patients warrant further investigations, e.g. over longer period of time, to assess its value as marker of disease progression. Several spectral markers of resting state EEG rhythms that might reflect neurodegenerative processes in the prodromal stage of AD (EEG power density, functional coupling, spectral coherence, and synchronization) suffer from lack of appropriately designed studies. Although serial studies on late event-related potentials (ERPs) in healthy elders or MCI patients are inconclusive, others tracking disease progression and effects of cholinesterase inhibiting drugs in AD, and cross-sectional including MCI or predicting development of AD offer preliminary evidence of validity as a marker of disease progression from the MCI stage. CSF Markers, such as A$\beta$1-42, t-tau and p-tau are valuable markers which support the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, these markers are not sensitive to disease progression and cannot be used to monitor the severity of Alzheimer's disease. For Isoprostane F2 some evidence exists that its increase correlates with the progression and the severity of AD.",

Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition",

We sought to explore the continued influence of overt hepatic encephalopathy on neurological function by measuring brain resting-state inherent connectivity, based on an investigation of structural abnormalities. METHODS: Neuropsychological tests and structural and functional magnetic resonance scanning were conducted in 20 healthy controls and 21 cirrhotic patients with a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy. The analysis of voxel-based morphometry and functional connectivity were performed to detect the alterations in brain structure and function, respectively. RESULTS: Patients showed significantly worse performance in neuropsychological tests as compared with controls, despite apparently normal mental status. Analysis of voxel-based morphometry revealed a decrease in gray matter volume primarily in the midline regions, bilateral insular cortex and caudates, left parahippocampal gyrus, and right cerebellum posterior lobe, while the volume of the bilateral thalamus showed an increase. Of these regions, the posterior cingulate cortex with peak atrophy was selected as the origin for the analysis of functional connectivity. Typical patterns of a default mode network were identified in both groups. Decreased functional connectivity was found in the medial prefrontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and left middle temporal gyrus in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both functional and structural impairments were evident after apparent recovery from overt hepatic encephalopathy, demonstrating that brain dysfunction induced by hepatic encephalopathy persisted after clinical resolution and provided a basis for further evolution of the disease",

Our approach avoids the introduction of user-defined seed regions for the study of spontaneous activity. Unlike existing techniques, it yields a sparse representation of resting-state activity networks which can be characterized and investigated fairly easily in a semi-interactive fashion. We proceed in several steps, based on the idea that spectral coherence of the fMRI time courses in the low frequency band carries the information of interest. In particular, we address the question of building adapted representations of the data from the spectral coherence matrix. We analyze nine datasets taken from three subjects and show resting-state networks validated by EEG-fMRI simultaneous acquisition literature, with low intra-subject variability; we also discuss the merits of different (rapid/slow) fMRI acquisition schemes.",

    abstract = "Hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) has been frequently reported in studies of functional brain aging. It is commonly considered to be a plastic brain reorganization that provides compensation for declining unilateral neural efficiency. However, plastic functional alterations may also be associated with neural connectivity changes. Using activation and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we examined whether functional and structural connectivity related to prefrontal working memory function is asymmetrically reduced in the two hemispheres of the aging brain; and if yes, whether these asymmetric connectivity declines are correlated with asymmetry reduction in functional activation. With regions of interests defined by verbal working memory activations, it is revealed that although neural connectivity is generally reduced in the aging brain, prefrontal-parietal resting functional connectivity is better preserved in the left hemisphere while prefrontal DTI fiber pathways are better preserved in the right hemisphere. In addition, the laterality change of the functional activation is negatively correlated with that of the resting connectivity and positively correlated with that of the structural connectivity. These results reveal additional aspects of the neuronal alterations of aging and suggest a link between asymmetric connectivity reduction and HAROLD.",

Identification of cortical modules by differences in whole-brain connectivity profiles derived from diffusion tensor imaging or resting state correlations has already been shown. These approaches, however, carry no task-related information. Hence, inference on the functional relevance of the ensuing parcellation remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate, that Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling (MACM) allows the delineation of cortical modules based on their whole-brain co-activation pattern across databased neuroimaging results. Using a model free approach, two regions of the medial pre-motor cortex, SMA and pre-SMA were differentiated solely based on their functional connectivity. Assessing the behavioral domain and paradigm class meta-data of the experiments associated with the clusters derived from the co-activation based parcellation moreover allows the identification of their functional characteristics. The ensuing hypotheses about functional differentiation and distinct functional connectivity between pre-SMA and SMA were then explicitly tested and confirmed in independent datasets using functional and resting state fMRI. Co-activation based parcellation thus provides a new perspective for identifying modules of functional connectivity and linking them to functional properties, hereby generating new and subsequently testable hypotheses about the organization of cortical modules.",

Cocaine dependent individuals manifest alterations in reward functioning that may relate to changes induced by cocaine or to pre-existing differences related to vulnerability to addiction. The circuit level manifestations of these drug-induced plastic changes and predispositions to drug dependence are poorly understood in preclinical models and virtually unknown in human drug dependence. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis with 'seed voxels' placed within individual nodes of the MCL system, we report network-specific functional connectivity strength decreases in cocaine users within distinct circuits of the system, including between ventral tegmental area (VTA) and a region encompassing thalamus/lentiform nucleus/nucleus accumbens, between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and between hippocampus and dorsal mPFC. Further, regression analysis on regions showing significant functional connectivity decrease in chronic cocaine users revealed that the circuit strength between VTA and thalamus/lentiform nucleus/nucleus accumbens was negatively correlated with years of cocaine use. This is the first evidence of circuit-related changes in human cocaine dependence and is consistent with the range of cognitive and behavioral disruptions seen in cocaine dependence. As potential circuit level biomarkers of cocaine dependence, these circuit alterations may be usefully applied in treatment development and monitoring treatment outcome.",

This review paper presents strategies to improve the phenotypic definition of MDD by proposing imaging endophenotypes derived from magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures, such as cortical gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate/glutamine concentrations, and from measures of resting-state activity and functional connectivity. The proposed endophenotypes are discussed regarding specificity, mood state-independence, heritability, familiarity, clinical relevance and possible associations with candidate genes. By improving phenotypic definitions, the discovery of new imaging endophenotypes will increase the power of candidate gene and genome-wide associations studies. It will also help to develop and evaluate novel therapeutic treatments and enable clinicians to apply individually tailored therapeutic approaches. Finally, improvements of the phenotypic definition of MDD based on neuroimaging measures will contribute to a new classification system of mood disorders based on etiology and pathophysiology.",

Indeed, network analysis of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has identified abnormal metabolic networks associated with the cardinal motor symptoms of PD, such as akinesia and tremor, as well as PD-related cognitive dysfunction. More recent task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reproduced several of the altered connectivity patterns identified in these abnormal PD-related networks. A similar network analysis approach in dystonia revealed abnormal disease related metabolic patterns in both manifesting and non-manifesting carriers of dystonia mutations. Other multimodal imaging approaches using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging in patients with primary genetic dystonia suggest abnormal connectivity within the CbTC circuits mediate the clinical manifestations of this inherited neurodevelopmental disorder. Ongoing developments in functional imaging and future studies in early patients are likely to enhance our understanding of these movement disorders and guide novel targets for future therapies",

The second system, labeled intrinsic, overlaps substantially with the previously described "default-mode" network, and is likely associated with inner-oriented processing. This global partition of the cerebral cortex emerged from hemodynamic imaging data the analysis of which was constrained by pre-determined hypotheses. Here we applied a hypothesis-free, unsupervised two-class clustering algorithm (k-means) to a large set of fMRI data. The two clusters delineated by this unsupervised hypothesis-free procedure showed high anatomical consistency across individuals, and their cortical topography coincided largely with the previously determined extrinsic and intrinsic systems.

These analyses compare seed voxels' activity over time to the activity of other voxels over time and identify correlations between regions. This study is the first to perform functional connectivity analyses in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) at high enough resolution to resolve the hippocampal subfields. We calculated the average correlation coefficients between the MTL cortices, which include the entorhinal (ERC), perirhinal (PRC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and the hippocampal subfields dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum. We found that the hippocampal subfields had relatively high correlations with each other both within and across hemispheres, but did not have exceptionally strong correlations with the MTL cortices. The opposite was also seen where there was a relatively high correlation coefficient between the ERC and PRC, but both regions had low correlation coefficients with the hippocampal subfields. We also found greater functional connectivity within a hemisphere than across hemispheres. These effects were replicated across multiple datasets which differed in task demands, participants' age, and scanner sequence/slice acquisition. Notably, all datasets were better correlated to these patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity than to a model based on anatomical constraints. This is consistent with evidence that functional connectivity is not a direct mapping of anatomical connectivity. These patterns of functional connectivity imply a distinction between the MTL cortices and the hippocampus and speak to our understanding of the organization of the MTL. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

After applying ICA to the whole brain gray matter, we applied second-level ICA restrictively to the basal ganglia and the thalamus area to identify discrete functional subunits of those regions. As a result, the basal ganglia and the thalamus were parcelled into 31 functional subdivisions according to their temporal activity patterns. The extracted parcels showed functional network connectivity between hemispheres, between subdivisions of the basal ganglia and thalamus, and between the extracted subdivisions and cerebral functional components. Grossly, these findings correspond to cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits in the brain. This study also showed the utility of multilevel ICA of resting state fMRI in brain network research.

    title = "{Cross hippocampal influence in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy measured with high temporal resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging.}",
    abstract = "Purpose: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a chronic disorder with spontaneous seizures recurring for years, or even decades. Many structural and functional changes have been detected in both the seizure focus and distal regions throughout the brain over this duration that may reflect the development of epileptogenic networks. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity mapping has the potential to elucidate and quantify these networks. The network between the left and right hippocampus may very likely be one of the most susceptible to changes due to long-term seizure propagation effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify cross hippocampal influence in mTLE using high temporal resolution fMRI, and to determine its relationship with disease duration. Methods: fMRI images were acquired in the resting (interictal) state with 500 ms temporal resolution across the temporal lobes of 19 mTLE patients (13 left, 6 right). The left and right hippocampi were identified on each subject's images using both structurally defined and functionally defined boundaries. The cross hippocampal influence was quantified in two ways for each pair of regions: (1) the nondirectional hippocampal functional connectivity calculated as the Pearson's correlation between the average time series in the left and the right hippocampus regions, and (2) the Granger causality (GC) laterality measure, which implies directional influence by determining temporal precedence. Each of these measures was correlated with age, age of onset, and disease duration across subjects to investigate relationship to disease progression. Key Findings: The hippocampal connectivity was not significantly different between patients with left and right mTLE using either the structurally or the functionally defined regions. Across all patients, hippocampal connectivity was not correlated significantly with age of onset or duration of disease. However, as duration of disease increased after 10 years (nine patients), the hippocampal connectivity increased linearly. Using the functionally defined regions, the GC laterality was increased in the right mTLE over the left mTLE, indicating that the left hippocampus was influencing the right hippocampus more than the right influencing left. This was also positively correlated with age of onset. Furthermore, like hippocampal connectivity, the relationship between GC laterality and duration of disease changes after 10 years duration of disease. After this duration, the GC laterality was positive in the three of three patients with right mTLE (left influencing right), whereas the GC laterality was negative in five of six patients with left mTLE (right influencing left). Significance: This study reveals a relationship between fMRI functional connectivity and causal influence of the left and right hippocampi and duration of disease in mTLE. During the interictal state, the interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity initially is disrupted and then linearly increases as the epilepsy progresses longer than 10 years. This increase in connectivity appears to be due to the hippocampus contralateral to the epileptogenic focus exerting more influence over the ipsilateral hippocampus. These findings may have implications in understanding the functional development of epileptic networks and possibly prediction of surgical outcome of mTLE.",

The spontaneous BOLD activity shows organized anatomical specialization as well as disruption in a number of brain pathologies. The link between the spontaneous fMRI fluctuations and human behavior is therefore of acute interest and importance. Here we report that a highly significant correlation exists between spontaneous BOLD fluctuations and eye movements which occur subliminally and spontaneously in the absence of any visual stimulation. Of the various eye movement parameters tested, we found robust and anatomically consistent correlations with both the amplitude and velocity of spontaneous eye movements. Control experiments ruled out a contribution of spatial and visual attention as well as smooth pursuit eye movements to the effect. The consistent anatomical specificity of the correlation patterns and their tight temporal link at the proper hemodynamic delay argues against a non-neuronal explanation of the effect, such as cardiac or respiratory cycles. Our results thus demonstrate a link between resting state and spontaneously emerging subconscious oculo-motor behavior.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 Tesla on 20 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with minimal frontal cognitive dysfunction and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Resting-state network maps were extracted with independent component analysis and group-level statistical analyses were performed to detect disease and disease-by-age interaction effects. Whole-brain global and regional atrophy measures were obtained from same-session structural scans. The sensori-motor network showed significant disease effects, with signals suppressed in patients bilaterally in the primary motor cortex. The default-mode network showed a significant disease-by-age interaction in the posterior cingulate cortex, where signals correlated with age positively in patients and negatively in controls. Both disease and disease-by-age interaction effects were detected in the right fronto-parietal network. Although global atrophy did not show significant differences, regions of reduced gray matter volume were detected in patients compared with controls adjacent to regions of reduced functional connectivity. Our results confirm that resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in the sensori-motor network are suppressed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A similar suppression is evident in the right fronto-parietal network, possibly reflecting the patients' frontal dysfunction and right-lateralized patterns of regional atrophy. The interaction between disease and aging in the default-mode network unravels a possible mechanism of compensation between motor and extramotor systems emerging as a supplementary functional push to help motor disturbances.",

We studied the impact of multiple sclerosis, which leads to the severe disintegration of the central white matter, on functional connectivity patterns in spontaneous cortical activity. Using a data driven approach based on the strength of a salient pattern of cognitive pathology, we identified distinct networks that exhibit increases in functional connectivity despite the presence of strong and diffuse reductions of the central white-matter integrity. The default mode network emerged as a core target of these connectivity modulations, showing enhanced functional coupling in bilateral inferior parietal cortex, posterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex.

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate alterations in functional connectivity in the resting brain networks in healthy elderly volunteers and patients with mild, moderate, or severe Alzheimer Disease (AD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained. Forty-six patients with AD and 16 healthy elderly volunteers were prospectively examined. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect alterations in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional connectivity through a comparison of the healthy control group with three separate AD groups-mild, moderate, and severe AD. A temporal correlation method was used to obtain PCC connectivity maps. RESULTS: Dissociated functional connectivity between the PCC and a set of regions, including the visual cortices bilaterally, the inferior temporal cortex, the hippocampus, and especially the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus and/or cuneus, was observed in all AD groups. The disruption of connectivity intensified as the stage of AD progression increased. There were also regions that exhibited increased connectivity; these regions extended from left lateralized frontoparietal regions and spread to bilateral frontoparietal regions along with AD progression. CONCLUSION: Changes in PCC functional connectivity comprised bidirectional alterations in the resting networks in AD-affected brains, and the impaired resting functional connectivity seemed to change with AD progression. Therefore, alterations in functional connectivity in the default mode network might play a role in the progression of AD.",

We show how the average association objective formulated in the context of spectral graph clustering leads naturally to a clustering strategy where each system is assigned to at most one cluster. A residual set is formed of the systems that are not members of any cluster. Maximization of the average association objective leads to a discrete optimization problem, which is difficult to solve, but a relaxed version can be solved using an eigendecomposition of the connectivity matrix. A simple approach to extracting clusters from a relaxed solution is described and developed by applying a variance maximizing solution to the relaxed solution, which leads to a method with increased accuracy and sensitivity. Numerical studies of theoretical connectivity models and of synchronization clusters in a lattice of coupled Lorenz oscillators are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed approach. The method is applied to an experimentally obtained human resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset and the results are discussed.",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there are differences in brain connectivity in late-life depression (LLD) and nondepressed subjects using the left and right heads of caudate nuclei (hCN) as the seed regions. DESIGN: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected using a 3-Tesla MRI System. SETTING: Subjects were recruited from primary or secondary care services in the Newcastle area. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three subjects aged 65 years and older; 16 who had a recent episode of LLD and 17 nondepressed subjects. MEASUREMENTS: Functional connectivity was analyzed by extracting the temporal signal variation from the left and right hCN and cross correlating with the rest of the brain. RESULTS: Significant connectivity between the hCN and frontal areas was observed in the nondepressed group, whereas in LLD, connectivity was seen over a much wider area. Regions showing significantly greater connectivity (p < or =0.05) in LLD compared with the nondepressed group were frontal (precentral, subgyral, middle frontal, and paracentral lobule), sublobar (thalamus and insula), limbic (cingulate), parietal (postcentral gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus), and temporal (superior temporal gyrus). Conversely, no brain regions showed greater connectivity in the nondepressed group than LLD. In both groups, the right hCN showed significantly greater connectivity than the left in numerous brain regions, but connectivity for the left hCN did not exceed the right in any brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: This resting-state study showed increased connectivity in specific brain regions in LLD compared with the nondepressed group, which supports the view that functional connectivity is altered in depression.",

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have also demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls",

    abstract = "Brain regions simultaneously activated during any cognitive process are functionally connected, forming large-scale networks. These functional networks can be examined during active conditions [i.e., task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)] and also in passive states (resting-fMRI), where the default mode network (DMN) is the most widely investigated system. The role of the DMN remains unclear, although it is known to be responsible for the shift between resting and focused attention processing. There is also some evidence for its malleability in relation to previous experience. Here we investigated brain connectivity patterns in 16 healthy young subjects by using an n-back task with increasing levels of memory load within the fMRI context. Prior to this working memory (WM) task, participants were trained outside fMRI with a shortened test version. Immediately after, they underwent a resting-state fMRI acquisition followed by the full fMRI n-back test. We observed that the degree of intrinsic correlation within DMN and WM networks was maximal during the most demanding n-back condition (3-back). Furthermore, individuals showing a stronger negative correlation between the two networks under both conditions exhibited better behavioural performance. Interestingly, and despite the fact that we considered eight different resting-state fMRI networks previously identified in humans, only the connectivity within the posteromedial parts of the DMN (precuneus) prior to the fMRI n-back task predicted WM execution. Our results using a data-driven probabilistic approach for fMRI analysis provide the first evidence of a direct relationship between behavioural performance and the degree of negative correlation between the DMN and WM networks. They further suggest that in the context of expectancy for an imminent cognitive challenge, higher resting-state activity in the posteromedial parietal cortex may be related to increased attentional preparatory resources.",

The functional correlates of the structural changes detected using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry have not been extensively studied. A group of 25 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was compared to healthy control subjects using a multi-modal neuroimaging approach comprising T(1)-weighted, diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using probabilistic tractography, a grey matter connection network was defined based upon the prominent corticospinal tract and corpus callosum involvement demonstrated by white matter tract-based spatial statistics. This 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-specific' network included motor, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, pars opercularis and motor-related thalamic nuclei. A novel analysis protocol, using this disease-specific grey matter network as an input for a dual-regression analysis, was then used to assess changes in functional connectivity directly associated with this network. A spatial pattern of increased functional connectivity spanning sensorimotor, premotor, prefrontal and thalamic regions was found. A composite of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures also allowed the qualitative discrimination of patients from controls. An integrated structural and functional connectivity approach therefore identified apparently dichotomous processes characterizing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cerebral network failure, in which there was increased functional connectivity within regions of decreased structural connectivity. Patients with slower rates of disease progression showed connectivity measures with values closer to healthy controls, raising the possibility that functional connectivity increases might not simply represent a physiological compensation to reduced structural integrity. One alternative possibility is that increased functional connectivity reflects a progressive loss of inhibitory cortical influence as part of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis, which might then have relevance to future therapeutic strategies.",

Functional studies have identified changes in functional connectivity among several key areas involved in mood regulation. Few studies have combined structural and functional imaging. In this study we sought to examine the relationship between the uncinate fasciculus, a key fronto-temporal tract and resting state functional connectivity between the ventral prefrontal cortex ((PFC) and limbic and striatal areas. METHODS: The sample consisted of 24 older patients remitted from unipolar major depression. Each participant had a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan using standardized protocols to obtain both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity data. Our statistical approach compared structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus and functional connectivity data. RESULTS: We found positive correlations between left uncinate fasciculus (UF) fractional anisotropy (FA) and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the left ventrolateral PFC and left amygdala and between the left ventrolateral PFC and the left hippocampus. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between left ventromedial PFC-caudate rsFC and left UF FA. The right UF FA did not correlate with any of the seed region based connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the notion that resting state functional connectivity reflects structural integrity, since the ventral PFC is structurally connected to temporal regions by the UF. Future studies should include larger samples of patients and healthy comparison subjects in which both resting state and task-based functional connectivity are examined",

We employed network-based analyses of "resting state" functional neuroimaging data to ascertain group differences in the endogenous cortical activity between healthy and depressed subjects.We additionally sought to use machine learning techniques to explore the ability of these network-based measures of resting state activity to provide diagnostic information for depression. Resting state fMRI data were acquired from twenty two depressed outpatients and twenty two healthy subjects matched for age and gender. These data were anatomically parcellated and functional connectivity matrices were then derived using the linear correlations between the BOLD signal fluctuations of all pairs of cortical and subcortical regions.We characterised the hierarchical organization of these matrices using network-based matrics, with an emphasis on their mid-scale "modularity" arrangement. Whilst whole brain measures of organization did not differ between groups, a significant rearrangement of their community structure was observed. Furthermore we were able to classify individuals with a high level of accuracy using a support vector machine, primarily through the use of a modularity-based metric known as the participation index.In conclusion, the application of machine learning techniques to features of resting state fMRI network activity shows promising potential to assist in the diagnosis of major depression, now suggesting the need for validation in independent data sets},

    abstract = "Spatial Independent Component Analysis (ICA) decomposes the time by space functional MRI (fMRI) matrix into a set of 1-D basis time courses and their associated 3-D spatial maps that are optimized for mutual independence. When applied to resting state fMRI (rsfMRI), ICA produces several spatial independent components (ICs) that seem to have biological relevance - the so-called resting state networks (RSNs). The ICA problem is well posed when the true data generating process follows a linear mixture of ICs model in terms of the identifiability of the mixing matrix. However, the contrast function used for promoting mutual independence in ICA is dependent on the finite amount of observed data and is potentially non-convex with multiple local minima. Hence, each run of ICA could produce potentially different IC estimates even for the same data. One technique to deal with this run-to-run variability of ICA was proposed by [1] in their algorithm RAICAR which allows for the selection of only those ICs that have a high run-to-run reproducibility. We propose an enhancement to the original RAICAR algorithm that enables us to assign reproducibility [Formula: see text]-values to each IC and allows for an objective assessment of both within subject and across subjects reproducibility. We call the resulting algorithm RAICAR-N (N stands for null hypothesis test), and we have applied it to publicly available human rsfMRI data (http://www.nitrc.org). Our reproducibility analyses indicated that many of the published RSNs in rsfMRI literature are highly reproducible. However, we found several other RSNs that are highly reproducible but not frequently listed in the literature",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brain areas interact mutually to perform particular complex brain functions such as memory or language. Furthermore, under resting-state conditions several spatial patterns have been identified that resemble functional systems involved in cognitive functions. Among these, the default-mode network (DMN), which is consistently deactivated during task periods and is related to a variety of cognitive functions, has attracted most attention. In addition, in resting-state conditions some brain areas engaged in focused attention (such as the anticorrelated network, AN) show a strong negative correlation with DMN; as task demand increases, AN activity rises, and DMN activity falls. OBJECTIVE: We combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate these brain network dynamics. METHODS: Ten healthy young volunteers underwent four blocks of resting-state fMRI (10-minutes), each of them immediately after 20 minutes of sham or active tDCS (2 mA), on two different days. On the first day the anodal electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (part of the AN) with the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital area, and on the second day, the electrode arrangement was reversed (anode right-DLPFC, cathode left-supraorbital). RESULTS: After active stimulation, functional network connectivity revealed increased synchrony within the AN components and reduced synchrony in the DMN components. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a reconfiguration of intrinsic brain activity networks after active tDCS. These effects may help to explain earlier reports of improvements in cognitive functions after anodal-tDCS, where increasing cortical excitability may have facilitated reconfiguration of functional brain networks to address upcoming cognitive demands.",

However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in "default mode network" previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD.},

Numerous analytical options are available, including model-driven ROI-based correlation analysis and model-free, independent component analysis (ICA). High test-retest reliability will be a necessary feature of a successful ICN biomarker, yet available reliability data remains limited. Here, we examined ICN fMRI test-retest reliability in 24 healthy older subjects scanned roughly one year apart. We focused on the salience network, a disease-relevant ICN not previously subjected to reliability analysis, as well as the default mode network. Most ICN analytical methods proved reliable (intraclass coefficients>0.4) and were further improved by wavelet analysis. Seed-based ROI correlation analysis showed high scan-wise reliability, whereas graph theoretical analysis and temporal concatenation group ICA proved most reliable at the individual unit-wise level (voxels, ROIs). Including global signal regression in ROI-based correlation analyses reduced reliability. Our study provides a direct comparison between the most commonly used ICN fMRI methods and potential guidelines for measuring intrinsic connectivity in aging control and patient populations over time},

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired 10 days after a first stroke in 24 patients without a history of psychiatric illness. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the DMN in each subject. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) 17 and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) were recorded 10 days and 3 months after the stroke. Associations between severity of anxiety or depression symptoms and DMN functional connectivity were investigated with whole-brain analyses by using statistical parametric mapping software and were adjusted for age, sex, manual laterality, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity scores. Correlations were considered significant if P<.001, with a cluster size of more than 50 voxels.RESULTS: Ten days after stroke, anxiety severity was correlated with functional connectivity in the middle temporal cortex and the anterior midcingulate cortex, while at 3 months after stroke, a correlation was observed with the middle temporal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. Poststroke depressive symptom severity did not correlate with functional connectivity changes at 10-day follow-up, while the HDRS 17 score was correlated with functional connectivity in the left middle temporal cortex and precuneus at 3-month follow-up.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a dysfunction of DMN functional connectivity involved in emotional control is associated with the severity of poststroke depression. Further studies are necessary to determine the mechanisms of this functional impairment",

Using a multi-level analysis of spontaneous low-frequency fMRI data stretching from the activity of individual brain regions to the coordinated connectivity pattern of the whole brain, we investigate the role of brain signal complexity in schizophrenia. Specifically, we quantitatively characterize the univariate wavelet entropy of regional activity, the bivariate pairwise functional connectivity between regions, and the multivariate network organization of connectivity patterns. Our results indicate that univariate measures of complexity are less sensitive to disease state than higher level bivariate and multivariate measures. While wavelet entropy is unaffected by disease state, the magnitude of pairwise functional connectivity is significantly decreased in schizophrenia and the variance is increased. Furthermore, by considering the network structure as a function of correlation strength, we find that network organization specifically of weak connections is strongly correlated with attention, memory, and negative symptom scores and displays potential as a clinical biomarker, providing up to 75\% classification accuracy and 85\% sensitivity. We also develop a general statistical framework for the testing of group differences in network properties, which is broadly applicable to studies where changes in network organization are crucial to the understanding of brain function. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Extensions to a group-level suffer from the drawback of evaluating single-subject resting-state components of interest either using a predefined spatial template or via visual inspection. FENICA introduced in the context of group ICA methods is based solely on spatially consistency across subjects directly reflecting similar networks. Therefore, group data can be processed without further visual inspection of the single-subject components or the definition of a template (Sch\"{o}pf et al., 2009). In this study FENICA was applied to fMRI resting-state data from 28 healthy subjects resulting in eight group RSNs. These RSNs resemble the spatial patterns of the following previously described networks: (1) visual network, (2) default mode network, (3) sensorimotor network, (4) dorsolateral prefrontal network, (5) temporal prefrontal network, (6) basal ganglia network, (7) auditory processing network, and (8) working memory network. This novel analysis approach for identifying spatially consistent networks across a group of subjects does not require manual or template-based selection of single-subject components and, therefore, offers a truly explorative procedure of assessing RSNs.},

While these investigations have typically focused on activity in isolated regions of the brain, resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging allow for more integrative assessments of spatially disparate neural networks. The novel contribution of the current study is to combine both resting state functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging to examine motor corticocortical circuits in young and older adults. We find that relatively greater functional connectivity between the primary motor cortices was strongly associated with decreased structural connectivity and poorer motor performance solely in older adults. We suggest that greater functional connectivity in older adults may be reflective of a release from the normally predominantly inhibitory interhemispheric communication associated with the primary motor cortices",

A critical first step in the design of innovative treatments for chronic pain is the development of new methods to evaluate pain and the cerebral 'signature' for its perception and modulation, and in so doing, be able to monitor the effect of new therapies on pain in an objective fashion.METHODS: : Subjects with fully implanted thoracic epidural spinal cord stimulator (SCS) for the treatment of chronic refractory neuropathic leg pain underwent resting state functional MRI scans with the SCS in the OFF and ON states. Pain quantification was based on the Visual-Analog Scale (VAS). Images were acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI system. Prior to the study, a detailed safety assessment of the devices to be used in the MRI field in this study was performed. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated using the Fourier transform of the temporal data. Seed-based correlation analysis was used to assess the functional connectivity.RESULTS: : We demonstrated that spinal cord stimulation was associated with significant changes in ALFF in patients undergoing resting state fMRI. The changes were more prominent in the region of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, nucleus accumbens and amygdala (Figures 1a, 1b). Seed-based analysis of similarity coefficients in ALFF for the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, nucleus accumbens and amygdale showed quantifiable changes in these regions with the SCS in the OFF state compared to the ON states at stimulation parameters associated with optimal pain reduction, paresthesia perception and discomfort (Figure 2a-d).CONCLUSION: : Resting state fMRI in patients receiving spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic leg pain showed robust, consistent and quantifiable changes in the ALFF in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Large-amplitude, spatially correlated fluctuations in resting state fMRI signals may be a neuroimaging surrogate for higher order pain perception and its modulation",

An emerging field is examining the human connectome, including networks of brain regions that are not only temporally-correlated during different task conditions, but also networks that show highly correlated spontaneous activity during a task-free state. Both task-related and task-free network activity has been associated with individual task performance and behavior under certain conditions. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether sex differences exist during a task-free resting state for two networks associated with cognitive task performance (executive control network (ECN), salience network (SN)) and the default mode network (DMN). Forty-nine healthy subjects (26 females, 23 males) underwent a 5-min task-free fMRI scan in a 3T MRI. An independent components analysis (ICA) was performed to identify the best-fit IC for each network based on specific spatial nodes defined in previous studies. To determine the consistency of these networks across subjects we performed self-organizing group-level ICA analyses. There were no significant differences between sexes in the functional connectivity of the brain areas within the ECN, SN, or the DMN. These important findings highlight the robustness of intrinsic connectivity of these resting state networks and their similarity between sexes. Furthermore, our findings suggest that resting state fMRI studies do not need to be controlled for sex.",

In the current study, we used a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method to investigate NMO-related modulations of neural activity in the resting state. METHODS: Resting-state fMRIs acquired in 17 NMO patients as well as in 17 age- and sex-matched normal controls were compared. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used to measure the regional homogeneity. Correlative analyses were performed to explore the relationship between the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), disease duration and ReHo in regions with significant group differences. RESULTS: Comparing the NMO group with the healthy controls, we found ReHo decreased in extensive brain regions, including the left anterior cingulate, left medial frontal gyrus, left posterior cingulate, right precuneus and right middle temporal gyrus; and increased in the right inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that neural activity in the resting state is changed in patients with NMO. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study reveals clear abnormalities of NMO patients in the baseline activities that have not been well detected, and further improves our understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in NMO patients.",

The most strongly left lateralized cerebellar regions were located in lobules VI and VIII in regions linked to distinct cerebral association networks. Comparing cerebellar asymmetry with independently estimated cerebral asymmetry revealed that the lateralized regions of the cerebellum belong to the same networks that are strongly lateralized in the cerebrum. The degree of functional asymmetry of the cerebellum across individuals was significantly correlated with cerebral asymmetry and varied with handedness. In addition, cerebellar asymmetry estimated at rest predicted cerebral lateralization during an active language task.

The amygdala is a brain structure that plays a pivotal role in emotion-related functions. Investigating developmental characteristics of the amygdala and associated functional circuits in children is important for understanding how emotion processing matures in the developing brain. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) are two major amygdalar nuclei that contribute to distinct functions via their unique pattern of interactions with cortical and subcortical regions. Almost nothing is currently known about the maturation of functional circuits associated with these amygdala nuclei in the developing brain. Using intrinsic connectivity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we investigated developmental changes in functional connectivity of the BLA and CMA in twenty-four 7- to 9-y-old typically developing children compared with twenty-four 19- to 22-y-old healthy adults. Children showed significantly weaker intrinsic functional connectivity of the amygdala with subcortical, paralimbic, and limbic structures, polymodal association, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, target networks associated with the BLA and CMA exhibited greater overlap and weaker dissociation in children. In line with this finding, children showed greater intraamygdala connectivity between the BLA and CMA. Critically, these developmental differences were reproducibly identified in a second independent cohort of adults and children. Taken together, our findings point toward weak integration and segregation of amygdala circuits in young children. These immature patterns of amygdala connectivity have important implications for understanding typical and atypical development of emotion-related brain circuitry",

Functional synchrony was defined and quantified as the mean of the cross-correlation coefficients of spontaneous low frequency (COSLOF) components between possible pairs of voxel time courses in a brain region, or the COSLOF index. The two-tailed Student t test was used to determine differences in the COSLOF index between the control group, the probable AD group, and the MCI group. An operating characteristic curve was calculated to graphically depict the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity of the COSLOF index.RESULTS: Functional synchrony quantified with the COSLOF index was obtained in AD, MCI, and control subjects. COSLOF index values were significantly lower in AD patients than in control subjects (t = 4.32, P <.0012). For MCI subjects, COSLOF index values were significantly higher than those of AD patients (t = -2.4052, P <.047) but significantly lower than those of control subjects (t = 2.257, P <.043). The exponential-class curve significantly fits the relationship between the COSLOF index and the Mini-Mental Status Examination score (chi(2) = 20.4), indicating the rapid decrease in cognitive capacity below a threshold of the COSLOF index.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the COSLOF index could be used as a noninvasive quantitative marker for the preclinical stage of AD.",

    abstract = {Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline. Functions such as attention, information processing, and working memory are compromised. It has been hypothesized that not only regional changes, but also alterations in the integration of regional brain activity (functional brain connectivity) underlie the observed age-related deficits. Here, we examined the functional properties of brain networks based on spontaneous fluctuations within brain systems using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized that functional connectivity of intrinsic brain activity in the "default-mode" network (DMN) is affected by normal aging and that this relates to cognitive function. Ten younger and 22 older subjects were scanned at "rest," that is, lying awake with eyes closed. Our results show decreased activity in older versus younger subjects in 2 resting-state networks (RSNs) resembling the previously described DMN, containing the superior and middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate, middle temporal gyrus, and the superior parietal region. These results remain significant after correction for RSN-specific gray matter volume. The relevance of these findings is illustrated by the correlation between reduced activity of one of these RSNs and less effective executive functioning/processing speed in the older group.},

    abstract = "Recently, a functional disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed for the physiological explanation of behavioral syndromes of this complex mental disorder. In this paper, we aim at further examining whether syndromes of schizophrenia could be decoded by some special spatiotemporal patterns of resting-state functional connectivity. We designed a data-driven classifier based on machine learning to extract highly discriminative functional connectivity features and to discriminate schizophrenic patients from healthy controls. The proposed classifier consisted of two separate steps. First, we used feature selection based on a correlation coefficient method to extract highly discriminative regions and construct the optimal feature set for classification. Then, an unsupervised-learning classifier combining low-dimensional embedding and self-organized clustering of fMRI was trained to discriminate schizophrenic patients from healthy controls. The performance of the classifier was tested using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The experimental results demonstrated not only high classification accuracy (93.75\% for schizophrenic patients, 75.0\% for healthy controls), but also good generalization and stability with respect to the number of extracted features. In addition, some functional connectivities between certain brain regions of the cerebellum and frontal cortex were found to exhibit the highest discriminative power, which might provide further evidence for the cognitive dysmetria hypothesis of schizophrenia. This primary study demonstrated that machine learning could extract exciting new information from the resting-state activity of a brain with schizophrenia, which might have potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of schizophrenia.",

In this study the effects of sustained cognitive performance on subsequent RS FC were investigated in healthy young (25-30 years; n=15) and middle-aged (50-60 years; n=14) male schoolteachers. Participants were scanned (functional magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) after a cognitively demanding and a control intervention (randomized tester-blind within-subject design). Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to decompose the data into spatially independent networks. This study focused on the executive control (ExN), the left and right frontoparietal (FPN), and the default mode network (DMN). The effects of cognitive performance and age were calculated with a full-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). A main effect of age was found in the left inferior frontal gyrus for the ExN and in the middle frontal gyrus for the DMN with middle-aged teachers having reduced RS FC. Sustained cognitive performance increased subsequent RS FC between the ExN and a lingual/parahippocampal cluster, and between the left FPN and a right calcarine/precuneus cluster. In these clusters, FC strength correlated positively with the perceived amount of effort during the intervention. Further, sustained cognitive performance affected subsequent RS FC between the ExN and the right temporal superior gyrus differently in young and middle-aged men. The results suggest that effects of age on RS FC are already present at middle age. Sustained cognitive performance increased RS FC between task-positive networks and other brain regions, although a change in RS FC within the networks was not found",

After 6 weeks of sertraline treatment resting state, functional connectivity between the ACC and limbic regions increased while limbic activation in response to negative versus neutral pictures decreased.

    title = "{Global and System-Specific Resting-State fMRI Fluctuations Are Uncorrelated: Principal Component Analysis Reveals Anti-Correlated Networks.}",
    abstract = "Abstract The influence of the global average signal (GAS) on functional-magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based resting-state functional connectivity is a matter of ongoing debate. The global average fluctuations increase the correlation between functional systems beyond the correlation that reflects their specific functional connectivity. Hence, removal of the GAS is a common practice for facilitating the observation of network-specific functional connectivity. This strategy relies on the implicit assumption of a linear-additive model according to which global fluctuations, irrespective of their origin, and network-specific fluctuations are super-positioned. However, removal of the GAS introduces spurious negative correlations between functional systems, bringing into question the validity of previous findings of negative correlations between fluctuations in the default-mode and the task-positive networks. Here we present an alternative method for estimating global fluctuations, immune to the complications associated with the GAS. Principal components analysis was applied to resting-state fMRI time-series. A global-signal effect estimator was defined as the principal component (PC) that correlated best with the GAS. The mean correlation coefficient between our proposed PC-based global effect estimator and the GAS was 0.97±0.05, demonstrating that our estimator successfully approximated the GAS. In 66 out of 68 runs, the PC that showed the highest correlation with the GAS was the first PC. Since PCs are orthogonal, our method provides an estimator of the global fluctuations, which is uncorrelated to the remaining, network-specific fluctuations. Moreover, unlike the regression of the GAS, the regression of the PC-based global effect estimator does not introduce spurious anti-correlations beyond the decrease in seed-based correlation values allowed by the assumed additive model. After regressing this PC-based estimator out of the original time-series, we observed robust anti-correlations between resting-state fluctuations in the default-mode and the task-positive networks. We conclude that resting-state global fluctuations and network-specific fluctuations are uncorrelated, supporting a Resting-State Linear-Additive Model. In addition, we conclude that the network-specific resting-state fluctuations of the default-mode and task-positive networks show artifact-free anti-correlations",

Fifteen participants who experienced acute traumatic events underwent a 7.3-min resting functional magnetic resonance imaging scan within 2 days post-event. All the patients were diagnosed with PTSD within 1 to 6 months after trauma. Brain areas in which activity was correlated with that of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were assessed. To assess the relationship between the severity of PTSD symptoms and PCC connectivity, contrast images representing areas positively correlated with the PCC were correlated with the subject's Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores (CAPS) when they were diagnosed. Furthermore, the PCC, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala were selected to assess the correlation of the strength of functional connectivity with the CAPS. Resting state connectivity with the PCC was negatively correlated with CAPS scores in the left superior temporal gyrus and right hippocampus/amygdala. Furthermore, the strength of connectivity between the PCC and bilateral amygdala, and even between the bilateral amygdala could predict the severity of PTSD symptoms later. These results suggest that early altered resting-state functional connectivity of the PCC with the left superior temporal gyrus, right hippocampus and amygdala could predict the severity of the disease and may be a major risk factor that predisposes patients to develop PTSD",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate changes in hippocampal functional connectivity and structural measures of hippocampal damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with intact spatial memory, a cognitive domain frequently affected in progressive MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics review board; all subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation. Twenty-five MS patients with intact spatial memory function were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched controls. Hippocampal volume differences, based on manually drawn masks, were evaluated by using the Student t test. Additionally, focal hippocampal lesions and mean diffusivity were obtained as descriptive measures of structural hippocampal damage. Multiple regression analyses of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data were performed for each subject by using hippocampal time series. Between-group analyses were conducted with a mixed-effects model, corrected for multiple comparisons by a cluster defining threshold level of z = 2 and a corrected cluster size significance level of P < .05. RESULTS: Right hippocampal volume was significantly lower in MS patients as compared with controls (P < .01). Left hippocampal volume was also lower in MS patients compared with controls, but not significantly so (P = .09). Resting-state functional connectivity between the hippocampus and its anatomic input or target areas, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex, were significantly decreased in MS patients. Decreased hippocampal functional connectivity was more pronounced in a subgroup of MS patients with hippocampal atrophy, although subtle decreases of functional connectivity were also found in patients with normal hippocampal volume. CONCLUSION: In MS patients, substantial abnormalities of hippocampal functional connectivity are already present before spatial memory function is impaired, especially in those patients with more pronounced hippocampal atrophy. Longitudinal studies should now assess whether these functional connectivity and structural changes may precede memory impairment in MS.",

Insight into underlying mechanisms would help to develop therapeutic strategies.OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of cognitive performance to patterns of nodal centrality derived from magneto-encephalography (MEG).METHODS: 34 early relapsing-remitting MS patients (median EDSS 2.0) and 28 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) had a MEG, a neuropsychological assessment and structural MRI. Resting-state functional connectivity was determined by the synchronization likelihood. Eigenvector Centrality (EC) was used to quantify for each sensor its connectivity and importance within the network. A cognition-score was calculated, and normalized grey and white matter volumes were determined. EC was compared per sensor and frequency band between groups using permutation testing, and related to cognition.RESULTS: Patients had lower grey and white matter volumes than HC, male patients lower cognitive performance than female patients. In HC, EC distribution showed highest nodal centrality over bi-parietal sensors ("hubs"). In patients, nodal centrality was even higher bi-parietally (theta-band) but markedly lower left temporally (upper alpha- and beta-band). Lower cognitive performance correlated to decreased nodal centrality over left temporal (lower alpha-band) and right temporal (beta-band) sensors, and to increased nodal centrality over right parieto-temporal sensors (beta-band). Network changes were most pronounced in male patients.CONCLUSIONS: Partial functional disconnection of the temporal regions was associated with cognitive dysfunction in MS; increased centrality in parietal hubs may reflect a shift from temporal to possibly less efficient parietal processing. To better understand patterns and dynamics of these network changes, longitudinal studies are warranted, also addressing the influence of gender},

Time scales are thought to be nested within distinct spatial scales, so that whereas fast oscillations may integrate local networks, slow oscillations might integrate computations across distributed brain areas. We here describe a newly developed approach that provides potential for the further substantiation of this hypothesis in future studies. We demonstrate the feasibility and important caveats of a novel wavelet-based means of relating time series of three-dimensional spatial variance (energy) of fMRI data to time series of temporal variance of EEG. The spatial variance of fMRI data was determined by employing the three-dimensional dual-tree complex wavelet transform. The temporal variance of EEG data was estimated by using traditional continuous complex wavelets. We tested our algorithm on artificial signals with known signal-to-noise ratios and on empirical resting state EEG-fMRI data obtained from four healthy human subjects. By employing the human posterior alpha rhythm as an exemplar, we demonstrated face validity of the approach. We believe that the proposed method can serve as a suitable tool for future research on the spatiotemporal properties of brain dynamics, hence moving beyond analyses based exclusively in one domain or the other.",

While previous research, including studies of priming, divided visual field presentation, and split-brain patients, demonstrates a general pattern of right/left asymmetry of form-specific versus form-abstract visual processing, little is known about brain organization underlying this dissociation. Here, using repetition priming of complex visual scenes and high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we demonstrate asymmetrical form specificity of visual processing between the right and left hemispheres within a region known to be critical for processing of visual spatial scenes (parahippocampal place area [PPA]). Next, we use resting-state functional connectivity MRI analyses to demonstrate that this functional asymmetry is associated with differential intrinsic activity correlations of the right versus left PPA with regions critically involved in perceptual versus conceptual processing, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the PPA comprises lateralized subregions across the cerebral hemispheres that are engaged in functionally dissociable yet complementary components of visual scene analysis. Furthermore, this functional asymmetry is associated with differential intrinsic functional connectivity of the PPA with distinct brain areas known to mediate dissociable cognitive processes.",

    abstract = "Recent studies suggest that childhood sexual abuse (CSA) elicits a cascade of neurohumoral events that affect brain development and is also a risk factor for the later development of substance abuse. We hypothesize that the cerebellar vermis may be a key region linking these observations. The vermis has a protracted ontogeny and a high density of glucocorticoid receptors, rendering it highly susceptible to early stress. The vermis modulates dopamine turnover in the accumbens and receives direct dopamine input through fibers with dopamine transporters. To test this hypothesis, steady-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (T2 relaxometry) was performed to assess resting blood flow in the vermis of 24 young adults (18-22 years) selected by screening from a large community sample. Eight subjects had a history of repeated CSA but were unmedicated and not under psychiatric care. Sixteen subjects were age-matched controls who had no personal or family history of Axis I psychiatric disorders. All subjects were screened to exclude known abnormalities affecting brain development, and any history of drug or alcohol abuse. CSA subjects had higher T2 relaxation time (T2-RT) than controls in the vermis but not in cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres. Vermal T2-RT correlated strongly with Limbic System Checklist (LSCL-33) ratings of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)-like symptomatology. From 537 prescreened young adults we found that their frequency of substance use was associated with a monotonic increase in LSCL-33 ratings and depression scores. Together these findings suggest that early trauma may interfere with the development of the vermis, and produce neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with drug use.",

    abstract = "Low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI signal have been used to map several consistent resting state networks in the brain. Using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed region, functional connectivity analyses have found not only positive correlations in the default mode network but negative correlations in another resting state network related to attentional processes. The interpretation is that the human brain is intrinsically organized into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks. Global variations of the BOLD signal are often considered nuisance effects and are commonly removed using a general linear model (GLM) technique. This global signal regression method has been shown to introduce negative activation measures in standard fMRI analyses. The topic of this paper is whether such a correction technique could be the cause of anti-correlated resting state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Here we show that, after global signal regression, correlation values to a seed voxel must sum to a negative value. Simulations also show that small phase differences between regions can lead to spurious negative correlation values. A combination breath holding and visual task demonstrates that the relative phase of global and local signals can affect connectivity measures and that, experimentally, global signal regression leads to bell-shaped correlation value distributions, centred on zero. Finally, analyses of negatively correlated networks in resting state data show that global signal regression is most likely the cause of anti-correlations. These results call into question the interpretation of negatively correlated regions in the brain when using global signal regression as an initial processing step.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major public health concern. It has been suggested that the brain's default network may provide a crucial avenue for understanding the neurobiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Evaluations of the default network have increased over recent years with the applied technique of resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI). These investigations have established that spontaneous activity in this network is highly correlated at rest in young adult populations. This coherence seems to be reduced in adults with ADHD. This is an intriguing finding, as coherence in spontaneous activity within the default network strengthens with age. Thus, the pathophysiology of ADHD might include delayed or disrupted maturation of the default network. If so, it is important to determine whether an altered developmental picture can be detected using rs-fcMRI in children with ADHD. METHODS: This study used the typical developmental context provided previously by Fair et al. (2008) to examine coherence of brain activity within the default network using rs-fcMRI in children with (n = 23) and without attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 23). RESULTS: We found that functional connections previously shown as developmentally dynamic in the default network were atypical in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder-consistent with perturbation or failure of the maturational processes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that atypical consolidation of this network over development plays a role in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",

    abstract = "In EEG/fMRI correlation studies it is common to consider the fMRI BOLD as filtered version of the EEG alpha power. Here the question is addressed whether other EEG frequency components may affect the correlation between alpha and BOLD. This was done comparing the statistical parametric maps (SPMs) of three different filter models wherein either the free or the standard hemodynamic response functions (HRF) were used in combination with the full spectral bandwidth of the EEG. EEG and fMRI were co-registered in a 30 min resting state condition in 15 healthy young subjects. Power variations in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were extracted from the EEG and used as regressors in a general linear model. Statistical parametric maps (SPMs) were computed using three different filter models, wherein either the free or the standard hemodynamic response functions (HRF) were used in combination with the full spectral bandwidth of the EEG. Results show that the SPMs of different EEG frequency bands, when significant, are very similar to that of the alpha rhythm. This is true in particular for the beta band, despite the fact that the alpha harmonics were discarded. It is shown that inclusion of EEG frequency bands as confounder in the fMRI-alpha correlation model has a large effect on the resulting SPM, in particular when for each frequency band the HRF is extracted from the data. We conclude that power fluctuations of different EEG frequency bands are mutually highly correlated, and that a multi frequency model is required to extract the SPM of the frequency of interest from EEG/fMRI data. When no constraints are put on the shapes of the HRFs of the nuisance frequencies, the correlation model looses so much statistical power that no correlations can be detected.",

However, activation sources are typically assumed to be linearly mixed, although non-linear properties of fMRI data, including resting-state data, have been observed. In this work, the non-linear locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm is introduced for dimensionality reduction of fMRI time series data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LLE performance was optimised and tested using simulated and volunteer data for task-evoked responses. LLE was compared with principal component analysis (PCA) as a preprocessing step to independent component analysis (ICA). Using an example data set with known non-linear properties, LLE-ICA was compared with PCA-ICA and non-linear PCA-ICA. A resting-state data set was analysed to compare LLE-ICA and PCA-ICA with respect to identifying resting-state networks. RESULTS: LLE consistently found task-related components as well as known resting-state networks, and the algorithm compared well to PCA. The non-linear example data set demonstrated that LLE, unlike PCA, can separate non-linearly modulated sources in a low-dimensional subspace. Given the same target dimensionality, LLE also performed better than non-linear PCA. CONCLUSION: LLE is promising for fMRI data analysis and has potential advantages compared with PCA in terms of its ability to find non-linear relationships.",

We conducted a resting-state fMRI in 19 healthy controls, 18 cirrhotic patients without HE, and 22 cirrhotic patients with low-grade HE. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of fMRI signal was computed to measure the spontaneous neuronal activity. Several regions showing significant ALFF differences among three groups were the precuneus, occipital lobe, left frontal lobe and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, and left cerebellum posterior lobe. Compared to controls or patients without HE, patients with low-grade HE showed decreased ALFF in the precuneus and adjacent cuneus, visual cortex, and left cerebellum posterior lobe. Compared to controls, patients with low-grade HE showed higher ALFF in both cortical and subcortical regions, including the right middle cingulate gyrus, and left anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and lentiform nucleus; compared to patients without HE, patients with low-grade HE showed higher ALFF in the left medial frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral superior frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. Moreover, correlations between ALFF changes and poor neurocognitive performances were found in patients with low-grade HE. These results suggested the existence of aberrant brain activity at the baseline state in low-grade HE, which may be implicated in the neurological pathophysiology underlying HE",

However, the presence and extent of whole-brain connectivity disturbances is largely unknown in aMCI patients. Twenty-six aMCI patients and eighteen matched healthy subjects were evaluated at baseline and at mean 20 months follow up. Temporal correlations between spatially distinct regions were evaluated by using longitudinal resting-state fMRI. Compared to normal aging controls, patterns of abnormal interregional correlations in widely dispersed brain areas were identified in the patients, which also changed with disease progression. These disturbances were found particularly in subcortical regions and frontal cortex. Importantly, significantly decreased negative functional connection may be specifically associated with the development of aMCI patients. This suggests a compensatory mechanism is underway where local processing deficits are offset by recruitment of more dispersed cortical regions. In addition, the presence of this increased connectivity is seen to eventually weaken with disease progression. The results suggest that patterns of whole-brain functional connection may be a useful risk marker for conversion to AD in aMCI patients.",

Brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding the correlation matrices among the parcellated regions and further analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Both atlas-based brain functional networks were found to show robust small-world properties and truncated power-law connectivity degree distributions, which are consistent with previous brain functional and structural networks studies. However, more importantly, we found that there were significant differences in multiple topological parameters (e.g., small-worldness and degree distribution) between the two groups of brain functional networks derived from the two atlases. This study provides quantitative evidence on how the topological organization of brain networks is affected by the different parcellation strategies applied",

    abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) is often considered a functionally homogeneous system that is broadly associated with internally directed cognition (e.g., episodic memory, theory of mind, self-evaluation). However, few studies have examined how this network interacts with other networks during putative "default" processes such as episodic memory retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the topography and response profile of human parietal regions inside and outside the DMN, independently defined using task-evoked deactivations and resting-state functional connectivity, during episodic memory retrieval. Memory retrieval activated posterior nodes of the DMN, particularly the angular gyrus, but also more anterior and dorsal parietal regions that were anatomically separate from the DMN. The two sets of parietal regions showed different resting-state functional connectivity and response profiles. During memory retrieval, responses in DMN regions peaked sooner than non-DMN regions, which in turn showed responses that were sustained until a final memory judgment was reached. Moreover, a parahippocampal region that showed strong resting-state connectivity with parietal DMN regions also exhibited a pattern of task-evoked activity similar to that exhibited by DMN regions. These results suggest that DMN parietal regions directly supported memory retrieval, whereas non-DMN parietal regions were more involved in postretrieval processes such as memory-based decision making. Finally, a robust functional dissociation within the DMN was observed. Whereas angular gyrus and posterior cingulate/precuneus were significantly activated during memory retrieval, an anterior DMN node in medial prefrontal cortex was strongly deactivated. This latter finding demonstrates functional heterogeneity rather than homogeneity within the DMN during episodic memory retrieval.},

In this study we perform continuous resting-state functional connectivity MRI in 5- to 8-year-old children in an awake state to identify and characterize resting-state networks (RSNs). Temporal concatenation independent component analysis (ICA) approach was applied to analyze the data. We identified 14 components consisting of regions known to be involved in visual and auditory processing, motor function, attention control, memory, and the default mode network (DMN). Most networks, in particular those supporting basic motor function and sensory related processing, had a robust functional organization similar to mature adult patterns. In contrast, the DMN and other RSNs involved in higher-order cognitive functions had immature characteristics, revealing incomplete and fragmented patterns indicating less developed functional connectivity. We therefore conclude that the DMN and other RSNs involved in higher order cognitive functioning are detectable, yet in an immature state, at an age when these cognitive abilities are mastered.

Acceptable reproducibility of spatial maps of BOLD signal changes was found across sessions, with the highest correlation values ranging from 0.18 to 0.44. The dominant frequency of signal changes from independent components with the highest correlation values was approximately the frequency range of the respiratory circle. Activities of spinal motor neurons innervating the scalenes were considered as a major factor in the production of BOLD signal fluctuations were observed in this study.

While AE is selectively disrupted in psychopathy, autism is associated with deficits in CE. Despite such dissociations, AE and CE together contribute to normal human empathic experience. A dimensional measure of individual differences in AE 'relative to' CE captures this interaction and may reveal brain-behavior relationships beyond those detectable with AE and CE separately. Using resting-state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain's intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with stronger functional connectivity among social-emotional regions (ventral anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior cingulate). Dominance of CE was related to stronger connectivity among areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and social-cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus, ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength of several functional connections were associated with symptoms of psychopathology. These findings suggest that REA provides a dimensional index of empathic function and pathological tendencies in healthy adults, which are reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with social and emotional cognition.",

We measure the functional coherence of a fiber as the time series' correlation of two gray matter voxels that this fiber connects. The functional connectivity strength between two brain regions is defined as the average functional coherence of fibers connecting them. Our results demonstrate that: 1) The functional coherence of fibers is correlated with the brain regions they connect; 2) The functional connectivity between brain regions is correlated with structural connectivity. And these two patterns are consistent across subjects. These results may provide new insights into the brain's structural and functional architecture.",

We analyzed resting-state fMRI data using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and a resting-state fMRI data analysis toolkit (REST).

Children with PMNE exhibited significant differences in ALFF or ReHo in the left inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus (Brodmann area, BA 10), and left midbrain. Abnormalities in BA 10 and the inferior frontal gyrus may affect children's decision-making with regard to voiding; abnormalities in the midbrain in PMNE children may influence the internal signal transmission in their bladder control network.

Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component. However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment awareness",

We calculated correlations reflecting functional connectivity between a priori defined regions-of-interest and the bilateral TPJ seed regions, comprising the neural network involved in inner speech processes and AVH.RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, schizophrenia patients showed reduced functional connectivity between left TPJ and the right homotope of Broca. Within the patient group, more severe AVH were associated with reduced neural coupling between left TPJ and bilateral anterior cingulate as well as the bilateral amygdala.CONCLUSIONS: In schizophrenia patients with chronic hallucinations, the left TPJ-a critical node in the speech perception/AVH network-shows reduced functional connectivity with brain areas involved in the attribution of agency, self-referent processing, and attentional control.",

The most important finding was that RSPM scores were positively correlated with both GMV and ReHo values in brain areas that belong to the salience network, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the fronto-insular cortex. Additionally, we found positive or negative correlations between RSPM scores and GMV or ReHo values in brain areas of the central-executive, default-mode, sensorimotor and visual networks.

Topological modularity of brain functional networks can quantify theoretically anticipated abnormality of brain network community structure - so-called dysmodularity - in developmental disorders such as childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). We used graph theory to investigate topology of networks derived from resting-state fMRI data on 13 COS patients and 19 healthy volunteers. We measured functional connectivity between each pair of 100 regional nodes, focusing on wavelet correlation in the frequency interval 0.05-0.1 Hz, then applied global and local thresholding rules to construct graphs from each individual association matrix over the full range of possible connection densities. We show how local thresholding based on the minimum spanning tree facilitates group comparisons of networks by forcing the connectedness of sparse graphs. Threshold-dependent graph theoretical results are compatible with the results of a k-means unsupervised learning algorithm and a multi-resolution (spin glass) approach to modularity, both of which also find community structure but do not require thresholding of the association matrix. In general modularity of brain functional networks was significantly reduced in COS, due to a relatively reduced density of intra-modular connections between neighboring regions. Other network measures of local organization such as clustering were also decreased, while complementary measures of global efficiency and robustness were increased, in the COS group. The group differences in complex network properties were mirrored by differences in simpler statistical properties of the data, such as the variability of the global time series and the internal homogeneity of the time series within anatomical regions of interest.",

In the most recent fMRI effective connectivity measures, pair-wise GCM has commonly been applied based on single-voxel values or average values from special brain areas at the group level. Although a few novel conditional GCM methods have been proposed to quantify the connections between brain areas, our study is the first to propose a viable standardized approach for group analysis of fMRI data with GCM. To compare the effectiveness of our approach with traditional pair-wise GCM models, we applied a well-established conditional GCM to preselected time series of brain regions resulting from general linear model (GLM) and group spatial kernel independent component analysis of an fMRI data set in the temporal domain. Data sets consisting of one task-related and one resting-state fMRI were used to investigate connections among brain areas with the conditional GCM method. With the GLM-detected brain activation regions in the emotion-related cortex during the block design paradigm, the conditional GCM method was proposed to study the causality of the habituation between the left amygdala and pregenual cingulate cortex during emotion processing. For the resting-state data set, it is possible to calculate not only the effective connectivity between networks but also the heterogeneity within a single network. Our results have further shown a particular interacting pattern of default mode network that can be characterized as both afferent and efferent influences on the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest that the conditional GCM approach based on a linear multivariate vector autoregressive model can achieve greater accuracy in detecting network connectivity than the widely used pair-wise GCM, and this group analysis methodology can be quite useful to extend the information obtainable in fMRI.",

Here, we explore the potential contribution of intrinsic or spontaneous brain activity to conceptual processing by examining whether resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals can account for individual differences in the conceptual processing efficiencies of healthy individuals. We acquired rs-fMRI and behavioral data on object conceptual processing tasks. We found that the regional amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the left (posterior) middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) was highly correlated with participants' semantic processing efficiency. Furthermore, the strength of the functional connectivity between the LMTG and a series of brain regions-the left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior temporal lobe, bilateral medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate gyrus, and ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices-also significantly predicted conceptual behavior. The regional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and functionally relevant connectivity strengths of LMTG together accounted for 74\% of individual variance in object conceptual performance. This semantic network, with the LMTG as its core component, largely overlaps with the regions reported in previous conceptual/semantic task-based fMRI studies.

We tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity differences exist between older adults with and without MCI using resting-state fMRI. Data were collected on over 200 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based, clinical-pathological cohort study of aging. From the cohort, 40 participants were identified as having MCI, and were compared to 40 demographically matched participants without cognitive impairment. MCI participants showed lesser functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right and left orbital frontal, right middle frontal, left putamen, right caudate, left superior temporal, and right posterior cingulate regions; and greater connectivity with right inferior frontal, left fusiform, left rectal, and left precentral regions. Furthermore, in an alternate sample of 113, connectivity values in regions of difference correlated with episodic memory and processing speed. Results suggest functional connectivity values in regions of difference are associated with cognitive function and may reflect the presence of AD pathology and increased risk of developing clinical AD.

The multiplexed-EPI (M-EPI) pulse sequence combines two forms of multiplexing: temporal multiplexing (m) utilizing simultaneous echo refocused (SIR) EPI and spatial multiplexing (n) with multibanded RF pulses (MB) to achieve m×n images in an EPI echo train instead of the normal single image. This resulted in an unprecedented reduction in EPI scan time for whole brain fMRI performed at 3 Tesla, permitting TRs of 400 ms and 800 ms compared to a more conventional 2.5 sec TR, and 2-4 times reductions in scan time for HARDI imaging of neuronal fibertracks. The simultaneous SE refocusing of SIR imaging at 7 Tesla advantageously reduced SAR by using fewer RF refocusing pulses and by shifting fat signal out of the image plane so that fat suppression pulses were not required. In preliminary studies of resting state functional networks identified through independent component analysis, the 6-fold higher sampling rate increased the peak functional sensitivity by 60\%. The novel M-EPI pulse sequence resulted in a significantly increased temporal resolution for whole brain fMRI, and as such, this new methodology can be used for studying non-stationarity in networks and generally for expanding and enriching the functional information.",

    abstract = "To investigate fluctuations in the amplitude of low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during acute brain ischemia, and to evaluate the use of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) in resting state fMRI for assessing super-acute focal cerebral ischemic stroke. A super-acute stroke model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat was employed. Spontaneous fluctuations were recorded using a series of gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) images before and 30min, 60min, 2h, 6h, 12h, and 24h after MCAO. After preprocessing, serial fMRI data were obtained by fast Fourier transformation to calculate the ALFFs. Statistical parametric mapping software was used for the statistical analysis of ALFFs. T2-weighted images and diffusion weighted images (DWI) were also performed to detect the ischemic lesion. The signal intensities of abnormal ALFFs increased and migrated from the core of the ischemic lesion areas to the edge of lesion following MCAO. The dynamic changes in the ALFF maps demonstrated that the sizes of the ALFF regions exceeded beyond the borderline of the DWI lesions during the super-acute ischemic stroke stage. There was a significant difference in the ALFFs maps between the ischemic stroke group and the control group (P<0.005; cluster size>10 voxels), which mainly occurred in the periphery of the ischemic region in the cortex. These data suggest that ALFF maps provide hemodynamic BOLD information on neural activity, and have potential for predicting survival and prognosis of acute ischemic brain tissues",

    abstract = "Imaging studies in blind subjects have consistently shown that sensory and cognitive tasks evoke activity in the occipital cortex, which is normally visual. The precise areas involved and degree of activation are dependent upon the cause and age of onset of blindness. Here, we investigated the cortical language network at rest and during an auditory covert naming task in five bilaterally anophthalmic subjects, who have never received visual input. When listening to auditory definitions and covertly retrieving words, these subjects activated lateral occipital cortex bilaterally in addition to the language areas activated in sighted controls. This activity was significantly greater than that present in a control condition of listening to reversed speech. The lateral occipital cortex was also recruited into a left-lateralized resting-state network that usually comprises anterior and posterior language areas. Levels of activation to the auditory naming and reversed speech conditions did not differ in the calcarine (striate) cortex. This primary 'visual' cortex was not recruited to the left-lateralized resting-state network and showed high interhemispheric correlation of activity at rest, as is typically seen in unimodal cortical areas. In contrast, the interhemispheric correlation of resting activity in extrastriate areas was reduced in anophthalmia to the level of cortical areas that are heteromodal, such as the inferior frontal gyrus. Previous imaging studies in the congenitally blind show that primary visual cortex is activated in higher-order tasks, such as language and memory to a greater extent than during more basic sensory processing, resulting in a reversal of the normal hierarchy of functional organization across 'visual' areas. Our data do not support such a pattern of organization in anophthalmia. Instead, the patterns of activity during task and the functional connectivity at rest are consistent with the known hierarchy of processing in these areas normally seen for vision. The differences in cortical organization between bilateral anophthalmia and other forms of congenital blindness are considered to be due to the total absence of stimulation in 'visual' cortex by light or retinal activity in the former condition, and suggests development of subcortical auditory input to the geniculo-striate pathway",

Such a model would ease the administration of sedative agents, reduce the number of animals required in survival experiments and eliminate animal-to-animal variability seen in previous designs. Seven male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent surgical placement of an MRI-compatible vascular access port, followed by implantable electrode placement on the right median nerve. Functional MRI during nerve stimulation and resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) were performed at times 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively using a 9.4T scanner. Anesthesia was maintained using intravenous dexmedetomidine and reversed using atipamezole. There were no fatalities or infectious complications during this study. All vascular access ports remained patent. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation by electrical stimulation of the median nerve using implanted electrodes was seen within the forelimb sensory region (S1FL) for all animals at all time points. The number of activated voxels decreased at time points 4 and 8 weeks, returning to a normal level at 12 weeks, which is attributed to scar tissue formation and resolution around the embedded electrode. The applications of this experiment extend far beyond the scope of peripheral nerve experimentation. These vascular access ports can be applied to any survival MRI study requiring repeated medication administration, intravenous contrast, or blood sampling.",

In this study, we have investigated the amplitude and spatiotemporal characteristics of resting-state activity patterns and their dependence on the subjects' alertness. For this purpose, BOLD fMRI was performed at 3.0 T on 12 normal subjects using a visual stimulation protocol, followed by a 27 min rest period, during which subjects were allowed to fall asleep. In subjects who were asleep at the end of the scan, we found (a) a higher amplitude of BOLD signal fluctuation during rest compared with subjects who were awake at the end of the scan; (b) spatially independent patterns of correlated activity that involve all of gray matter, including deep brain nuclei; (c) many patterns that were consistent across subjects; (d) that average percentage levels of fluctuation in visual cortex (VC) and whole brain were higher in subjects who were asleep (up to 1.71\% and 1.16\%, respectively) than in those who were awake (up to 1.15\% and 0.96\%) at the end of the scan and were comparable with those levels evoked by intense visual stimulation (up to 1.85\% and 0.76\% for two subject groups); (e) no confirmation of correlation, positive or negative, between thalamus and VC found in earlier studies. These findings suggest that resting-state activity continues during sleep and does not require active cognitive processes or conscious awareness.",

    abstract = "Brain activity during resting wakefulness is characterized by slow (<0.1Hz) fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals that are topographically organized in discrete functional connectivity networks (resting-state networks, RSNs). The present study aimed at revealing possible network-specific alcohol-induced changes in resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) signals. RS-fMRI was carried out on eight healthy subjects in four consecutive 6-min sessions, one before and three after a 0.7 g/kg dose of ethyl alcohol. Control experiments were carried out in different days without alcohol administration. Independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on all experimental and control scans to extract individual and group-level RSN maps in a dynamic network analysis. Alcohol administration significantly increased the overall strength of the visual network ICA component, reaching the peak at 90 min. Within the visual network, the alcohol-induced increase was more pronounced in the primary regions of the occipital cortex and less pronounced in the secondary regions of the occipito-temporal cortex. Other major RSN components, such as the default-mode, the fronto-parietal, the sensori-motor, the self-referential and the auditory components, did not exhibit alcohol-induced changes during the same time window. Alcohol-induced effects on the resting-state functional connectivity of the visual network observed in the present study demonstrate that the visual system is a selective and primary target of acute alcohol administration. The strong enhancement of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the primary visual cortex in an acute alcoholic state may impair the normal activation response to visual stimuli and affect visual perception.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the joint effect of genetic polymorphisms coding for DA catabolism and glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) on brain functioning. The study group (90 right-handed white Caucasian healthy individuals) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments to examine blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response during a WM task with varying cognitive load (1-, 2- and 3-back). We have also examined skin conductance response (SCR) during the WM task and resting-state cerebral blood flow with continuous arterial spin labelling. The genetic markers of interest included Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) (Met(158)Val) and NR3C1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (BclI C/G rs41423247, 9$\beta$ A/G rs6198 and rs1866388 A/G). Haplotype-based analyses showed (i) a significant effect of COMT polymorphism on left anterior cingulate cortex, with greater deactivation in Met carriers than in Val/Val homozygotes; (ii) a significant effect of BclI polymorphism on right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with greater activation in G/G carriers than in C carriers and (iii) an interactive effect of BclI (G/G) and COMT (Met/Met) polymorphisms, which was associated with greater activation in right DLPFC. These effects remained significant after controlling for whole-brain resting-state blood flow. SCR amplitude was positively correlated with right DLPFC activation during WM. This study demonstrated that GR and COMT markers exert their separate, as well as interactive, effects on DLPFC function. Epistasis of COMT and BclI minor alleles is associated with higher activation, suggesting lower efficiency, of DLPFC during WM.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 15 November 2011; doi:10.1038/mp.2011.145.",

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a frequent finding on CT and MRI scans of elderly people and is related to vascular risk factors and cognitive and motor impairment, ultimately leading to dementia or parkinsonism in some. In general, the relations are weak, and not all subjects with SVD become demented or get parkinsonism. This might be explained by the diversity of underlying pathology of both white matter lesions (WML) and the normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Both cannot be properly appreciated with conventional MRI. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides alternative information on microstructural white matter integrity. The association between SVD, its microstructural integrity, and incident dementia and parkinsonism has never been investigated. METHODS/DESIGN: The RUN DMC study is a prospective cohort study on the risk factors and cognitive and motor consequences of brain changes among 503 non-demented elderly, aged between 50-85 years, with cerebral SVD. First follow up is being prepared for July 2011. Participants alive will be included and invited to the research centre to undergo a structured questionnaire on demographics and vascular risk factors, and a cognitive, and motor, assessment, followed by a MRI protocol including conventional MRI, DTI and resting state fMRI. DISCUSSION: The follow up of the RUN DMC study has the potential to further unravel the causes and possibly better predict the consequences of changes in white matter integrity in elderly with SVD by using relatively new imaging techniques. When proven, these changes might function as a surrogate endpoint for cognitive and motor function in future therapeutic trials. Our data could furthermore provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive and motor disturbances in elderly with SVD. The execution and completion of the follow up of our study might ultimately unravel the role of SVD on the microstructural integrity of the white matter in the transition from "normal" aging to cognitive and motor decline and impairment and eventually to incident dementia and parkinsonism.},

Although microstructural processes of neuronal maturation remain accessible only to morphometric post-mortem studies, neuroimaging tools permit the examination of macrostructural aspects of brain development. The analysis of resting-state functional connectivity (FC) offers novel possibilities for the investigation of cerebral development. Using seed-based FC methods, we examined the development of 5 functionally distinct cingulate-based intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in children (n = 14, 10.6 +/- 1.5 years), adolescents (n = 12, 15.4 +/- 1.2) and young adults (n=14, 22.4 +/- 1.2). Children demonstrated a more diffuse pattern of correlation with voxels proximal to the seed region of interest (ROI) ("local FC"), whereas adults exhibited more focal patterns of FC, as well as a greater number of significantly correlated voxels at long distances from the seed ROI. Adolescents exhibited intermediate patterns of FC. Consistent with evidence for different maturational time courses, ICNs associated with social and emotional functions exhibited the greatest developmental effects. Our findings demonstrate the utility of FC for the study of developing functional organization. Moreover, given that ICNs are thought to have an anatomical basis in neuronal connectivity, measures of FC may provide a quantitative index of brain maturation in healthy subjects and those with neurodevelopmental disorders},

In this review, we examine the behavioral, physiological and neurological evidences relevant to this coherent brain activity and, in particular, to each network. The investigation of functional connectivity appears promising from a clinical perspective, considering the amount of evidence regarding the importance of spontaneous activity and that resting-state paradigms are inherently simple to implement.

The advantages for fMRI brought about by the increasingly popular ultra-high field strengths are best exploited in high-resolution acquisitions, but here 2D EPI becomes impractical for several reasons, including the very long volume acquisitions times. In this study at 7 T, a 3D EPI sequence with full parallel and partial Fourier imaging capability along both phase encoding axes was implemented and used to evaluate the sensitivity of 3D and corresponding 2D EPI acquisitions at four different spatial resolutions ranging from small to typical voxel sizes (1.5-3.0 mm isotropic). Whole-brain resting state measurements (N=4) revealed a better, or at least comparable sensitivity of the 3D method for gray and white matter. The larger vulnerability of 3D to physiological effects was outweighed by the much shorter volume TR, which moreover allows whole-brain coverage at high resolution within fully acceptable limits for event-related fMRI: TR was only 3.07 s for 1.5 mm, 1.88 s for 2.0 mm, 1.38 s for 2.5 mm and 1.07 s for 3.0 mm isotropic resolution. In order to investigate the ability to detect and spatially resolve BOLD activation in the visual cortex, functional 3D EPI experiments (N=8) were performed at 1 mm isotropic resolution with parallel imaging acceleration of 3x3, resulting in a TR of only 3.2 s for whole-brain coverage. From our results, and several other practical advantages of 3D over 2D EPI found in the present study, we conclude that 3D EPI provides a useful alternative for whole-brain fMRI at 7 T, not only when high-resolution data are required.",

    abstract = {Resting fluctuations in arterial CO(2) (a cerebral vasodilator) are believed to be an important source of low-frequency blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. In this study we focus on the two commonly used resting-states in functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, eyes open and eyes closed, and quantify the degree to which measured spontaneous fluctuations in the partial pressure of end-tidal CO(2) (Pet(co2)) relate to BOLD signal time series. A significantly longer latency of BOLD signal changes following Pet(co2) fluctuations was found in the eyes closed condition compared to with eyes open, which may reveal different intrinsic vascular response delays in CO(2) reactivity or an alteration in the net BOLD signal arising from Pet(co2) fluctuations and altered neural activity with eyes closed. By allowing a spatially varying time delay for the compensation of this temporal difference, a more spatially consistent CO(2) correlation map can be obtained. Finally, Granger-causality analysis demonstrated a "causal" relationship between Pet(co2) and BOLD. The identified dominant Pet(co2)→BOLD directional coupling supports the notion that Pet(co2) fluctuations are indeed a cause of resting BOLD variance in the majority of subjects},

Previous studies found that the superior temporal cortex in deaf people is reorganized to process non-auditory stimuli, as revealed by the extrinsic task-induced brain activities. However, it is unknown how the intrinsic activities of this region are impacted by deafness. This study explored this issue using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined 60 congenitally deaf (CD) individuals, 39 acquired deaf (AD) individuals, and 38 hearing controls (HC), and focused on the effect of deafness on the intra- and inter-regional synchronization of different parts of superior temporal sulcus (STS). We found that intra-regional synchronization or regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the middle STS (mSTS) was decreased in AD compared with HC or CD, while the CD had preserved ReHo in mSTS. Greater connectivity was observed between mSTS and posterior STS in CD and HC than in AD, while both CD and AD had weaker connectivity of mSTS with the anterior STS (aSTS) compared with HC. Moreover, the connectivity of mSTS-aSTS in CD and AD was associated with their language skills. These findings confirmed our hypothesis that the intrinsic function of different parts of STS is distinctly impacted by deafness",

To date, it has been used to extract sets of mutually correlated brain regions without prior information on the time course of these regions. Some of these sets of regions, interpreted as functional networks, have recently been used to provide markers of brain diseases and open the road to paradigm-free population comparisons. Such group studies raise the question of modeling subject variability within ICA: how can the patterns representative of a group be modeled and estimated via ICA for reliable inter-group comparisons? In this paper, we propose a hierarchical model for patterns in multi-subject fMRI datasets, akin to mixed-effect group models used in linear-model-based analysis. We introduce an estimation procedure, CanICA (Canonical ICA), based on i) probabilistic dimension reduction of the individual data, ii) canonical correlation analysis to identify a data subspace common to the group iii) ICA-based pattern extraction. In addition, we introduce a procedure based on cross-validation to quantify the stability of ICA patterns at the level of the group. We compare our method with state-of-the-art multi-subject fMRI ICA methods and show that the features extracted using our procedure are more reproducible at the group level on two datasets of 12 healthy controls: a resting-state and a functional localizer study.",

By combining neuroscience knowledge and computational intelligence capabilities, visual analytics can generate accurate, reliable and individualized ROIs for brain networks via joint modeling of multimodal neuroimaging data and an intuitive and real-time visual analytics interface. Furthermore, it can be used as a functional ROI optimization and prediction solution when fMRI data is unavailable or inadequate. We have applied this approach to an operation span working memory fMRI/DTI dataset, a schizophrenia DTI/resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) dataset, and a mild cognitive impairment DTI/R-fMRI dataset, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of visual analytics.

The armamentarium of neuroimaging is becoming increasingly versatile, and now includes methods with considerable spatial, temporal and/or molecular resolution.

The current study presents a comprehensive assessment of macaque resting-state networks based on evaluation of intrinsic low-frequency fluctuations of the blood oxygen-level-dependent signal using group independent component analysis. Networks were found underlying multiple levels of sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. The results demonstrate that macaques share remarkable homologous network organization with humans, thereby providing strong support for their use as an animal model in the study of normal and abnormal brain connectivity as well as aiding the interpretation of electrophysiological recordings within the context of large-scale brain networks.",

Although distinct resting-state networks related to vision, language, executive processing, and other sensory and cognitive domains have been identified, considerable skepticism remains as to whether resting-state functional connectivity maps reflect neural connectivity or simply track BOLD signal correlations driven by nonneural artifact. Here we combine diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography with resting-state fcMRI to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity. These 2 modalities were used to investigate connectivity within the default mode network, a set of brain regions--including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTLs), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/retropslenial cortex (RSC)--implicated in episodic memory processing. Using seed regions from the functional connectivity maps, the DTI analysis revealed robust structural connections between the MTLs and the retrosplenial cortex whereas tracts from the MPFC contacted the PCC (just rostral to the RSC). The results demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity and that combining modalities can enrich our understanding of these canonical brain networks.",

Pearson correlations (r-values) were computed between resting state spontaneous activity in selected seed regions (sROI) and each voxel throughout the brain.

The group with diplegia showed significantly expanded networks for the somatomotor but not dorsal attention areas. These expanded networks overran nearly all topological representations in somatosensory and motor areas despite a sROI in a fingertip focus. A possible underlying cause for altered fcMRI in the group with dipegia, and generally sensorimotor deficits in spastic diplegia, is that prenatal third trimester white-matter injury leads to localized damage to subplate neurons. We hypothesize that intracortical connections become dominant in spastic diplegia through successful competition with diminished or absent thalamocortical inputs. Similar to the effects of subplate ablations on ocular dominance columns (Kanold and Shatz, Neuron 2006;51:627-638), a spike timing-dependent plasticity model is proposed to explain a shift towards intracortical inputs.",

Using functional MRI we measured brain activity in young adults during tasks and rest, and utilized a multivariate method to assess task-related changes as well as functional connectivity. An overlapping set of regions showed increased activity for judgments about the self, and about a close other, and strong functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate, a critical node of the DN. These areas included ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and medial temporal regions, all thought to be part of the DN. Several additional regions, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral caudate, also showed the same pattern of activity and connectivity.

Additionally, altered connectivity of these regions during resting state was found. However, the relationship between brain activity during tasks and resting state remains poorly understood. The present study investigated neural correlates associated with abnormal response inhibition in OCD and to examine how resting state functional connectivity relates to task-related activity. METHOD: Eighteen unmedicated adult OCD patients and 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during both resting state and a response inhibition task. Brain activation during response inhibition was compared between groups. Fronto-striatal regions showing altered task-related activity were used as seeds for connectivity analyses during resting state. RESULTS: During the response inhibition task, OCD patients had lower activation in areas including the cingulate cortex and basal ganglia regions. Compared with control subjects, patients with OCD showed increased functional connectivity of the caudate nucleus with the middle cingulate cortex and precentral gyrus during rest, suggesting hyperactive striatal-cortical connections. CONCLUSION: This study found altered function in fronto-striatal regions during response inhibition and its relation to resting state functional connectivity in OCD. Our results suggest that dysfunctional striatal-cortical connections even during rest may result in the failure of response inhibition and error monitoring observed in OCD patients",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal acquisition duration on stability of computed graph theory metrics of brain network connectivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institutional ethics committee approved this study, and informed consent was obtained. BOLD signal (7.5 minutes worth) was obtained from 30 subjects and truncated into 30-second time bins that ranged from 1.5 to 7.5 minutes. A binarized adjacency matrix for each subject and acquisition duration was generated at network costs between 0.1 and 0.5, where network cost is defined as the ratio of the number of edges (connections) in a network to the maximum possible number of edges. Measures of correlation coefficient stability associated with functional connectivity matrices (correlation coefficient standard deviation [SD] and correlation threshold) and associated graph theory metrics (small worldness, local efficiency, and global efficiency) were computed for each subject at each BOLD signal acquisition duration. Computations were implemented with a 15-node 30-core computer cluster to enable analysis of the approximately 2000 resulting brain networks. Analysis of variance and posthoc analyses were conducted to identify differences between time bins for each measure. RESULTS: Small worldness, local efficiency, and global efficiency stabilized after 2 minutes of BOLD signal acquisition, whereas correlation coefficient data from functional connectivity matrices (correlation coefficient SD and cost-associated threshold) stabilized after 5 minutes of BOLD signal acquisition. CONCLUSION: Graph theory metrics of brain network connectivity (small worldness, local efficiency, and global efficiency) may be accurately computed from as little as 1.5-2.0 minutes of RS functional MR imaging BOLD signal. As such, implementation of these methods in the context of time-constrained clinical imaging protocols may be feasible and cost-effective.

    abstract = "Individuals with schizophrenia show a broad range of language impairments, similar to those observed in reading disability (RD). Genetic linkage and association studies of RD have identified a number of candidate RD-genes that are associated with neuronal migration. Some individuals with schizophrenia also show evidence of impaired cortical neuronal migration. We have previously linked RD-related genes with gray matter distributions in healthy controls and schizophrenia. The aim of the current study was to extend these structural findings and to examine links between putative RD-genes and functional connectivity of language-related regions in healthy controls (n = 27) and schizophrenia (n = 28). Parallel independent component analysis (parallel-ICA) was used to examine the relationship between language-related regions extracted from resting-state fMRI and 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 5 RD-related genes. Parallel-ICA identified four significant fMRI-SNP relationships. A Left Broca-Superior/Inferior Parietal network was related to two KIAA0319 SNPs in controls but not in schizophrenia. For both diagnostic groups, a Broca-Medial Parietal network was related to two DCDC2 SNPs, while a Left Wernicke-Fronto-Occipital network was related to two KIAA0319 SNPs. A Bilateral Wernicke-Fronto-Parietal network was related to one KIAA0319 SNP only in controls. Thus, RD-genes influence functional connectivity in language-related regions, but no RD-gene uniquely affected network function in schizophrenia as compared to controls. This is in contrast with our previous study where RD-genes affected gray matter distribution in some structural networks in schizophrenia but not in controls. Thus these RD-genes may exert a more important influence on structure rather than function of language-related networks in schizophrenia",

    abstract = {Brain regions which exhibit temporally coherent fluctuations, have been increasingly studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Such networks are often identified in the context of an fMRI scan collected during rest (and thus are called "resting state networks"); however, they are also present during (and modulated by) the performance of a cognitive task. In this article, we will refer to such networks as temporally coherent networks (TCNs). Although there is still some debate over the physiological source of these fluctuations, TCNs are being studied in a variety of ways. Recent studies have examined ways TCNs can be used to identify patterns associated with various brain disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, autism or Alzheimer's disease). Independent component analysis (ICA) is one method being used to identify TCNs. ICA is a data driven approach which is especially useful for decomposing activation during complex cognitive tasks where multiple operations occur simultaneously. In this article we review recent TCN studies with emphasis on those that use ICA. We also present new results showing that TCNs are robust, and can be consistently identified at rest and during performance of a cognitive task in healthy individuals and in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, multiple TCNs show temporal and spatial modulation during the cognitive task versus rest. In summary, TCNs show considerable promise as potential imaging biological markers of brain diseases, though each network needs to be studied in more detail.},

New adaptations in study design and technologic advances, especially the study of resting state functional connectivity as well as the use of passive task design in sedated children, have increased the utility of functional imaging in pediatrics to help us gain understanding into the developing brain at work.

    title = "{The UCLA multimodal connectivity database: a web-based platform for brain connectivity matrix sharing and analysis.}",
    abstract = {Brain connectomics research has rapidly expanded using functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (dwMRI). A common product of these varied analyses is a connectivity matrix (CM). A CM stores the connection strength between any two regions ("nodes") in a brain network. This format is useful for several reasons: (1) it is highly distilled, with minimal data size and complexity, (2) graph theory can be applied to characterize the network's topology, and (3) it retains sufficient information to capture individual differences such as age, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ), or disease state. Here we introduce the UCLA Multimodal Connectivity Database (http://umcd.humanconnectomeproject.org), an openly available website for brain network analysis and data sharing. The site is a repository for researchers to publicly share CMs derived from their data. The site also allows users to select any CM shared by another user, compute graph theoretical metrics on the site, visualize a report of results, or download the raw CM. To date, users have contributed over 2000 individual CMs, spanning different imaging modalities (fMRI, dwMRI) and disorders (Alzheimer's, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder). To demonstrate the site's functionality, whole brain functional and structural connectivity matrices are derived from 60 subjects' (ages 26-45) resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and dwMRI data and uploaded to the site. The site is utilized to derive graph theory global and regional measures for the rs-fMRI and dwMRI networks. Global and nodal graph theoretical measures between functional and structural networks exhibit low correspondence. This example demonstrates how this tool can enhance the comparability of brain networks from different imaging modalities and studies. The existence of this connectivity-based repository should foster broader data sharing and enable larger-scale meta-analyses comparing networks across imaging modality, age group, and disease state},

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The authors used resting-state functional connectivity MRI to evaluate brain networks in patients with refractory and nonrefractory major depressive disorder. METHOD: In a cross-sectional study, 28 patients with refractory major depression, 32 patients with nonrefractory major depression, and 48 healthy comparison subjects underwent scanning using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence on a 3-T MR system. Thirteen regions of interest that have been identified in the literature as relevant to mood regulation were selected as seed areas. A reference time series was extracted for each seed and used for voxel-wise correlation analysis with the rest of the brain. Voxel-based comparisons of z-value maps among the three groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc t tests with age and duration of illness as covariates of no interest. RESULTS: Relative to healthy comparison subjects, both patient groups showed significantly reduced connectivity in prefrontal-limbic-thalamic areas bilaterally. However, the nonrefractory group showed a more distributed decrease in connectivity than the refractory group, especially in the anterior cingulate cortex and in the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula bilaterally; in contrast, the refractory group showed disrupted functional connectivity mainly in prefrontal areas and in thalamus areas bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: Refractory depression is associated with disrupted functional connectivity mainly in thalamo-cortical circuits, while nonrefractory depression is associated with more distributed decreased connectivity in the limbic-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit. These results suggest that nonrefractory and refractory depression are characterized by distinct functional deficits in distributed brain networks.",

The influence of the number of independent components (maps) on the results of ICA was investigated. The influence of the selection of the seeds on the results of CCA was also examined. Our results reveal that significant differences between these two approaches exist. The performance of ICA is superior as compared with that of CCA; in addition, the performance of ICA is not significantly affected by structured noise over a relatively large range. The results of ICA could be affected by the number of independent components if this number is too small, however. Converting the spatially independent maps of ICA into z maps for thresholding tends to overestimate the false-positive rate. However, the overestimation is not very severe and may be acceptable in most cases. The results of CCA are dependent on seeds location.

Here, we modeled default network as undirected weighted graph and then used graph theory to investigate the topological properties of the default network of the two groups of people with different intelligence levels. We found that, in both groups, the posterior cingulate cortex showed the greatest degree in comparison to the other brain regions in the default network, and that the medial temporal lobes and cerebellar tonsils were topologically separations from the other brain regions in the default network. More importantly, we found that the strength of some functional connectivities and the global efficiency of default network were significantly different between the superior intelligence group and the average intelligence group, which indicates that the functional integration of the default network might be related to the individual intelligent performance.",

    abstract = "IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: With the emergence of therapeutic candidates for the incurable and rapidly progressive neurodegenerative condition of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), it will be essential to develop easily obtainable biomarkers for diagnosis, as well as monitoring, in a disease where clinical examination remains the predominant diagnostic tool. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has greatly developed over the past thirty years since its initial introduction to neuroscience. With multi-modal applications, MRI is now offering exciting opportunities to develop practical biomarkers in ALS. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The historical application of MRI to the field of ALS, its state-of-the-art and future aspirations will be reviewed. Specifically, the significance and limitations of structural MRI to detect gross morphological tissue changes in relation to clinical presentation will be discussed. The more recent application of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional and resting-state MRI (fMRI \& R-fMRI) will be contrasted in relation to these more conventional MRI assessments. Finally, future aspirations will be sketched out in providing a more disease mechanism-based molecular MRI. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review will equip the reader with an overview of the application of MRI to ALS and illustrate its potential to develop biomarkers. This discussion is exemplified by key studies, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each modality. The reader will gain an expert opinion on both the current and future developments of MR imaging in ALS. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: MR imaging generates potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic monitoring biomarkers of ALS. The emerging fusion of structural, functional and potentially molecular imaging will improve our understanding of wider cerebral connectivity and holds the promise of biomarkers sensitive to the earliest changes.",

    abstract = "Epilepsy is a brain disorder usually associated with abnormal cortical and/or subcortical functional networks. Exploration of the abnormal network properties and localization of the brain regions involved in human epilepsy networks are critical for both the understanding of the epilepsy networks and planning therapeutic strategies. Currently, most localization of seizure networks come from ictal EEG observations. Functional MRI provides high spatial resolution together with more complete anatomical coverage compared with EEG and may have advantages if it can be used to identify the network(s) associated with seizure onset and propagation. Epilepsy networks are believed to be present with detectable abnormal signatures even during the interictal state. In this study, epilepsy networks were investigated using resting-state fMRI acquired with the subjects in the interictal state. We tested the hypothesis that social network theory applied to resting-state fMRI data could reveal abnormal network properties at the group level. Using network data as input to a classification algorithm allowed separation of medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients from normal control subjects indicating the potential value of such network analyses in epilepsy. Five local network properties obtained from 36 anatomically defined ROIs were input as features to the classifier. An iterative feature selection strategy based on the classification efficiency that can avoid 'over-fitting' is proposed to further improve the classification accuracy. An average sensitivity of 77.2\% and specificity of 83.86\% were achieved via 'leave one out' cross validation. This finding of significantly abnormal network properties in group level data confirmed our initial hypothesis and provides motivation for further investigation of the epilepsy process at the network level.",

    abstract = "The brain is a complex dynamic system of functionally connected regions. Graph theory has been successfully used to describe the organization of such dynamic systems. Recent resting-state fMRI studies have suggested that inter-regional functional connectivity shows a small-world topology, indicating an organization of the brain in highly clustered sub-networks, combined with a high level of global connectivity. In addition, a few studies have investigated a possible scale-free topology of the human brain, but the results of these studies have been inconclusive. These studies have mainly focused on inter-regional connectivity, representing the brain as a network of brain regions, requiring an arbitrary definition of such regions. However, using a voxel-wise approach allows for the model-free examination of both inter-regional as well as intra-regional connectivity and might reveal new information on network organization. Especially, a voxel-based study could give information about a possible scale-free organization of functional connectivity in the human brain. Resting-state 3 Tesla fMRI recordings of 28 healthy subjects were acquired and individual connectivity graphs were formed out of all cortical and sub-cortical voxels with connections reflecting inter-voxel functional connectivity. Graph characteristics from these connectivity networks were computed. The clustering-coefficient of these networks turned out to be much higher than the clustering-coefficient of comparable random graphs, together with a short average path length, indicating a small-world organization. Furthermore, the connectivity distribution of the number of inter-voxel connections followed a power-law scaling with an exponent close to 2, suggesting a scale-free network topology. Our findings suggest a combined small-world and scale-free organization of the functionally connected human brain. The results are interpreted as evidence for a highly efficient organization of the functionally connected brain, in which voxels are mostly connected with their direct neighbors forming clustered sub-networks, which are held together by a small number of highly connected hub-voxels that ensure a high level of overall connectivity.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND:Recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated that there is an intrinsically organized default mode network (DMN) in the resting brain, primarily made up of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Several previous studies have found that the DMN is minimally disturbed during different resting-state conditions with limited cognitive demand. However, this conclusion was drawn from the visual inspection of the functional connectivity patterns within the DMN and no statistical comparison was performed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Four resting-state fMRI sessions were acquired: 1) eyes-closed (EC) (used to generate the DMN mask); 2) EC; 3) eyes-open with no fixation (EO); and 4) eyes-open with a fixation (EO-F). The 2-4 sessions were counterbalanced across participants (n = 20, 10 males). We examined the statistical differences in both functional connectivity and regional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) within the DMN among the 2-4 resting-state conditions (i.e., EC, EO, and EO-F). Although the connectivity patterns of the DMN were visually similar across these three different conditions, we observed significantly higher functional connectivity and ALFF in both the EO and the EO-F conditions as compared to the EC condition. In addition, the first and second resting EC conditions showed significant differences within the DMN, suggesting an order effect on the DMN activity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Our findings of the higher DMN connectivity and regional spontaneous activities in the resting state with the eyes open suggest that the participants might have more non-specific or non-goal-directed visual information gathering and evaluation, and mind wandering or daydreaming during the resting state with the eyes open as compared to that with the eyes closed, thus providing insights into the understanding of unconstrained mental activity within the DMN. Our results also suggest that it should be cautious when choosing the type of a resting condition and designating the order of the resting condition in multiple scanning sessions in experimental design.",

    abstract = "Purpose: Electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) coregistration has recently revealed that several brain structures are involved in generalized spike and wave discharges (GSWDs) in idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGEs). In particular, deactivations and activations have been observed within the so-called brain default mode network (DMN) and thalamus, respectively. In the present study we analyzed the dynamic time course of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) changes preceding and following 3 Hz GSWDs in a group of adolescent and adult patients with IGE who presented with absence seizures (AS). Our aim was to evaluate cortical BOLD changes before, during, and after GSWD onset. Methods: Twenty-one patients with IGE underwent EEG-fMRI coregistration. EEG-related analyses were run both at the single-subject and at group level (random effect). The time-course analysis was conducted for 3 s time windows before, during, and after GSWDs, and they were included until no further BOLD signal changes were observed. Key Findings: Fifteen patients (nine female, mean age 28 years) had GSWDs during EEG-fMRI coregistration (262 total events, mean duration 4 s). Time-course group analysis showed BOLD increments starting approximately 10 s before GSWD onset located in frontal and parietal cortical areas, and especially in the precuneus-posterior cingulate region. At GSWD onset, BOLD increments were located in thalamus, cerebellum, and anterior cingulate gyrus, whereas BOLD decrements were observed in the DMN regions persisting until 9 s after onset. Significance: Hemodynamic changes (BOLD increments) occurred in specific cortical areas, namely the precuneus/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, and frontal cortices, several seconds before EEG onset of GSWD. A dysfunction of these brain regions, some of which belongs to the DMN, may be crucial in generating GSWDs in patients with IGE",

A 10-session behavioral treatment, the modified Story Memory Technique (mSMT), was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Behavioral improvements and increased fMRI activation were shown after treatment. Here, connectivity within the neural networks underlying memory function was examined with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in a subset of participants from the clinical trial. We hypothesized that the treatment would result in increased integrity of connections within two primary memory networks of the brain, the hippocampal memory network, and the default network (DN). Seeds were placed in left and right hippocampus, and the posterior cingulate cortex. Increased connectivity was found between left hippocampus and cortical regions specifically involved in memory for visual imagery, as well as among critical hubs of the DN.

    title = "{ABERRANT AMYGDALA-FRONTAL CORTEX CONNECTIVITY DURING PERCEPTION OF FEARFUL FACES AND AT REST IN GENERALIZED SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is characterized by exaggerated amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat, but if and how the amygdala interacts with functionally and anatomically connected prefrontal cortex (PFC) remains largely unknown. Recent evidence points to aberrant amygdala connectivity to medial PFC in gSAD at rest, but it is difficult to attribute functional relevance without the context of threat processing. Here, we address this by studying amygdala-frontal cortex connectivity during viewing of fearful faces and at rest in gSAD patients. METHODS: Twenty patients with gSAD and 17 matched healthy controls (HCs) participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging of an emotional face matching task and a resting state task. Functional connectivity and psychophysiological interaction analysis were used to assess amygdala connectivity. RESULTS: Compared to HCs, gSAD patients exhibited less connectivity between amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while viewing fearful faces. gSAD patients also showed less connectivity between amygdala and rostral ACC at rest in the absence of fearful faces. DLPFC connectivity was negatively correlated with LSAS(Fear) (where LSAS is Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale). CONCLUSIONS: Task and rest paradigms provide unique and important information about discrete and overlapping functional networks. In particular, amygdala coupling to DLPFC may be a phasic abnormality, emerging only in the presence of a social predictor of threat, whereas amygdala coupling to the rostral ACC may reflect both phasic and tonic abnormalities. These findings prompt further studies to better delineate intrinsic and externally evoked brain connectivity in anxiety and depression in relation to amygdala dysfunction",

Recent advances in systems neuroscience-based approaches to brain dysfunction have facilitated the development of models of ADHD pathophysiology that encompass a number of different large-scale resting-state networks. Here we review progress in delineating large-scale neural systems and illustrate their relevance to ADHD. We relate frontoparietal, dorsal attentional, motor, visual and default networks to the ADHD functional and structural literature.

    abstract = "Functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI data are rapidly emerging as highly efficient and powerful tools for in vivo mapping of functional networks in the brain, referred to as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Despite a burgeoning literature, researchers continue to struggle with the challenge of defining computationally efficient and reliable approaches for identifying and characterizing ICNs. Independent component analysis (ICA) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring ICNs in both healthy and clinical populations. In particular, temporal concatenation group ICA (TC-GICA) coupled with a back-reconstruction step produces participant-level resting state functional connectivity maps for each group-level component. The present work systematically evaluated the test-retest reliability of TC-GICA derived RSFC measures over the short-term (<45 min) and long-term (5-16 months). Additionally, to investigate the degree to which the components revealed by TC-GICA are detectable via single-session ICA, we investigated the reproducibility of TC-GICA findings. First, we found moderate-to-high short- and long-term test-retest reliability for ICNs derived by combining TC-GICA and dual regression. Exceptions to this finding were limited to physiological- and imaging-related artifacts. Second, our reproducibility analyses revealed notable limitations for template matching procedures to accurately detect TC-GICA based components at the individual scan level. Third, we found that TC-GICA component's reliability and reproducibility ranks are highly consistent. In summary, TC-GICA combined with dual regression is an effective and reliable approach to exploratory analyses of resting state fMRI data.",

    abstract = "We review two complementary MRI imaging modalities to characterize structure and function of neuronal networks in the human brain, and their application to subjects with severe brain injury. The structural imaging modality, diffusion tensor imaging, is based on imaging the diffusion of water protons in the brain parenchyma. From the diffusion tensor, several quantities characterizing fiber structure in the brain can be derived. The principal direction of the diffusion tensor has been found to depend on the fiber direction of myelinated axons. It can be used for white matter fiber tracking. The anisotropy (or directional dependence) of diffusion has been shown to be sensitive to developmental as well as white matter changes during training and recovery from brain injury. The functional MRI imaging modality, resting state fMRI, concerns the functional connectivity of neuronal networks rather than their anatomical structure. Subjects undergo a conventional fMRI imaging protocol without performing specific tasks. Various resting state network patterns can be computed by algorithms that reveal correlations in the fMRI signal. Often, thalamic structures are involved, suggesting that resting state fMRI could reflect global brain network functionality. Clinical applications of resting state fMRI have been reported, in particular relating signal abnormalities to neurodegenerative processes. To better understand to which degree resting state patterns reflect neuronal network function, we are comparing network patterns of normal subjects with those having severe brain lesions in a small pilot study.",

Here we developed a novel ROI-based multivariate statistical framework to obtain the fine-grained patterns of functionally specialized brain networks in the resting state. Under this framework, the weighted-RV method is proposed and used to detect the spatial fine-scale patterns of functional connectivity. This approach overcomes several major problems of the traditional resting-state data analysis methods such as Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis. By using simulation and real fMRI experiment, we have found that the weighted-RV method is shown to be more sensitive in detecting the fine-scale based low-frequency connectivity even at a very low functional contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and this method can achieve much better performance in mapping the fine-grained patterns of functionally specialized brain networks compared to the traditional methods.",

Since emerging data imply the importance of right cerebellar function for language acquisition in typical development, we hypothesized that PT subjects would have alternate areas of cerebellar connectivity, and that these areas would be responsible for differences in cognitive outcomes between PT subjects and term controls at age 20years. Nineteen PT and 19 term control young adults were prospectively studied using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to create voxel-based contrast maps reflecting the functional connectivity of each tissue element in the grey matter through analysis of the intrinsic connectivity contrast degree (ICC-d). Left cerebellar ICC-d differences between subjects identified a region of interest that was used for subsequent seed-based connectivity analyses. Subjects underwent standardized language testing, and correlations with cognitive outcomes were assessed. There were no differences in gender, hand preference, maternal education, age at study, or Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) scores. Functional connectivity (FcMRI) demonstrated increased tissue connectivity in the biventer, simple and quadrangular lobules of the L cerebellum (p<0.05) in PTs compared to term controls; seed-based analyses from these regions demonstrated alterations in connectivity from L cerebellum to both R and L inferior frontal gyri (IFG) in PTs compared to term controls. For PTs but not term controls, there were significant positive correlations between these connections and PPVT scores (R IFG: r=0.555, p=0.01; L IFG: r=0.454, p=0.05), as well as Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) scores (R IFG: r=0.472, p=0.04). These data suggest the presence of a left cerebellar language circuit in PT subjects at young adulthood. These findings may represent either a delay in maturation or the engagement of alternative neural pathways for language in the developing PT brain",

A total of 22 criminal psychopathic men and 22 control subjects were assessed and fMRI maps were generated to identify (i) brain response to moral dilemmas, (ii) task-induced deactivation of the network during a conventional cognitive task and (iii) the strength of functional connectivity within the network during resting-state. The obtained functional brain maps indeed confirmed that the network subserving moral judgment is underactive in psychopathic individuals during moral dilemma situations, but the data also provided evidence of a baseline network alteration outside moral contexts with a functional disconnection between emotional and cognitive elements that jointly construct moral judgment. The finding may have significant social implications if considering psychopathic behavior to be a result of a primary breakdown in basic brain systems.",

This small animal model used electric (rather than visual) stimulation and allowed DW-fMRI experiments to be performed over a broader range of acquisition parameters than previous work on humans and cats. Resting state experiments with injections of ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) were also used to investigate the effects of gradient coupling on the signal change. The experiments were performed over five b-values (0, 200, 800, 1400 and 2000s/mm(2)) and three echo-times (30, 60 and 90 ms). Alterations to the stimulation-induced response with respect to TE and b-value were evaluated in two intervals: the positive stimulus-correlated response (5-20s after stimulus onset) and the post-stimulus undershoot (27-40s). There was no strong dependence of the signal change on b-value for any of the intervals or TEs. Similarly, changes to the apparent transverse relaxation rate showed no clear dependence on b-value. In contrast to previous DW-fMRI studies, the simplest explanation for the observed data is a single-compartment signal model with the functional signal changes probably corresponding to extravascular SE-BOLD. Experiments with USPIO suggested that at 7 T and within the range of parameters used, the influence of gradient coupling may be sufficient to explain minor DW-fMRI signal changes.",

ICA analysis revealed 5 typical brain networks among which the so-called default mode network and the sensori-motor network showed distinct differences between patients and controls. The default mode network showed less activation in patients in several regions including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and the left and right inferior parietal cortex, regions that have been linked previously to executive functions. The sensori-motor network showed group differences in the premotor cortex. We propose that resting state analysis affords a new and simple means to assess disease-related neurofunctional alterations in widespread brain networks. A decisive advantage is that no task is demanded from the subjects and, thus, the problem of differential task difficulty and effort between groups is circumvented",

Group independent component analysis (Group ICA) was applied to fMRI data from 15 AD patients and 16 normal healthy elderly controls (NC) to derive the dorsal attention network (DAN) and the ventral attention network (VAN) which are respectively responsible for the endogenous attention orienting ("top-down") process and the exogenous attention re-orienting ("bottom-up") process. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for activity in core regions within each of these networks. Functional connectivity analysis revealed disrupted DAN and preserved (less impaired) VAN in AD patients compared with NC, which might indicate impairment of a "top-down" and intact "bottom-up" attentional processing mechanisms in AD. ROC curve analysis suggested that activity in the left intraparietal sulcus and left frontal eye field from DAN as well as the posterior cingulate cortex from the DMN could serve as sensitive and specific biomarkers distinguishing AD from NC.

It was found that the temporal correlation strength but not amplitude of baseline BOLD signal fluctuations acquired under the eyes-fixed condition is positively correlated with the amplitude of stimulus-evoked BOLD responses across subjects. Moreover, the spatiotemporal correlations of baseline BOLD signals imply a coherent network covering the visual system, which is topographically indistinguishable from the "resting-state visual network" observed under the eyes-closed condition. The overall findings suggest that the synchronization of ongoing brain activity plays an important role in determining stimulus-evoked brain activity even at an early stage of the sensory system. The tight relationship between baseline BOLD correlation and stimulus-evoked BOLD amplitude provides an essential basis for understanding and interpreting the large inter-subject BOLD variability commonly observed in numerous fMRI studies and potentially for improving group fMRI analysis.

    abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A "resting state" or "default mode network" has been highlighted in functional neuroimaging studies as a set of brain regions showing synchronized activity at rest or in task-independent cognitive state.STATE OF THE ART: A considerable and increasing number of studies have been conducted over the last few years so as to unravel the cognitive function(s) of this brain network.PERSPECTIVES: This review gives an overview of anatomical, physiological and phenomenological data regarding the default mode network. Different hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of this network. Several studies have highlighted its involvement in autobiographical memory, prospection, self, attention, and theory of mind. The influence of the attention level and consciousness onto resting state brain network activity has also been discussed. Specific changes have been described in normal aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS).CONCLUSIONS: These studies altogether contribute to a better definition of the default mode network, in terms of implicated brain structures, subtending mechanisms, and potential cognitive roles. For instance, similarities and relationships were found between self-related brain activity and resting-state activity in regions belonging to this network, namely posterior cingulate and prefrontal areas that may reflect introspective activity experienced, more or less consciously, when the brain is not specifically engaged in a cognitive task. As a whole, the default mode network appears as a non human-specific intrinsic functional network, active all over the life from birth until aging where it is progressively modified, and sensitive to different pathologies including AD and MS. On the other hand, many points remain to be clarified concerning this network, such as the exact part of its activity dedicated to self-related cognitive processes (introspection, imaginary mental scenario based on past autobiographical experiences) and that involved in a sentinel-like attentional process designated to react to possible environmental events. Indeed, it seems that this network is functional even in case of low level of consciousness, i.e., during light sleep. Conversely, a loss of self and environment perception as in coma, deep sleep or anesthesia might modulate its connectivity along the anteroposterior axis, i.e., frontal activity disappearance associated with a parietal reinforcement of connectivity. Since studies aiming at highlighting these points are still uncommon to date, exhaustive and objective explorations are needed to better understand all these resting state processes},

By modeling the frequency power spectrum of resting-state brain signals with a power-law function \$\$O$\backslash$left(f$\backslash$right)$\backslash$propto $\backslash$frac\{1\}\{\{f\}\^{}\{$\backslash$hbox\{ $\backslash$alpha \}\}\}\$\$, the power-law exponent $\alpha$ has been shown to relate to the connectivity patterns of spontaneous brain activity that forms so-called rs-fMRI networks in the human adult brain. Here, we present an analysis of the dynamic properties of rs-fMRI and EEG signals acquired both in the newborn and adult brain, and we demonstrate frequency scaling of a power-law kind for orders of magnitude in the hemodynamic (0.01-0.15 Hz) and the electrical (0.2-30 Hz) domain. We show that the spatial segregation of resting-state dynamics of intrinsic fMRI signals in terms of the power-law exponent $\alpha$ is closely related to previously delineated resting-state neuronal architecture that encompasses primary sensory cortices and associate cortex in newborns. Moreover, the spatial profiles of differences in temporal dynamics for rs-fMRI signals could also be observed in EEG measurements in the newborn brain, albeit at a coarser spatial scale, with larger power-law exponents in occipital and parietal cortices compared with signals from the frontal brain",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This case series assesses the effects of five consecutive days of low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with and without a 6-Hz primer. Although this paper studies able-bodied individuals, similar rTMS protocols are used to facilitate motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. However, the cortical mechanisms associated with repeated daily doses of rTMS are not completely understood. CASE DESCRIPTION: Four right-handed healthy volunteers (two men, aged 20-50 years) participated in a double-blind case series of primed and unprimed rTMS. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare task-related haemodynamics during a simple motor task and resting-state cortical connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms of repeated rTMS sessions may serve as a precursor to development of rTMS paradigms involving motor cortex stimulation in patients with a range of neurologic dysfunction. OUTCOMES: Following five consecutive days of rTMS, all subjects had reduced task-related haemodynamics. Resting-state brain connectivity between motor regions was reduced only after primed rTMS. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to indicate that resting-state brain connectivity can distinguish the effect of primed and unprimed rTMS to a greater extent than task-related haemodynamics. Furthermore, priming may inhibit the connectivity between the area of the cortex underlying the rTMS site and remote brain regions. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings benefit rTMS rehabilitation studies by examining haemodynamics on repeated days of stimulation and incorporating resting-state brain connectivity analysis to further understand underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, this work encourages the utilization of resting connectivity in future rTMS studies. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",

    abstract = {PURPOSE: To illustrate a functional interpretation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes associated with generalized spike-and-wave discharges in patients with absence seizures and to demonstrate the reproducibility of these findings in one case.METHODS: In a 47 year-old patient with frequent absence seizures, BOLD signal changes during generalized spike-and-wave discharges (GSWD) were mapped by using simultaneous and continuous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 1.5 T and 6 months later at 3 T. GSWDs were modeled as individual events and as blocks.RESULTS: The patient studied exhibited frequent generalized spike-wave activity with temporal properties ideal for study with EEG/fMRI. Highly reproducible GSWD-associated fMRI signal decreases (deactivations) were seen in bilateral frontal and temporoparietal cortices and the precuneus, in addition to activations in occipital cortex and, at 3 T, the posterior thalamus.CONCLUSIONS: The GSWD-associated changes seen here involve cortical regions that have been shown to be more active at conscious rest compared with sleep and with various types of extroverted perception and action. These regions have been proposed to constitute the core of a functional "default mode" system. We propose that the findings of deactivation of this distributed brain system during GSWDs mirrors the clinical manifestation of GSWDs (i.e., absence seizures). Furthermore, we suggest that these deactivations may reflect the functional consequences of GSWDs on physiologic brain activity at rest rather than direct hemodynamic correlates of epileptic discharges.},

We selected 18 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent a 2-h simultaneous EEG-fMRI and had unilateral or bilateral independent TL spikes for interindividual group analysis, in order to identify consistent blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses to TL spikes.METHODS: EEG was postprocessed and spikes were visually identified. fMRI data were preprocessed with motion correction, spatial smoothing, and removal of low frequency drifts. Spike timings were used as events for fMRI statistical analysis. Four hemodynamic response functions were used to account for variability in the BOLD response.RESULTS: Group analysis revealed common areas of BOLD activations and deactivations. The hemodynamic response function (HRF) peaking 3 s after the spike showed activation involving ipsilaterally the mesial temporal structures (presumably the hippocampus), putamen/globus pallidus, inferior insula, and superior temporal gyrus. The HRF peaking at 5 s showed activations involving ipsi- and contralaterally the superior temporal gyrus and inferior insula. Both HRFs showed bilateral posterior cingulate deactivations.DISCUSSION: We disclosed involvement of a network of activated areas during unilateral TL spikes, including ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, basal ganglia, and bilateral neocortical temporal regions. Despite the low temporal resolution of fMRI we demonstrated that contralateral temporal involvement occurred later than ipsilateral activation. This contralateral change took place in the absence of visible EEG changes. The posterior cingulate deactivation may reflect the interconnections between this region and other limbic structures. It may also partially correspond to a suspension of the default mode network, as previously described for TL spikes",

    abstract = "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been widely used to study structural and functional brain connectivity in recent years. A common assumption used in many previous functional brain connectivity studies is the temporal stationarity. However, accumulating literature evidence has suggested that functional brain connectivity is under temporal dynamic changes in different time scales. In this paper, a novel and intuitive approach is proposed to model and detect dynamic changes of functional brain states based on multimodal fMRI/DTI data. The basic idea is that functional connectivity patterns of all fiber-connected cortical voxels are concatenated into a descriptive functional feature vector to represent the brain's state, and the temporal change points of brain states are decided by detecting the abrupt changes of the functional vector patterns via the sliding window approach. Our extensive experimental results have shown that meaningful brain state change points can be detected in task-based fMRI/DTI, resting state fMRI/DTI, and natural stimulus fMRI/DTI data sets. Particularly, the detected change points of functional brain states in task-based fMRI corresponded well to the external stimulus paradigm administered to the participating subjects, thus partially validating the proposed brain state change detection approach. The work in this paper provides novel perspective on the dynamic behaviors of functional brain connectivity and offers a starting point for future elucidation of the complex patterns of functional brain interactions and dynamics",

    abstract = "Many researchers have noted that the functional architecture of the human brain is relatively invariant during task performance and the resting state. Indeed, intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) revealed by resting-state functional connectivity analyses are spatially similar to regions activated during cognitive tasks. This suggests that patterns of task-related activation in individual subjects may result from the engagement of one or more of these ICNs; however, this has not been tested. We used a novel analysis, spatial multiple regression, to test whether the patterns of activation during an N-back working memory task could be well described by a linear combination of ICNs delineated using Independent Components Analysis at rest. We found that across subjects, the cingulo-opercular Set Maintenance ICN, as well as right and left Frontoparietal Control ICNs, were reliably activated during working memory, while Default Mode and Visual ICNs were reliably deactivated. Further, involvement of Set Maintenance, Frontoparietal Control, and Dorsal Attention ICNs was sensitive to varying working memory load. Finally, the degree of left Frontoparietal Control network activation predicted response speed, while activation in both left Frontoparietal Control and Dorsal Attention networks predicted task accuracy. These results suggest that a close relationship between resting-state networks and task-evoked activation is functionally relevant for behavior, and that spatial multiple regression analysis is a suitable method for revealing that relationship.

This baseline is characterized by slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of functional imaging signals that are topographically organized in discrete brain networks, and by much faster (1-80 Hz) electrical oscillations. To investigate the relationship between hemodynamic and electrical oscillations, we have adopted a completely data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using independent component analysis on the fMRI data, we identified six widely distributed resting state networks. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations associated with each network were correlated with the EEG power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. Each functional network was characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature that involved the combination of different brain rhythms. Moreover, the joint EEG/fMRI analysis afforded a finer physiological fractionation of brain networks in the resting human brain. This result supports for the first time in humans the coalescence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks as suggested by biophysical studies.",

The present study examines the intrinsic effective connectivity of top-down motor control in stroke survivors (n=13) relative to healthy participants (n=12). Stroke survivors exhibited significant deficits in motor function, as assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) of resting-state fMRI data to investigate the relationship between motor deficits and the intrinsic effective connectivity between brain regions involved in motor control and motor execution. An exploratory adaptation of SEM determined the optimal model of motor execution effective connectivity in healthy participants, and confirmatory SEM assessed stroke survivors' fit to that model. We observed alterations in spontaneous resting-state effective connectivity from fronto-parietal guidance systems to the motor network in stroke survivors. More specifically, diminished connectivity was found in connections from the superior parietal cortex to primary motor cortex and supplementary motor cortex. Furthermore, the paths demonstrated large individual variance in stroke survivors but less variance in healthy participants. These findings suggest that characterizing the deficits in resting-state connectivity of top-down processes in stroke survivors may help optimize cognitive and physical rehabilitation therapies by individually targeting specific neural pathway.",

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of recency judgments, judgments of the relative temporal order of two studied items, have highlighted the involvement of the lateral prefrontal and medial temporal regions. However, the parietal cortical contribution to recency judgments has rarely been highlighted. To examine the parietal involvement, in this study, we conducted a re-analysis to increase the statistical power using three data sets (N=73) from our previous fMRI studies of recency judgments. Recency judgments can be achieved by at least two mechanisms, relational and item-based ones. It has been revealed that the left hippocampus/parahippocampal region is related to relational recency judgments, and that the right anterior temporal region is related to item-based recency judgments. We examined whether the parietal cortex is involved in these two types of recency judgments. Significant brain activity related to relational recency judgments was observed in the left ventral parietal region and, as reported previously, the left parahippocampal region. On the other hand, significant brain activity related to item-based recency judgments was observed in the left dorsal parietal region and, as reported previously, the right anterior temporal region. Furthermore, correlation analyses of resting-state BOLD signals detected significant correlations between the ventral parietal region and the parahippocampal region, as well as between the dorsal parietal region and anterior temporal region.

A disruption in the connectivity between brain processes may underlie this schism. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were used to evaluate functional and anatomical brain connectivity in schizophrenia. METHODS: In all, 29 chronic schizophrenia patients (11 females, age: mean=41.3, SD=9.28) and 29 controls (11 females, age: mean=41.1, SD=10.6) were recruited. Schizophrenia patients were assessed for severity of negative and positive symptoms and general cognitive abilities of attention/concentration and memory. Participants underwent a resting-fMRI scan and a DTI scan. For fMRI data, a hybrid independent components analysis was used to extract the group default mode network (DMN) and accompanying time-courses. Voxel-wise whole-brain multiple regressions with corresponding DMN time-courses was conducted for each subject. A t-test was conducted on resulting DMN correlation maps to look between-group differences. For DTI data, voxel-wise statistical analysis of the fractional anisotropy data was carried out to look for between-group differences. Voxel-wise correlations were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain connectivity and behavioral measures. RESULTS: Results revealed altered functional and anatomical connectivity in medial frontal and anterior cingulate gyri of schizophrenia patients. In addition, frontal connectivity in schizophrenia patients was positively associated with symptoms as well as with general cognitive ability measures. DISCUSSION: The present study shows convergent fMRI and DTI findings that are consistent with the disconnection hypothesis in schizophrenia, particularly in medial frontal regions, while adding some insight of the relationship between brain disconnectivity and behavior",

    abstract = "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by striatal dopamine depletion, especially in the posterior putamen. The dense connectivity profile of the striatum suggests that these local impairments may propagate throughout the whole cortico-striatal network. Here we test the effect of striatal dopamine depletion on cortico-striatal network properties by comparing the functional connectivity profile of the posterior putamen, the anterior putamen, and the caudate nucleus between 41 PD patients and 36 matched controls. We used multiple regression analyses of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to quantify functional connectivity across different networks. Each region had a distinct connectivity profile that was similarly expressed in patients and controls: the posterior putamen was uniquely coupled to cortical motor areas, the anterior putamen to the pre-supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate cortex, and the caudate nucleus to the dorsal prefrontal cortex. Differences between groups were specific to the putamen: although PD patients showed decreased coupling between the posterior putamen and the inferior parietal cortex, this region showed increased functional connectivity with the anterior putamen. We conclude that dopamine depletion in PD leads to a remapping of cerebral connectivity that reduces the spatial segregation between different cortico-striatal loops. These alterations of network properties may underlie abnormal sensorimotor integration in PD.",

We examined in humans the effects of motor learning using fMRI measures of functional connectivity under resting conditions and found persistent changes in networks involving both motor and somatosensory areas of the brain. We developed a technique that allows us to distinguish changes in functional connectivity that can be attributed to motor learning from those that are related to perceptual changes that occur in conjunction with learning. Using this technique, we identified a new network in motor learning involving second somatosensory cortex, ventral premotor cortex, and supplementary motor cortex whose activation is specifically related to perceptual changes that occur in conjunction with motor learning. We also found changes in a network comprising cerebellar cortex, primary motor cortex, and dorsal premotor cortex that were linked to the motor aspects of learning. In each network, we observed highly reliable linear relationships between neuroplastic changes and behavioral measures of either motor learning or perceptual function. Motor learning thus results in functionally specific changes to distinct resting-state networks in the brain.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine resting-state default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity in patients with treatment-resistant IGE. METHODS: Treatment resistance was defined as continuing seizures despite an adequate dose of valproic acid (valproate, VPA). Data from 60 epilepsy patients and 38 healthy controls who underwent simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were included (EEG/fMRI). Independent component analysis (ICA) and dual regression were used to quantify DMN connectivity. Confirmatory analysis using seed-based voxel correlation was performed. KEY FINDINGS: There was a significant reduction of DMN connectivity in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy when compared to patients who were treatment responsive and healthy controls. Connectivity was negatively correlated with duration of epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings in this large sample of patients with IGE indicate the presence of reduced DMN connectivity in IGE and show that connectivity is further reduced in treatment-resistant epilepsy. DMN connectivity may be useful as a biomarker for treatment resistance",

Previous behavioral studies using a gambling task were able to differentiate patients with lesions in this region from normal subjects. In the present imaging study, this region, among others, was shown to be "spontaneously" activated during three different cognitive states: a gambling task, a working memory task, and resting state. SCR data were simultaneously collected during the scanning process. Six subjects were scanned at 1.5 T during all three states, and one subject was scanned at 3 T during the resting state only. SCR data were used as a reference function for correlation analysis with the fMRI time series during each of the three tasks. SCR changes were evident during the gambling and two-back tasks as well as during rest. SCR activity was not observed to be specifically related to reward-based decisions in the gambling task. Correlation of the fMRI time series directly with the SCR data revealed a consistent set of activated regions. The activity of these regions showing correlation with the SCR appeared independent of the cognitive state. Further, the subject scanned only at rest (without the possible confound of task-related carryover activity) replicated the findings in the original six subjects. From these data, SCR appears to be a marker of a network that is active during, but independent of, the task being studied.},

    abstract = "Negotiation and trade typically require a mutual interaction while simultaneously resting in uncertainty which decision the partner ultimately will make at the end of the process. Assessing already during the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques, we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70\% when we predicted online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of objective financial incentives.",

Abnormal function in the DMN has been reported in people with schizophrenia but it is not known whether this applies also to people with a familial risk for psychosis (FR). We compared the activity of the DMN between FR participants and controls. METHODS: We conducted a resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI) in 72 young adults without psychosis and with a history of psychosis in one or both parents (FR group) and 72 age matched controls without parental psychosis, and without current psychosis or a current prodromal syndrome. Both groups were drawn from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (Oulu Brain and Mind study). Parental psychosis was established using the Finnish hospital discharge register. We pre-processed R-fMRI data using independent component analysis followed by a dual regression approach to assess differences between the groups. The FR vs. Control group differences were assessed using non-parametric permutation tests utilizing threshold-free cluster enhancement and correcting for multiple comparisons (p<0.05). RESULTS: FR participants demonstrated significantly lower activity compared with controls in the posterior cingulate cortex, the central node of the DMN. The size of the region was 41mm(3). CONCLUSION: The activity of the DMN differed between FR and control groups. This suggests that familial risk for psychotic disorders may be mediated through genetic effects on connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex",

In one, we obtained morning and evening resting-state fMRI scans to assess changes in functional brain organization. In the second experiment, we obtained quantitative PET measures of glucose and oxygen consumption to assess the cost of wake. We found selective changes in brain organization. Most prominently bilateral medial temporal regions were locally connected in the morning, but in the evening exhibited strong correlations with frontal and parietal brain regions involved in memory retrieval. We speculate that these changes may reflect aspects of memory consolidation recurring on a daily basis. Surprisingly, these changes in brain organization occurred without increases in brain metabolism",

Here we mapped correlations in resting-state activity between the human thalamus and the cerebral cortex in adult humans using fMRI BOLD imaging. Based on this functional measure of intrinsic brain activity we partitioned the thalamus into nuclear groups that correspond well with postmortem human histology and connectional anatomy inferred from nonhuman primates. This structure/function correspondence in resting-state activity was strongest between each cerebral hemisphere and its ipsilateral thalamus. However, each hemisphere was also strongly correlated with the contralateral thalamus, a pattern that is not attributable to known thalamocortical monosynaptic connections. These results extend our understanding of the intrinsic network organization of the human brain to the thalamus and highlight the potential of resting-state fMRI BOLD imaging to elucidate thalamocortical relationships.",

Previous studies have also found that differing experimental conditions such as eyes-open versus eyes-closed can produce measurable changes in the DMN. These condition-associated changes have the potential of confounding the measurements of changes in RSNs related to or caused by disease state(s). In this study, we use fMRI measurements of resting-state connectivity paired with EEG measurements of alpha rhythm and employ independent component analysis, undirected graphs of partial spectral coherence, and spatiotemporal regression to investigate the effect of music-listening on RSNs and the DMN in particular. We observed similar patterns of DMN connectivity in subjects who were listening to music compared with those who were not, with a trend toward a more introspective pattern of resting-state connectivity during music-listening.

Here we propose a two-step analytic strategy. First, we construct connectivity-distance profiles, which summarize the connectivity of each voxel in the brain as a function of distance from the seed, a functional relationship that has attracted much recent interest. Next, these profile functions are regressed on predictors of interest, whether categorical (e.g., acquisition site or diagnostic group) or continuous (e.g., age). This procedure can provide insight into the roles of multiple sources of variation, and detect large-scale patterns not easily available from conventional analyses.

We previously used concurrent single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that individuals with schizophrenia have a decreased spTMS-evoked response in the thalamus, and decreased effective connectivity between thalamus and insula and thalamus and superior frontal gyrus. To better understand the factors that may accompany or account for these findings, we investigated, in the same participants, resting state functional connectivity, white matter structural connectivity and grey matter integrity. Patients with schizophrenia did not differ from healthy control subjects in resting state functional or white matter structural connectivity although they did show decreased measures of grey matter integrity in the insula. However, in this region, the spTMS-evoked response did not differ between groups. In a region of the thalamus that also had grey matter intensity abnormalities, although not at a level that survived correction for multiple comparisons, the spTMS-evoked response in patients was deficient. Overall, these results suggest that measures of structure and function are not necessarily complementary. Further, given its sensitivity for identifying deficits not evident with traditional imaging methods, these results highlight the utility of spTMS-fMRI, a method that directly and causally probes effective connectivity, as a tool for studying brain-based disorders",

One potential factor contributing to individual differences among the elders is the cognitive reserve, which designates the partial protection from the deleterious effects of aging that lifetime experience provides. Neuroimaging studies examining task-related activation in elderly people suggested that cognitive reserve takes the form of more efficient use of brain networks and/or greater ability to recruit alternative networks to compensate for age-related cerebral changes. In this exploratory multi-centre study, we examined the relationships between cognitive reserve, as measured by education and verbal intelligence, and cerebral metabolism at rest (FDG-PET) in a sample of 74 healthy older participants. Higher degree of education and verbal intelligence was associated with less metabolic activity in the right posterior temporoparietal cortex and the left anterior intraparietal sulcus. Functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI images in a subset of 41 participants indicated that these regions belong to the default mode network and the dorsal attention network respectively. Lower metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex was also associated with better memory abilities. The findings provide evidence for an inverse relationship between cognitive reserve and resting-state activity in key regions of two functional networks respectively involved in internal mentation and goal-directed attention",

Based on increased recognition of the dimensional nature of autistic traits, the authors examined the neural correlates of these traits in neurotypical individuals using the SRS-A and established a novel approach to assessing the neural basis of autistic characteristics, attempting to directly relate SRS-A scores to patterns of functional connectivity observed in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region commonly implicated in social cognition.METHOD: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 25 neurotypical adults. All participants provided SRS-A ratings completed by an informant who had observed them in natural social settings. Whole brain-corrected connectivity analyses were then conducted using SRS-A scores as a covariate of interest.RESULTS: Across participants, a significant negative relationship between SRS-A scores and the functional connectivity of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex with the anterior portion of the mid-insula was found. Specifically, low levels of autistic traits were observed when a substantial portion of the anterior mid-insula showed positive connectivity with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. In contrast, elevated levels of autistic traits were associated with negative connectivity between these two regions.CONCLUSIONS: Resting state functional connectivity of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex-insula social network was related to autistic traits in neurotypical adults. Application of this approach in samples with autism spectrum disorders is needed to confirm whether this circuit is dimensionally related to the severity of autistic traits in clinical populations",

In this study we compared two methods: a 'rest-like' method where the functional connectivity was estimated for the whitened residuals after regressing out the task-induced effects, and a within-condition method where the functional connectivity was estimated separately for each experimental condition. In both cases four pre-processing strategies were used: 1) time courses extracted from standard pre-processed data (standard); 2) adjusted time courses extracted using the volume of interest routines in SPM2 from standard pre-processed data (spm); 3) time courses extracted from ICA denoised data (standard denoised); and 4) adjusted time courses extracted from ICA denoised data (spm denoised). The temporal correlation between time series extracted from two cortical regions were statistically compared with the temporal correlation between a time series extracted from a cortical region and a time series extracted form a region placed in CSF. Since the later correlation is due to physiological noise and other artifacts, we used this comparison to investigate whether rest-like and task modulated connectivity could be estimated from the same data set. The pre-processing strategy had a significant effect on the connectivity estimates with the standard time courses providing larger connectivity values than the spm time courses for both estimation methods. The CSF comparison indicated that for our data set only rest-like connectivity could be estimated. The rest-like connectivity values were similar with connectivity estimated from resting state data.",

DESIGN:Using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 33 healthy young men while they performed the Sternberg working memory task following a normal night of sleep and again following 30 hours of sleep deprivation. From this initial group, based on their Sternberg working memory task performance, we found 10 subjects resilient to sleep deprivation (sleep deprivation-resilient group) and then selected 10 age- and education-matched subjects vulnerable to sleep deprivation (sleep deprivation-vulnerable group). SETTING:Inpatient General Clinical Research Center and outpatient functional magnetic resonance imaging center. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS:Data from 10 young men (mean age 27.8 +/- 1.7 years) in the sleep deprivation-resilient group and 10 young men (mean age 28.2 +/- 1.9 years) in the sleep deprivation-vulnerable group were included in the final analyses. INTERVENTIONS:None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD signal at rested baseline and sleep deprivation states in the 2 groups. As hypothesized, following sleep deprivation, both groups showed significant decreases in global brain activation compared to their rested group baseline. At rested baseline and in the sleep-deprivation state, the sleep deprivation-resilient group had significantly more brain activation than did the sleep deprivation-vulnerable group. There were also differences in functional circuits within and between groups in response to sleep deprivation. CONCLUSIONS:These preliminary data suggest that patterns of brain activation during the Sternberg working memory task at the rested baseline and the sleep-deprivation state, differ across individuals as a function of their sleep-deprivation vulnerability.",

Using a combined approach we measured spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal along with electroencephalography (EEG) in eleven healthy subjects during relaxed wakefulness (eyes closed). In contrast to other studies which used the EEG frequency information to guide the functional MRI (fMRI) analysis, we opted for transient EEG events, which identify and quantify brain electric microstates as time epochs with quasi-stable field topography. We then used this microstate information as regressors for the BOLD fluctuations. Single trial EEGs were segmented with a specific module of the LORETA (low resolution electromagnetic tomography) software package in which microstates are represented as normalized vectors constituted by scalp electric potentials, i.e., the related 3-dimensional distribution of cortical current density in the brain. Using the occurrence and the duration of each microstate, we modeled the hemodynamic response function (HRF) which revealed BOLD activation in all subjects. The BOLD activation patterns resembled well known resting-state networks (RSNs) such as the default mode network. Furthermore we "cross validated" the data performing a BOLD independent component analysis (ICA) and computing the correlation between each ICs and the EEG microstates across all subjects. This study shows for the first time that the information contained within EEG microstates on a millisecond timescale is able to elicit BOLD activation patterns consistent with well known RSNs, opening new avenues for multimodal imaging data processing.},

    abstract = {Task-based neuroimaging studies face the challenge of developing tasks capable of equivalently probing reading networks across different age groups. Resting-state fMRI, which requires no specific task, circumvents these difficulties. Here, in 25 children (8-14 years) and 25 adults (21-46 years), we examined the extent to which individual differences in reading competence can be related to resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of regions implicated in reading. In both age groups, reading standard scores correlated positively with RSFCbetween the left precentral gyrusandothermotorregions, andbetweenBroca's andWernicke's areas.Thissuggeststhat,regardless of age group, stronger coupling among motor regions,as wellasbetween language/speech regions, subserves better reading, presumably reflecting automatized articulation. We also observed divergent RSFC-behavior relationships in children and adults, particularly those anchored in the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) (the visual word form area). In adults, but not children, better reading performance was associated with stronger positive correlations between FFG and phonology-related regions (Broca's area and the left inferior parietal lobule), and with stronger negative relationships between FFG and regions of the "task-negative" default network. These results suggest that both positive RSFC (functional coupling) between reading regions and negative RSFC (functional segregation) between a reading region and default network regions are important for automatized reading, characteristic of adult readers. Together, our task-independent RSFC findings highlight the importance of appreciating developmental changes in the neural correlates of reading competence, and suggest that RSFC may serve to facilitate the identification of reading disorders in different age groups. © 2011 the authors.},

However, there are sensitivity and specificity-related interpretation issues that must be addressed. METHODS: We assessed the long-range functional and structural connections of the default-mode, attention, visual and motor networks on 25 healthy subjects. For each network, we first integrated these two analyses based on one common seed region. We then introduced a functional-assisted fiber tracking strategy, where seed regions were defined based on independent component analysis of the resting-state fMRI dataset. RESULTS: The single-seed based technique successfully identified the expected functional connections within these networks at both subject and group levels. However, the success rate of structural connectivity analysis showed a high level of variation among the subjects. The functional-assisted fiber tracking strategy highly improved the rate of successful fiber tracking. CONCLUSIONS: This fMRI/DWI integration study suggests that functional connectivity analysis might be a more sensitive and robust approach in understanding the connectivity between cortical regions, and can be used to improve DWI-based structural connectivity analysis",

In this paper we review over a decade of work from our group and others on the use of simulated driving paradigms to study both the healthy brain as well as the effects of acute alcohol administration on functional connectivity during such paradigms. We briefly review our initial work focused on the configuration of the driving simulator and the analysis strategies. We then describe in more detail several recent studies from our group including a hybrid study examining distracted driving and compare resulting data with those from a separate visual oddball task (Fig. 6). The analysis of these data was performed primarily using a combination of group independent component analysis (ICA) and the general linear model (GLM) and in the various studies we highlight novel findings which result from an analysis of either 1) within-network connectivity, 2) inter-network connectivity, also called functional network connectivity, or 3) the degree to which the modulation of the various intrinsic networks were associated with the alcohol administration and the task context. Despite the fact that the behavioral effects of alcohol intoxication are relatively well known, there is still much to discover on how acute alcohol exposure modulates brain function in a selective manner, associated with behavioral alterations. Through the above studies, we have learned more regarding the impact of acute alcohol intoxication on organization of the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks during performance of a complex, real-world cognitive operation. Lessons learned from the above studies have broader applicability to designing ecologically valid, complex, functional MRI cognitive paradigms and incorporating pharmacologic challenges into such studies. Overall, the use of hybrid driving studies is a particularly promising area of neuroscience investigation",

Here, we address for the first time the correlates of this component in an fMRI study of a group of eight patients suffering from diabetic neuropathic pain and eight healthy control subjects. Specifically, we studied the functional connectivity that is associated with spontaneous neuropathic pain with spatial independent component analysis (sICA).PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Functional connectivity analyses revealed a cortical network consisting of two anti-correlated patterns: one includes the left fusiform gyrus, the left lingual gyrus, the left inferior temporal gyrus, the right inferior occipital gyrus, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally, the pre and postcentral gyrus bilaterally, in which its activity is correlated negatively with pain and positively with the controls; the other includes the left precuneus, dorsolateral prefrontal, frontopolar cortex (both bilaterally), right superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, thalami, both insulae, inferior parietal lobuli, right mammillary body, and a small area in the left brainstem, in which its activity is correlated positively with pain and negatively with the controls. Furthermore, a power spectra analyses revealed group differences in the frequency bands wherein the sICA signal was decomposed: patients' spectra are shifted towards higher frequencies.CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have characterized here for the first time a functional network of brain areas that mark the spontaneous component of NP.

The same vermal and hemispheric subregions showed either different patterns or different strengths of rsFCs with the cerebrum, and different subregions of lobules VII and VIII displayed different rsFC patterns. Region of interest (ROI)-based analyses also confirmed these findings. Specifically, strong rsFCs were found: between lobules I-VI and vermal VIIb-IX and the visual network; between hemispheric VI, VIIb, VIIIa and the auditory network; between lobules I-VI, VIII and the sensorimotor network; between lobule IX, vermal VIIIb and the default-mode network; between lobule Crus I, hemispheric Crus II and the fronto-parietal network; between hemispheric VIIb, VIII and the task-positive network; between hemispheric VI, VIIb, VIII and the salience network; between most cerebellar subregions and the thalamus; between lobules V, VIIb and the midbrain red nucleus; between hemispheric Crus I, Crus II, vermal VIIIb, IX and the caudate nucleus; between lobules V, VI, VIIb, VIIIa and the pallidum and putamen; and between lobules I-V, hemispheric VIII, IX and the hippocampus and amygdala.

In contrast to this false dichotomy, we propose a new view of consciousness as an interactive, plastic phenomenon open to sociocultural influence. We take up our account of consciousness from the observation of radical cortical neuroplasticity in human development. Accordingly, we draw upon recent research on macroscopic neural networks, including the "default mode," to illustrate cases in which an individual's particular "connectome" is shaped by encultured social practices that depend upon and influence phenomenal and reflective consciousness. On our account, the dynamically interacting connectivity of these networks bring about important individual differences in conscious experience and determine what is "present" in consciousness. Further, we argue that the organization of the brain into discrete anti-correlated networks supports the phenomenological distinction of prereflective and reflective consciousness, but we emphasize that this finding must be interpreted in light of the dynamic, category-resistant nature of consciousness. Our account motivates philosophical and empirical hypotheses regarding the appropriate time-scale and function of neuroplastic adaptation, the relation of high and low-frequency neural activity to consciousness and cognitive plasticity, and the role of ritual social practices in neural development and cognitive function},

    abstract = "Coherent fluctuations of spontaneous brain activity are present in distinct functional-anatomic brain systems during undirected wakefulness. However, the behavioral significance of this spontaneous activity has only begun to be investigated. Our previous studies have demonstrated that successful memory formation requires coordinated neural activity in a distributed memory network including the hippocampus and posteromedial cortices, specifically the precuneus and posterior cingulate (PPC), thought to be integral nodes of the default network. In this study, we examined whether intrinsic connectivity during the resting state between the hippocampus and PPC can predict individual differences in the performance of an associative memory task among cognitively intact older individuals. The intrinsic connectivity, between regions within the hippocampus and PPC that were maximally engaged during a subsequent memory fMRI task, was measured during a period of rest prior to the performance of the memory paradigm. Stronger connectivity between the hippocampal and posteromedial regions during rest predicted better performance on the memory task. Furthermore, hippocampal-PPC intrinsic connectivity was also significantly correlated with episodic memory measures on neuropsychological tests, but not with performance in non-memory domains. Whole-brain exploratory analyses further confirmed the spatial specificity of the relationship between hippocampal-default network posteromedial cortical connectivity and memory performance in older subjects. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that one of the functions of this large-scale brain network is to subserve episodic memory processes. Research is ongoing to determine if impaired connectivity between these regions may serve as a predictor of memory decline related to early Alzheimer's disease.",

In the present study, we hypothesized that the pattern of functional asymmetry in schizophrenia may differ between patients suffering from positive and negative symptoms. We examined the relationship between altered asymmetry of functional connectivity and symptom type (positive/negative) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus as regions of interest, and analyzed functional connectivity patterns between these and other brain regions. Furthermore, a voxel-based two-level asymmetry analysis was conducted to investigate differences in the asymmetry of functional connectivity patterns within and between groups. Our results showed that patients exhibiting positive symptoms had significantly increased leftward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The negative symptom group, in contrast, exhibited increased rightward asymmetry of functional connectivity. The strength of the asymmetry in these regions was found to be significantly correlated with symptom ratings obtained using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. These results suggest that predominantly positive and predominantly negative schizophrenia may have different neural underpinnings, and that certain regions in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the cingulate gyrus and precuneus, play important roles in mediating the symptoms of this complex disease. Our study also provided further evidence for the hypothesis that schizophrenia is related to abnormalities in functional brain networks.",

    abstract = "Despite the use of cholinergic therapies in Alzheimer's disease and the development of cholinergic strategies for schizophrenia, relatively little is known about how the system modulates the connectivity and structure of large-scale brain networks. To better understand how nicotinic cholinergic systems alter these networks, this study examined the effects of nicotine on measures of whole-brain network communication efficiency. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from fifteen healthy subjects before and after the application of nicotine or placebo transdermal patches in a single blind, crossover design. Data, which were previously examined for default network activity, were analyzed with network topology techniques to measure changes in the communication efficiency of whole-brain networks. Nicotine significantly increased local efficiency, a parameter that estimates the network's tolerance to local errors in communication. Nicotine also significantly enhanced the regional efficiency of limbic and paralimbic areas of the brain, areas which are especially altered in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. These changes in network topology may be one mechanism by which cholinergic therapies improve brain function",

    abstract = "Functional connectivity mapping with resting state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an immensely powerful technique, providing insight into both normal cognitive function and disruptions linked to neurological disorders. Traditionally, connectivity is mapped using data from an entire scan (minutes), but it is well known that cognitive processes occur on much shorter time scales (seconds). Recent studies have demonstrated that the correlation between the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI signal from different areas varies over time, motivating further exploration of these fluctuations in apparent connectivity. However, it has also been shown that similar changes in correlation can arise when the timing relationships between voxels are randomized (Handwerker et al., 2012). In this work, we show that functional connectivity in the anesthetized rat exhibits dynamic properties similar to those previously observed in awake humans (Chang and Glover, 2010) and anesthetized monkeys (Hutchison, Womelsdorf et al., 2012). Sliding window correlation between BOLD time courses obtained from bilateral cortical and subcortical ROIs results in periods of variable positive and negative correlation for most pairs of areas except homologous areas in opposite hemispheres, which exhibit primarily positive correlation. Comparison with sliding window correlation of randomly-matched time courses suggests that with the exception of homologous areas and sensorimotor connections, the dynamics cannot be distinguished from random fluctuations in correlation over time, supporting the idea that these dynamic patterns may be due to inherent properties of the signal rather than variations in neural coherence. Within the pairs of areas where the dynamics are most different from those of randomly-matched time courses, ten common patterns of connectivity are identified and their occurrence as a function of time plotted for all animals. The observation of time-varying correlation in the rodent model will facilitate the future multimodal experiments needed to determine whether the changes in apparent connectivity are linked to underlying neural variability",

Recent evidence suggests that individual differences in human behavior may be related to the strength of functional connectivity of large-scale functional networks as measured by spontaneous fluctuations in regional brain activity during quiet wakefulness (the "resting state"), in the absence of task performance. In this study, we sought to determine whether individual differences in memory performance could be predicted by the interhemispheric functional connectivity of the two hippocampi, hypothesized to reflect the intrinsic connectivity within the large-scale medial temporal lobe memory system. Results demonstrated that interhemispheric hippocampal functional connectivity during quiet wakefulness was predictive of the capacity to freely recall recently learned information (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). In contrast, functional connectivity of bilateral motor cortices had no relationship to free recall, supporting the specificity of the hippocampal data. Thus, individual differences in the capacity to perform episodic memory tasks, which may be persistent behavioral traits or transient states, may be at least partly subserved by individual differences in the functional connectivity of large-scale functional-anatomic memory networks.},

    abstract = {Deactivation refers to increased neural activity during low-demand tasks or rest compared with high-demand tasks. Several groups have reported that a particular set of brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex, among others, is consistently deactivated. Taken together, these typically deactivated brain regions appear to constitute a default-mode network of brain activity that predominates in the absence of a demanding external task. Examining a passive, block-design sensory task with a standard deactivation analysis (rest epochs vs. stimulus epochs), we demonstrate that the default-mode network is undetectable in one run and only partially detectable in a second run. Using independent component analysis, however, we were able to detect the full default-mode network in both runs and to demonstrate that, in the majority of subjects, it persisted across both rest and stimulus epochs, uncoupled from the task waveform, and so mostly undetectable as deactivation. We also replicate an earlier finding that the default-mode network includes the hippocampus suggesting that episodic memory is incorporated in default-mode cognitive processing. Furthermore, we show that the more a subject's default-mode activity was correlated with the rest epochs (and "deactivated" during stimulus epochs), the greater that subject's activation to the visual and auditory stimuli. We conclude that activity in the default-mode network may persist through both experimental and rest epochs if the experiment is not sufficiently challenging. Time-series analysis of default-mode activity provides a measure of the degree to which a task engages a subject and whether it is sufficient to interrupt the processes--presumably cognitive, internally generated, and involving episodic memory--mediated by the default-mode network},

However, functional imaging enables the formulation of neurobiological hypotheses that can be tested clinically and is suited to test classical clinical hypotheses about how the brain works. Understanding the mechanisms and the site of pathology, e.g., in cluster headaches, will lead and has led to new therapeutic strategies. New methodological developments for neuroscientific applications are aimed at the integration of functional and morphological connectivity through a combination of magnetic resonance techniques (fMRI, DTI) and electrophysiological (EEG, MEG) recordings.

    abstract = "Survival-relevant information has privileged access to our awareness even during active cognitive engagement. Previous work has demonstrated that during working memory (WM) negative emotional distraction disrupts activation in the lateral prefrontal regions while also engaging the amygdala. Here, using slow event-related fMRI, we replicate and extend previous work examining the effect of negative emotional distraction on WM: (1) We demonstrate that prefrontal regions showed activation differences between correct and incorrect trials during negative, but not neutral, distraction. Specifically, frontopolar prefrontal cortex showed more deactivation for incorrect trials faced with negative distraction, whereas ventrolateral prefrontal regions showed less activation; (2) individual differences in amygdala activity predicted WM performance during negative as well as neutral distraction, such that lower activity predicted better performance; and (3) amygdala showed negative correlations with prefrontal and parietal cortical regions during resting state. However, during negative distraction, amygdala signals were more negatively correlated with prefrontal cortical regions than was found for resting state and neutral distraction. These results provide further evidence for an inverse relationship between dorsal prefrontal cortical regions and the amygdala when processing aversive stimuli competes with ongoing cognitive operations, and further support the importance of the prefrontal cortex in resisting emotional interference.

    abstract = "Functional connectivity (FC) analysis is a prominent approach to analyzing fMRI data, especially acquired under the resting state condition. The commonly used linear correlation FC measure bears an implicit assumption of Gaussianity of the dependence structure. If only the marginals, but not all the bivariate distributions are Gaussian, linear correlation consistently underestimates the strength of the dependence. To assess the suitability of linear correlation and the general potential of nonlinear FC measures, we present a framework for testing and estimating the deviation from Gaussianity by means of comparing mutual information in the data and its Gaussianized counterpart. We apply this method to 24 sessions of human resting state fMRI. For each session, matrix of connectivities between 90 anatomical parcel time series is computed using mutual information and compared to results from its multivariate Gaussian surrogate that conserves the correlations but cancels any nonlinearity. While the group-level tests confirmed non-Gaussianity in the FC, the quantitative assessment revealed that the portion of mutual information neglected by linear correlation is relatively minor-on average only about 5\% of the mutual information already captured by the linear correlation. The marginality of the non-Gaussianity was confirmed in comparisons using clustering of the parcels-the disagreement between clustering obtained from mutual information and linear correlation was attributable to random error. We conclude that for this type of data, practical relevance of nonlinear methods trying to improve over linear correlation might be limited by the fact that the data are indeed almost Gaussian.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most neuroimaging studies of resting state networks have concentrated on functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous correlation in a single network. In this study we investigated both FC and effective connectivity (EC) based on Granger causality of four important networks at resting state derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging data - default mode network (DMN), hippocampal cortical memory network (HCMN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal control network (FPCN).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: A method called correlation-purged Granger causality analysis was used, not only enabling the simultaneous evaluation of FC and EC of all networks using a single multivariate model, but also accounting for the interaction between them resulting from the smoothing of neuronal activity by hemodynamics. FC was visualized using a force-directed layout upon which causal interactions were overlaid. FC results revealed that DAN is very tightly coupled compared to the other networks while the DMN forms the backbone around which the other networks amalgamate. The pattern of bidirectional causal interactions indicates that posterior cingulate and posterior inferior parietal lobule of DMN act as major hubs. The pattern of unidirectional causal paths revealed that hippocampus and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) receive major inputs, likely reflecting memory encoding/retrieval and cognitive integration, respectively. Major outputs emanating from anterior insula and middle temporal area, which are directed at aPFC, may carry information about interoceptive awareness and external environment, respectively, into aPFC for integration, supporting the hypothesis that aPFC-seeded FPCN acts as a control network.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate the following. First, regions whose activities are not synchronized interact via time-delayed causal influences. Second, the causal interactions are organized such that cingulo-parietal regions act as hubs. Finally, segregation of different resting state networks is not clear cut but only by soft boundaries.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: . Recent studies have shown that focal injuries can have remote effects on network function that affect behavior, but these network-wide repercussions are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: . This study tested the hypothesis that lesions specifically to the outflow tract of a distributed network can result in upstream dysfunction in structurally intact portions of the network. In the somatomotor system, this upstream dysfunction hypothesis predicted that lesions of the corticospinal tract might be associated with functional disruption within the system. Motor impairment might then reflect the dual contribution of corticospinal damage and altered network functional connectivity. METHODS: . A total of 23 subacute stroke patients and 13 healthy controls participated in the study. Corticospinal tract damage was quantified using a template of the tract generated from diffusion tensor imaging in healthy controls. Somatomotor network functional integrity was determined by resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: . The extent of corticospinal damage was negatively correlated with interhemispheric resting functional connectivity, in particular with connectivity between the left and right central sulcus. Although corticospinal damage accounted for much of the variance in motor performance, the behavioral impact of resting connectivity was greater in subjects with mild or moderate corticospinal damage and less in those with severe corticospinal damage. CONCLUSIONS: . Our results demonstrated that dysfunction of cortical functional connectivity can occur after interruption of corticospinal outflow tracts and can contribute to impaired motor performance. Recognition of these secondary effects from a focal lesion is essential for understanding brain-behavior relationships after injury, and they may have important implications for neurorehabilitation",

However, it is not known how these drugs affect the intrinsic large-scale interactions of the brain (resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity). In this study, the effect of low-dose S(+)-ketamine on intrinsic brain connectivity was investigated. METHODS:: Twelve healthy, male volunteers received a 2-h intravenous S(+)-ketamine infusion (first hour 20 mg/70 kg, second hour 40 mg/70 kg). Before, during, and after S(+)-ketamine administration, resting-state brain connectivity was measured. In addition, heat pain tests were performed between imaging sessions to determine ketamine-induced analgesia. A mixed-effects general linear model was used to determine drug and pain effects on resting-state brain connectivity. RESULTS:: Ketamine increased the connectivity most importantly in the cerebellum and visual cortex in relation to the medial visual network. A decrease in connectivity was observed in the auditory and somatosensory network in relation to regions responsible for pain sensing and the affective processing of pain, which included the amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex. Connectivity variations related to fluctuations in pain scores were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and the brainstem, regions involved in descending inhibition of pain. CONCLUSIONS:: Changes in connectivity were observed in the areas that explain ketamine's pharmacodynamic profile with respect to analgesia and psychedelic and other side effects.

Antero-mesial temporal structures are the site of early pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease and have been shown to be critical for declarative memory. Our study aimed at exploring the functional impact of basal connectivity of an anterior temporal network (ATN) on declarative memory. A heterogeneous group of subjects with varying performance on tasks assessing memory was therefore selected, including healthy subjects and patients with isolated memory complaint, amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using Independent Component Analysis on resting-state fMRI, we extracted a relevant anterior temporal network (ATN) composed of the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, the hippocampal head, the amygdala and the lateral temporal cortex extending to the temporal pole. A default mode network and an executive-control network were also selected to serve as control networks. We first compared basal functional connectivity of the ATN between patients and control subjects. Relative to controls, patients exhibited significantly increased functional connectivity in the ATN during rest. Specifically, voxel-based analysis revealed an increase within the inferior and superior temporal gyrus and the uncus. In the patient group, positive correlations between averaged connectivity values of ATN and performance on anterograde and retrograde object-based memory tasks were observed, while no correlation was found with other evaluated cognitive measures. These correlations were specific to the ATN, as no correlation between performance on memory tasks and the other selected networks was found. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that basal connectivity inside the ATN network has a functional role in object-related, context-free memory. They also suggest that increased connectivity at rest within the ATN could reflect compensatory mechanisms that occur in response to early pathological insult.",

    abstract = "The recent discovery of a circuit of brain regions that is highly active in the absence of overt behavior has led to a quest for revealing the possible function of this so-called default-mode network (DMN). A very recent study, finding similarities in awake humans and anesthetized primates, has suggested that DMN activity might not simply reflect ongoing conscious mentation but rather a more general form of network dynamics typical of complex systems. Here, by performing functional MRI in humans, it is shown that a natural, sleep-induced reduction of consciousness is reflected in altered correlation between DMN network components, most notably a reduced involvement of frontal cortex. This suggests that DMN may play an important role in the sustenance of conscious awareness",

However, its practical applicability in the clinical realms is still questionable. Here we report three consecutive followed-up resting-state fMRI data in a single case with Wernicke encephalopathy before and after high-dose thiamine replacement therapy ranging over 20 months. We measured the mammillothalamic functional connectivity strength between the first ROI (mammillary body) and a voxel which showed the highest co-activation among voxels within the anterior thalamus (the second ROI) to enhance the specificity of the functional connectivity data. We found that the time-series changes in the mammillothalamic functional connectivity generally paralleled to the changes in delayed verbal and nonverbal recall memory scores in the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Among these, the left-side connectivity and delayed verbal recall score seemed to be related to the overall clinical status change. Modified directed transfer function (dDTF) analysis also identified significant information flows with mammillary-to-thalamic direction except at the acute illness state. Our findings, though preliminary in nature, suggest the practical applicability of resting-state fMRI to trace an effect of thiamine replacement therapy on the memory tract function in Wernicke encephalopathy at single-patient level.",

    abstract = "Objects along a route can help us to successfully navigate through our surroundings. Previous neuroimaging research has shown that the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) distinguishes between objects that were previously encountered at navigationally relevant locations (decision points) and irrelevant locations (nondecision points) during simple object recognition. This study aimed at unraveling how this neural marking of objects relevant for navigation is established during learning and postlearning rest. Twenty-four participants were scanned using fMRI while they were viewing a route through a virtual environment. Eye movements were measured, and brain responses were time-locked to viewing each object. The PHG showed increased responses to decision point objects compared with nondecision point objects during route learning. We compared functional connectivity between the PHG and the rest of the brain in a resting state scan postlearning with such a scan prelearning. Results show that functional connectivity between the PHG and the hippocampus is positively related to participants' self-reported navigational ability. On the other hand, connectivity with the caudate nucleus correlated negatively with navigational ability. These results are in line with a distinction between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations in the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, respectively. Our results thus suggest a relation between navigational ability and a neural preference for a specific type of spatial representation. Together, these results show that the PHG is immediately involved in the encoding of navigationally relevant object information. Furthermore, they provide insight into the neural correlates of individual differences in spatial ability.",

    abstract = "Abstract The default mode network (DMN) is a unique idea that attracts many neuroimaging researchers to examine alterations in the resting-state brain physiology in normal aging and psychiatric and neurological disorders predominantly by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In dementias, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the recent topics in an imaging domain is depicting its pathological substance, $\beta$-amyloid protein (A$\beta$) in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). This A$\beta$ accumulation was not only discovered in AD but also frequently in cognitively normal people. Indeed, there is evidence that subjects with high A$\beta$ deposition tend to be considered as those who are very likely to develop AD in the future. Recent reports also show that the DMN in AD patients is affected in conjunction with A$\beta$ deposition. Our recent study of the cognitive and physiological impact of A$\beta$ accumulation on the DMN function in normal elderly people using PET has shown that the amount of A$\beta$ deposits is negatively correlated with the DMN function, and the lower function of the DMN is associated with poorer working memory performance. As expected, A$\beta$ deposition in the brain, however minute the degree of its accumulation can be, may cause neuronal discoordination in the DMN along with poor working memory in normal aging. As literature on fMRI-based DMN activity is profuse, here, we discuss the pathophysiological aspect of the DMN from a molecular imaging viewpoint",

For decades, striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) dysfunction has been implied in bradykinesia and rigidity, but does not explain resting tremor in PD. To understand the roles of cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) and STC circuits in the pathophysiology of the heterogeneous clinical presentation of PD, we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 17 right-handed PD patients [nine tremor predominant (PDT) and eight akinetic-rigidity predominant (PDAR)] and 14 right-handed controls while they performed internally-guided (IG) sequential finger tapping tasks. The percentage of voxels activated in regions constituting the STC and CTC [divided as cerebellar hemisphere-thalamo-cortical (CHTC) and vermis-thalamo-cortical (CVTC)] circuits was calculated. Multivariate analysis of variance compared the activation patterns of these circuits between study groups. Compared to controls, both PDAR and PDT subjects displayed an overall increase in the percentage of voxels activated in both STC and CTC circuits. These increases reached statistical significance in contralateral STC and CTC circuits for PDT subjects, and in contralateral CTC pathways for PDAR subjects. Comparison of PDAR and PDT subjects revealed significant differences in ipsilateral STC (P=0.005) and CTC (P=0.043 for CHTC and P=0.003 for CVTC) circuits. These data support the differential involvement of STC and CTC circuits in PD subtypes, and help explain the heterogeneous presentation of PD symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of integrating CTC circuits in understanding PD and other disorders of the basal ganglia.",

    abstract = {Noninvasive parcellation of the human cerebral cortex is an important goal for understanding and examining brain functions. Recently, the patterns of anatomical connections using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been used to parcellate brain regions. Here, we present a noninvasive parcellation approach that uses "functional fingerprints" obtained by correlation measures on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to parcellate brain regions. In other terms, brain regions are parcellated based on the similarity of their connection--as reflected by correlation during resting state--to the whole brain. The proposed method was used to parcellate the medial frontal cortex (MFC) into supplementary motor areas (SMA) and pre-SMA subregions. In agreement with anatomical landmark-based parcellation, we find that functional fingerprint clustering of the MFC results in anterior and posterior clusters. The probabilistic maps from 12 subjects showed that the anterior cluster is mainly located rostral to the vertical commissure anterior (VCA) line, whereas the posterior cluster is mainly located caudal to VCA line, suggesting the homologues of pre-SMA and SMA. The functional connections from the putative pre-SMA cluster were connected to brain regions which are responsible for complex/cognitive motor control, whereas those from the putative SMA cluster were connected to brain regions which are related to the simple motor control. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of the functional connectivity-based parcellation of the human cerebral cortex using resting state fMRI.},

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Connectivity mapping based on resting-state fMRI is rapidly developing, and this methodology has great potential for clinical applications. However, before resting-state fMRI can be applied for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment for an individual patient with neurologic or psychiatric diseases, it is essential to assess its long-term reproducibility and betweensubject variations among healthy individuals. The purpose of the study was to quantify the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures derived from resting-state fMRI and to assess the between- subject variation of ICN measures across the whole brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal resting-state fMRI data of 6 healthy volunteers were acquired from 9 scan sessions during >1 year. The within-subject reproducibility and between-subject variation of ICN measures, across the whole brain and major nodes of the DMN, were quantified with the ICC and COV. RESULTS: Our data show that the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures is outstanding, with >70\% of the connectivity networks showing an ICC > 0.60. The COV across 6 healthy volunteers in this sample was >0.2, suggesting significant between-subject variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that resting-state ICN measures (eg, the correlation coefficients between fMRI signal-intensity profiles from 2 different brain regions) are potentially suitable as biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects in clinical trials and individual patients. Because between-subject variation is significant, it may be difficult to use quantitative ICN measures in their current state as a diagnostic tool.",

    abstract = {Apathy and depression are heterogeneous syndromes with symptoms that overlap clinically. This clinical overlap leads to problems with classification and diagnosis in clinical populations. No functional imaging study has attempted to separate brain regions altered in apathy from those altered in depression in a clinical population. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disorder in which apathy and depression co-exist in a single population. We evaluate the relationship between apathy, depression, and motor severity of disease in PD, focusing on the relationship between these factors and the amplitude of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting state. We first evaluated if the resting ALFF signal is a reliable measure for our clinical question. For this, we develop and introduce a cross validation approach we term the "Regional Mapping of Reliable Differences" (RMRD) method to evaluate reliability of regions of interest deemed "significant" by standard voxel-wise techniques. Using this approach, we show that the apathy score in this sample is best predicted by ALFF signal in the left supplementary motor cortex, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the right middle frontal cortex, whereas depression score is best predicted by ALFF signal in the right subgenual cingulate. Disease severity was best predicted by ALFF signal in the right putamen. A number of additional regions are also statistically (but not reliably) correlated with our neuropsychological measures and disease severity. Our results support the use of resting fMRI as a means to evaluate neuropsychiatric states and motor disease progression in Parkinson disease, and the clinical and epidemiologic observation that apathy and depression are distinct pathological entities. Our finding that "significance" and "reliability" are dissociated properties of regions of interest identified as significant using standard voxel-wise techniques suggests that including reliability analyses may add useful scientific information in neurobehavioral research.},

Connectivity occurs between the posterior and anterior portions of the default network, a group of structures active in the absence of a task, including the posterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus. Previous studies found weaker posterior-anterior connectivity in the default network in adults and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, these studies used small a priori regions of interest ("seeds") to calculate connectivity. Since seed location for all participants was chosen based on controls' brains, these studies' analyses are more tailored to controls than individuals with ASD. An alternative is to use a data-driven approach, such as self-organizing maps (SOM), to create a reference for each participant to calculate connectivity. We used individualized resting-state clusters identified by an SOM algorithm to corroborate previous findings of weaker posterior-anterior connectivity in the ASD group and examine age-related changes in the ASD and control groups. Thirty-nine adolescents with ASD and 41 controls underwent a 10-minute, eyes-open, resting-state functional MRI scan. The SOM analysis revealed that adolescents with ASD versus controls have weaker connectivity between the posterior hub of the default network and the right superior frontal gyrus. Additionally, controls have larger increases in connectivity with age compared to the ASD group. These findings indicate that SOM is a complementary method for calculating connectivity in a clinical population. Additionally, adolescents with ASD have a different developmental trajectory of the default network compared to controls},

These sensations are atypical, arising from sub-dermal receptors, and their neural encoding is not well known. In this fMRI study, subjects were stimulated at acupoint PC-6, while rating sensation with a custom-built, MR-compatible potentiometer. Separate runs included real (ACUP) and sham (SHAM) acupuncture, the latter characterized by non-insertive, cutaneous stimulation. FMRI data analysis was guided by the on-line rating timeseries, thereby localizing brain correlates of acupuncture sensation. Sensation ratings correlated with stimulation more (p<0.001) for SHAM (r=0.63) than for ACUP (r=0.32). ACUP induced stronger and more varied sensations with significant persistence into no-stimulation blocks, leading to more run-time spent rating low and moderate sensations compared to SHAM. ACUP sensation correlated with activation in regions associated with sensorimotor (SII, insula) and cognitive (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)) processing, and deactivation in default-mode network (DMN) regions (posterior cingulate, precuneus). Compared to SHAM, ACUP yielded greater activity in both anterior and posterior dmPFC and dlPFC. In contrast, SHAM produced greater activation in sensorimotor (SI, SII, insula) and greater deactivation in DMN regions. Thus, brain encoding of ACUP sensation (more persistent and varied, leading to increased cognitive load) demonstrated greater activity in both cognitive/evaluative (posterior dmPFC) and emotional/interoceptive (anterior dmPFC) cortical regions. Increased cognitive load and dmPFC activity may be a salient component of acupuncture analgesia--sensations focus attention and accentuate bodily awareness, contributing to enhanced top-down modulation of any nociceptive afference and central pain networks. Hence, acupuncture may function as a somatosensory-guided mind-body therapy",

    abstract = "Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) of the brain has the potential to elicit networks of functional connectivity and to reveal changes thereof in animal models of neurological disorders. In the present study, we investigate the contribution of physiological noise and its impact on assessment of functional connectivity in rs-fMRI of medetomidine sedated, spontaneously breathing rats at ultrahigh field of 11.7 Tesla. We employed gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) with repetition times of 3s and used simultaneous recordings of physiological parameters. A model of linear regression was applied to quantify the amount of BOLD fMRI signal fluctuations attributable to physiological sources. Our results indicate that physiological noise - mainly originating from the respiratory cycle -dominates the rs-fMRI time course in the form of spatially complex correlation patterns. As a consequence, these physiological fluctuations introduce severe artifacts into seed-based correlation maps and lead to misinterpretation of corresponding connectivity measures. We demonstrate that a scheme of motion correction and linear regression can significantly reduce physiological noise in the rs-fMRI time course, remove artifacts, and hence improve the reproducibility of functional connectivity assessment. In conclusion, physiological noise can severely compromise functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) of the rodent at high fields and must be carefully considered in design and interpretation of future studies. Motion correction should be considered the primary strategy for reduction of apparent motion related to respiratory fluctuations. Combined with subsequent regression of physiological confounders, this strategy has proven successful in reducing physiological noise and related artifacts affecting functional connectivity analysis. The proposed new and rigorous protocol now opens the potential of fcMRI to elicit the role of brain connectivity in pathological processes without concerns of confounding contributions from physiological noise.",

    abstract = "Neuroimaging studies of professional athletic or musical training have demonstrated considerable practice-dependent plasticity in various brain structures, which may reflect distinct training demands. In the present study, structural and functional brain alterations were examined in professional badminton players and compared to healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI. Gray matter concentration (GMC) was assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and resting-brain functions were measured by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity. Results showed that the athlete group had greater GMC and ALFF in the right and medial cerebellar regions, respectively. The athlete group also demonstrated smaller ALFF in the left superior parietal lobule and altered functional connectivity between the left superior parietal and frontal regions. These findings indicate that badminton expertise is associated with not only plastic structural changes in terms of enlarged gray matter density in the cerebellum, but also functional alterations in fronto-parietal connectivity. Such structural and functional alterations may reflect specific experiences of badminton training and practice including high capacity visuo-spatial processing and hand-eye coordination in addition to refined motor skills",

    abstract = "CONTEXT: Disruption of frontal-subcortical and limbic networks is hypothesized to have a key role in late-life depression (LLD) and can be examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Gray matter can be examined using T1-weighted MRI, white matter using T2-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, and functional connectivity in resting-state networks using functional MRI. Although independent MRI studies have supported gray and white matter abnormalities in frontosubcortical and limbic networks and increased functional connectivity in the default-mode network in depression, no study has concurrently examined gray matter, white matter, and functional connectivity.OBJECTIVE: To examine whether results of different MRI techniques are complementary, multimodal MRI was used to compare gray matter, white matter, and resting-state networks between LLD and control groups.DESIGN: Cross-sectional, case-control, multimodal MRI analysis.SETTING: University research department.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six recovered participants with LLD (mean age, 71.8 years) and 25 control participants (mean age, 71.8 years).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gray matter was examined across the whole brain using voxel-based morphometry. Subcortical gray matter structures were also automatically segmented, and volumetric and shape analyses were performed. For white matter analysis, fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity values were examined using tract-based spatial statistics. For resting-state network analysis, correlation coefficients were compared using independent components analysis followed by dual regression.RESULTS: White matter integrity was widely reduced in LLD, without significant group differences in gray matter volumes or functional connectivity.CONCLUSIONS: The present work strongly supports the hypothesis that white matter abnormalities in frontal-subcortical and limbic networks play a key role in LLD even in the absence of changes in resting functional connectivity and gray matter. Factors that could contribute to the lack of significant differences in gray matter and functional connectivity measures, including current symptom severity, medication status, and age of participants with LLD, are discussed",

Using structural and functional brain imaging techniques, a growing number of evolving neuroimaging methods are providing insight into these observed discrepancies at different time-scales. Of these methods, functional magnetic resonance imaging is exploited for short-term evoked pain examination and treatment evaluation; 'resting-state' approaches provide insight into fluctuations in pain; perfusion imaging captures elements of on-going clinical pain; and morphological brain assessment provides evidence for long-term structural changes in the brain associated with chronic pain. Further insight into arthritic pain processing at the brain-systems level could in the future be provided by combined neuroimaging approaches, specifically investigating the interactions between functional and structural alterations",

    abstract = "In this study, we aimed to demonstrate whether spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal derived from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reflect spontaneous neuronal activity in pathological brain regions as well as in regions spared by epileptiform discharges. This is a crucial issue as coherent fluctuations of fMRI signals between remote brain areas are now widely used to define functional connectivity in physiology and in pathophysiology. We quantified functional connectivity using non-linear measures of cross-correlation between signals obtained from intracerebral EEG (iEEG) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) in 5 patients suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Functional connectivity was quantified with both modalities in areas exhibiting different electrophysiological states (epileptic and non affected regions) during the interictal period. Functional connectivity as measured from the iEEG signal was higher in regions affected by electrical epileptiform abnormalities relative to non-affected areas, whereas an opposite pattern was found for functional connectivity measured from the BOLD signal. Significant negative correlations were found between the functional connectivities of iEEG and BOLD signal when considering all pairs of signals (theta, alpha, beta and broadband) and when considering pairs of signals in regions spared by epileptiform discharges (in broadband signal). This suggests differential effects of epileptic phenomena on electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals and/or an alteration of the neurovascular coupling secondary to pathological plasticity in TLE even in regions spared by epileptiform discharges. In addition, indices of directionality calculated from both modalities were consistent showing that the epileptogenic regions exert a significant influence onto the non epileptic areas during the interictal period. This study shows that functional connectivity measured by iEEG and BOLD signals give complementary but sometimes inconsistent information in TLE.",

Thirty-five meditation practitioners and 33 healthy controls without meditation experience were included in this study. All subjects received 4.68-min resting state functional scanning runs. The posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex were chosen as seed regions for the DMN map. Meditation practitioners demonstrated greater functional connectivity within the DMN in the medial prefrontal cortex area (xyz=339-21) than did controls.

In this work, we show results on the predictability of ADHD using imaging biomarkers and discuss the scientific and diagnostic impacts of the research. We created a prediction model using the landmark ADHD 200 data set focusing on resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) and structural brain imaging. We predicted ADHD status and subtype, obtained by behavioral examination, using imaging data, intelligence quotients and other covariates. The novel contributions of this manuscript include a thorough exploration of prediction and image feature extraction methodology on this form of data, including the use of singular value decompositions (SVDs), CUR decompositions, random forest, gradient boosting, bagging, voxel-based morphometry, and support vector machines as well as important insights into the value, and potentially lack thereof, of imaging biomarkers of disease. The key results include the CUR-based decomposition of the rs-fc-fMRI along with gradient boosting and the prediction algorithm based on a motor network parcellation and random forest algorithm. We conjecture that the CUR decomposition is largely diagnosing common population directions of head motion. Of note, a byproduct of this research is a potential automated method for detecting subtle in-scanner motion. The final prediction algorithm, a weighted combination of several algorithms, had an external test set specificity of 94\% with sensitivity of 21\%. The most promising imaging biomarker was a correlation graph from a motor network parcellation. In summary, we have undertaken a large-scale statistical exploratory prediction exercise on the unique ADHD 200 data set. The exercise produced several potential leads for future scientific exploration of the neurological basis of ADHD",

We previously found that resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and striatum is independently associated with nicotine addiction and psychiatric illness. Since the insula is implicated in nicotine dependence, we hypothesized that SZ smokers will have greater dysfunction in smoking-related insular and dACC circuits than normal control smokers (NC) independent of smoking severity, consistent with an inherent disease-related weakening of smoking-related circuits. Nicotine challenge was used to demonstrate that decreased rsFC in identified circuits reflects addiction trait and is not affected by pharmacological state. Twenty-four NC smokers and 20 smokers with SZ matched on nicotine addiction severity participated in a resting state fMRI study and were scanned during two separate sessions while receiving a placebo or nicotine patch, in a randomized, cross-over design. Using individualized, anatomically defined anterior and posterior insula and dACC as regions of interest (ROI), whole brain rsFC was performed using each ROI as a seed. Significant negative correlations between smoking severity and rsFC between insula, dACC and striatum were found for both groups. Furthermore, smokers with SZ demonstrated additive reductions in circuit strength between the dACC and insula compared to NC smokers independent of smoking severity. Nicotine challenge did not significantly alter rsFC in insula-dACC-striatal circuits. Reduced rsFC strength between the insula, dACC and striatum is associated with nicotine addiction severity in both non-psychiatrically ill and in SZ smokers. Decreased insula-dACC rsFC may index overlapping circuitry associated with smoking and SZ",

Blood oxygen level dependent fMRI was performed evaluating encoding-associated signal and resting-state default mode network signal differences between the two risk groups. Neurocognitive testing revealed that the high risk group performed worse on category fluency testing, but the groups were equivalent on all other cognitive measures. During encoding of novel face-name pairs, there were no regions of encoding-associated BOLD activations that were different in the high risk group. Encoding-associated deactivations were greater in magnitude in the low risk group in the medial and right lateral parietal cortex, similar to findings in AD studies. The resting-state DMN analysis demonstrated nine regions in the prefrontal, orbital frontal, temporal and parietal lobes that distinguished the two risk groups. Resting-state DMN analysis could distinguish risk groups with an effect size of 3.35, compared to an effect size of 1.39 using encoding-associated fMRI techniques. Imaging of the resting state avoids performance related variability seen in activation fMRI, is less complicated to acquire and standardize, does not require radio-isotopes, and may be more effective at identifying functional pathology associated with AD risk compared to non-resting fMRI techniques",

To characterize brain dysfunction in TRD, we performed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) on 22 TRD patients, along with 26 matched healthy subjects and 22 patients who were depressed but not treatment-refractory (NDD) as comparison groups. Results were analyzed using a data-driven approach known as Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) analysis which measures the synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels. Relative to healthy controls, both depressed groups showed high ReHo primarily within temporo-limbic structures, and more widespread low ReHo in frontal, parietal, posterior fusiform cortices, and caudate. TRD patients showed more cerebral regions with altered ReHo than did NDD. Moderate but significant correlations between the altered regional ReHo and measures of clinical severity were observed in some identified clusters. These findings shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying TRD and demonstrate the feasibility of using ReHo as a research and clinical tool to monitor persistent cerebral dysfunction in depression, although further work is necessary to compare different measures of brain function to elucidate the neural substrates of these ReHo abnormalities.

    abstract = "We present a technique for predicting cardiac and respiratory phase on a time point by time point basis, from fMRI image data. These predictions have utility in attempts to detrend effects of the physiological cycles from fMRI image data. We demonstrate the technique both in the case where it can be trained on a subject's own data, and when it cannot. The prediction scheme uses a multiclass support vector machine algorithm. Predictions are demonstrated to have a close fit to recorded physiological phase, with median Pearson correlation scores between recorded and predicted values of 0.99 for the best case scenario (cardiac cycle trained on a subject's own data) down to 0.83 for the worst case scenario (respiratory predictions trained on group data), as compared to random chance correlation score of 0.70. When predictions were used with RETROICOR-a popular physiological noise removal tool-the effects are compared to using recorded phase values. Using Fourier transforms and seed based correlation analysis, RETROICOR is shown to produce similar effects whether recorded physiological phase values are used, or they are predicted using this technique. This was seen by similar levels of noise reduction noise in the same regions of the Fourier spectra, and changes in seed based correlation scores in similar regions of the brain. This technique has a use in situations where data from direct monitoring of the cardiac and respiratory cycles are incomplete or absent, but researchers still wish to reduce this source of noise in the image data.

Real-time fMRI using whole brain 4-slab EVI with 286ms temporal resolution (4mm isotropic voxel size) and partial brain 2-slab EVI with 136ms temporal resolution (4×4×6mm(3) voxel size) was performed on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI scanner equipped with 12-channel head coil. Four-slab EVI of visual and motor tasks significantly increased mean (visual: 96\%, motor: 66\%) and maximum t-score (visual: 263\%, motor: 124\%) and mean (visual: 59\%, motor: 131\%) and maximum (visual: 29\%, motor: 67\%) BOLD signal amplitude compared with EPI. Time domain moving average filtering (2s width) to suppress physiological noise from cardiac and respiratory fluctuations further improved mean (visual: 196\%, motor: 140\%) and maximum (visual: 384\%, motor: 200\%) t-scores and increased extents of activation (visual: 73\%, motor: 70\%) compared to EPI. Similar sensitivity enhancement, which is attributed to high sampling rate at only moderately reduced temporal signal-to-noise ratio (mean: -52\%) and longer sampling of the BOLD effect in the echo-time domain compared to EPI, was measured in auditory cortex. Two-slab EVI further improved temporal resolution for measuring task-related activation and enabled mapping of five major resting state networks (RSNs) in individual subjects in 5min scans. The bilateral sensorimotor, the default mode and the occipital RSNs were detectable in time frames as short as 75s. In conclusion, the high sampling rate of real-time multi-slab EVI significantly improves sensitivity for studying the temporal dynamics of hemodynamic responses and for characterizing functional networks at high field strength in short measurement times",

Each participant's data consisted of a resting state fMRI scan as well as phenotypic data (age, gender, handedness, IQ, and site of scanning) from the ADHD-200 dataset. We used machine learning techniques to produce support vector machine (SVM) classifiers that attempted to differentiate between (1) all ADHD patients vs. healthy controls and (2) ADHD combined (ADHD-c) type vs. ADHD inattentive (ADHD-i) type vs. controls. In different tests, we used only the phenotypic data, only the imaging data, or else both the phenotypic and imaging data. For feature extraction on fMRI data, we tested the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), different variants of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and combinations of FFT and PCA. PCA variants included PCA over time (PCA-t), PCA over space and time (PCA-st), and kernelized PCA (kPCA-st). Baseline chance accuracy was 64.2\% produced by guessing healthy control (the majority class) for all participants. Using only phenotypic data produced 72.9\% accuracy on two class diagnosis and 66.8\% on three class diagnosis. Diagnosis using only imaging data did not perform as well as phenotypic-only approaches. Using both phenotypic and imaging data with combined FFT and kPCA-st feature extraction yielded accuracies of 76.0\% on two class diagnosis and 68.6\% on three class diagnosis-better than phenotypic-only approaches. Our results demonstrate the potential of using FFT and kPCA-st with resting-state fMRI data as well as phenotypic data for automated diagnosis of ADHD. These results are encouraging given known challenges of learning ADHD diagnostic classifiers using the ADHD-200 dataset (see Brown et al., 2012)",

    abstract = {Impulsivity is a complex trait associated with a range of maladaptive behaviors, including many forms of psychopathology. Previous research has implicated multiple neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems in impulsive behavior, but the relationship between impulsivity and organization of whole-brain networks has not yet been explored. Using graph theory analyses, we characterized the relationship between impulsivity and the functional segregation ("modularity") of the whole-brain network architecture derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These analyses revealed remarkable differences in network organization across the impulsivity spectrum. Specifically, in highly impulsive individuals, regulatory structures including medial and lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex were isolated from subcortical structures associated with appetitive drive, whereas these brain areas clustered together within the same module in less impulsive individuals. Further exploration of the modular organization of whole-brain networks revealed novel shifts in the functional connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, cortical, and subcortical structures across the impulsivity spectrum. The current findings highlight the utility of graph theory analyses of resting-state fMRI data in furthering our understanding of the neurobiological architecture of complex behaviors},

However, these studies only assessed functional connectivity within a specific network or between a few regions of interest, while comorbidity and use of medication was not always controlled for. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity, unbiased by a priori definition of regions or networks of interest, in medication-free depressive patients without comorbidity. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data of 19 medication-free patients with a recent diagnosis of major depression (within 6 months before inclusion) and no comorbidity, and 19 age- and gender-matched controls. Independent component analysis was employed on the concatenated data sets of all participants. Thirteen functionally relevant networks were identified, describing the entire study sample. Next, individual representations of the networks were created using a dual regression method. Statistical inference was subsequently done on these spatial maps using voxel-wise permutation tests. Abnormal functional connectivity was found within three resting-state networks in depression: (1) decreased bilateral amygdala and left anterior insula connectivity in an affective network, (2) reduced connectivity of the left frontal pole in a network associated with attention and working memory, and (3) decreased bilateral lingual gyrus connectivity within ventromedial visual regions. None of these effects were associated with symptom severity or gray matter density. We found abnormal resting-state functional connectivity not previously associated with major depression, which might relate to abnormal affect regulation and mild cognitive deficits, both associated with the symptomatology of the disorder.",

Steady-state measures of interregional correlations are particularly useful because they do not depend on the specific design of a task nor on subtracting conditions in a blocked design task. However, the conditions under which such correlations are measured may influence these indices of functional connectivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of task demand on interregional correlations within the motor system. Specifically, tapping rates in audibly paced finger-tapping tasks were controlled and varied between runs in order to observe their effects on interregional correlations to contralateral primary motor cortex (PM). Regions of interest included the supplementary motor area, ipsilateral cerebellum, ipsilateral auditory cortex, and a control region. It was found that tapping rate was a significant factor in determining the mean correlation of some regions to PM, and that correlations measured during tapping in general increased relative to resting state. Furthermore, analysis of the percent of voxels in each region significantly correlated to PM suggested that changes in the mean correlation of that region to PM could be accounted for by changes in the fraction of significantly correlated voxels within a region. This provides insight into the manner in which steady-state correlations are modified in response to different task demands and further evidence that low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signals reflect functional connectivity.",

    abstract = {Brains are restless. We have long known of the existence of a great deal of uninterrupted brain activity that maintains the body in a stable state--from an evolutionary standpoint one of the brain's most ancient tasks. But intrinsic, ongoing activity is not limited to subcortical, life-maintaining structures; cortex, too, is remarkably active even in the absence of a sensory stimulus or a specific behavioral task. This is evident both in its enormous energy consumption at rest and in the large, spontaneous but coherent fluctuations of neural activity that spread across different areas. Not surprisingly, a growing number of electrophysiological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are appearing that report on various aspects of the brain's spontaneous activity or "default mode" of operation. One recent study reports results from simultaneously combined electrophysiological and fMRI measurements in the monkey visual cortex (Shmuel, A., Leopold, D.A., 2008. Neuronal correlates of spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI signals in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional connectivity at rest. Hum. Brain Mapp. 29, 751-761). The authors claim to be able to demonstrate correlations between slow fluctuations in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying, locally measured neuronal activity. They even go on to speculate that the fluctuations display wave-like spatiotemporal patterns across cortex. In the present report, however, we re-analyze the data presented in that study and demonstrate that the measurements were not actually taken during rest. Visual cortex was subject to almost imperceptible but physiologically clearly detectable flicker induced by the visual stimulator. An examination of the power spectral density of the neural responses and the neurovascular impulse response function shows that such imperceptible flicker strongly suppresses the slow oscillations and changes the degree of covariance between neural and vascular signals. In addition, a careful analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns demonstrates that no slow waves of activity exist in visual cortex; instead, the presented wave data reflect differences in signal-to-noise ratio at various cortical sites due to local differences in vascularization. In this report, assuming that the term "spontaneous activity" refers to intrinsic physiological processes at the absence of sensory inputs or motor outputs, we discuss the need for careful selection of experimental protocols and of examining the degree to which the activation of sensory areas might influence the cortical or subcortical processes in other brain regions.},

Recent findings demonstrate coherent activity in large-scale brain networks not only during task performance, but also, surprisingly, at rest in the absence of stimuli, tasks, or overt responses. Moreover, breakdown of coherent activity at rest, even in regions that are structurally intact, correlates with behavioral deficits and with their recovery after injury. This network perspective is fundamental to understand not only healthy brain function, but also the pathophysiology of brain injuries, mechanisms of functional recovery, and the basis for novel interventions for therapy. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

    abstract = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that prominently affects cerebral connectivity. Assessing the functional connectivity at rest, recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies reported on the existence of resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs are characterized by spatially coherent, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal and are made up of regional patterns commonly involved in functions such as sensory, attention, or default mode processing. In AD, the default mode network (DMN) is affected by reduced functional connectivity and atrophy. In this work, we analyzed functional and structural MRI data from healthy elderly (n = 16) and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (n = 24), a syndrome of high risk for developing AD. Two questions were addressed: (i) Are any RSNs altered in aMCI? (ii) Do changes in functional connectivity relate to possible structural changes? Independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI data identified eight spatially consistent RSNs. Only selected areas of the DMN and the executive attention network demonstrated reduced network-related activity in the patient group. Voxel-based morphometry revealed atrophy in both medial temporal lobes (MTL) of the patients. The functional connectivity between both hippocampi in the MTLs and the posterior cingulate of the DMN was present in healthy controls but absent in patients. We conclude that in individuals at risk for AD, a specific subset of RSNs is altered, likely representing effects of ongoing early neurodegeneration. We interpret our finding as a proof of principle, demonstrating that functional brain disorders can be characterized by functional-disconnectivity profiles of RSNs",

Additionally, such advances are argued to be relevant in pathological states, such as disorders of consciousness (DOC), i.e., coma, vegetative and minimally conscious states. Recent studies on resting state activity in DOC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, show that functional connectivity is disrupted in the task-negative or the default mode network. However, the two main approaches employed in the analysis of resting state functional connectivity data (i.e., hypothesis-driven seed-voxel and data-driven independent component analysis) present multiple methodological difficulties, especially in non-collaborative DOC patients. Improvements in motion artifact removal and spatial normalization are needed before fMRI resting state data can be used as proper biomarkers in severe brain injury. However, we anticipate that such developments will boost clinical resting state fMRI studies, allowing for easy and fast acquisitions and ultimately improve the diagnosis and prognosis in the absence of DOC patients' active collaboration in data acquisition.",

Here, we focus on extracting a highly, spatially reproducible statistical parametric map (SPM) from fMRI data using a cost function that does not depend on a model of the subjects' temporal response. Based on a generalized version of canonical correlation analysis (gCCA), we propose a method to extract a highly reproducible map by maximizing the sum of pair-wise correlations between some maps. In a group analysis, each map is calculated from a linear combination of fMRI scans of a subset of subjects under study. The proposed method is applied to BOLD fMRI datasets without any spatial smoothing from 10 subjects performing a simple reaction time (RT) task. Using the NPAIRS split-half resampling framework with a reproducibility measure based on SPM correlations, we compare the proposed approach with canonical variate analysis (CVA) and a simple general linear model (GLM). gCCA provides statistical parametric maps with higher reproducibility than CVA and GLM with correlation reproducibilities across independent split-half SPMs of 0.78, 0.46, and 0.41, respectively. Our results show that gCCA is an efficient approach for extracting the default mode network, assessing brain connectivity, and processing event-related and resting-state datasets in which the temporal BOLD signal varies from subject to subject",

METHODS:The resting-fMRI data of 20 TLE patients with HS and 20 normal volunteers were performed ALFF analysis. The amplitude of the blood oxygenation level-dependent activation of the resting-state brain was investigated. The brain structures showing increased and decreased ALFF in TLE patients were demonstrated by comparing to normal subjects with 2-sample t-test with threshold of P < 0.01. RESULTS:By comparison with that of normal subjects, the regions showing increased and decreased ALFF in TLE patients were distributed in the brain symmetrically and bilaterally. The regions showing increased ALFF were distributed with center of limbic system, such as parahippocampal gyri, amygdala, hypothalamus, dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and part of posterior insular lobe, as well as the neocortices such as primary sensorimotor cortices, occipital cortices, inferior temporal gyri, orbital gyri, and the subcortical structures of verbal brainstem and mesial cerebellum. The point with maximal increased ALFF (T = 6.02) located in the right precentral gyru (15, - 12.51). While the regions showing decreased ALFF covered the areas of default mode, such as posterior cingulate cortex/ precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex /ventral anterior cingulate cortex, as well as other structures such as dorsal lateral prefrontal cortices, superior temporal gyri, caudate heads, dorsal brain stem and the posterior cerebellum (3, -78, -21) with the maximal decreased ALFF (T = -4.42). CONCLUSION:The method of ALFF allows the direct observation to the epileptic activation in TLE. The increased ALFF is considered the facilitation such as the epileptic activity generation and propagation; while the ALFF decrease is considered the function inhibition in these regions, especially implies the suspension in the default mode activity.",

    abstract = "Neural oscillations in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) are increasingly viewed as an active inhibitory mechanism that gates and controls sensory information processing as a function of cognitive relevance. Extending this view, phase synchronization of alpha oscillations across distant cortical regions could regulate integration of information. Here, we investigated whether such long-range cross-region coupling in the alpha band is intrinsically and selectively linked to activity in a distinct functionally specialized brain network. If so, this would provide new insight into the functional role of alpha band phase synchrony. We adapted the phase-locking value to assess fluctuations in synchrony that occur over time in ongoing activity. Concurrent EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were recorded during resting wakefulness in 26 human subjects. Fluctuations in global synchrony in the upper alpha band correlated positively with activity in several prefrontal and parietal regions (as measured by fMRI). fMRI intrinsic connectivity analysis confirmed that these regions correspond to the well known fronto-parietal (FP) network. Spectral correlations with this network's activity confirmed that no other frequency band showed equivalent results. This selective association supports an intrinsic relation between large-scale alpha phase synchrony and cognitive functions associated with the FP network. This network has been suggested to implement phasic aspects of top-down modulation such as initiation and change in moment-to-moment control. Mechanistically, long-range upper alpha band synchrony is well suited to support these functions. Complementing our previous findings that related alpha oscillation power to neural structures serving tonic control, the current findings link alpha phase synchrony to neural structures underpinning phasic control of alertness and task requirements",

Results showed that, after administering inert treatment, subjective pain intensity ratings increased significantly more on nocebo regions compared with the control regions in which no expectancy/conditioning manipulation was performed. fMRI analysis of hyperalgesic nocebo responses to identical calibrated noxious stimuli showed signal increases in brain regions including bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, superior temporal gyrus; left frontal and parietal operculum, medial frontal gyrus, orbital prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule, and hippocampus; right claustrum/putamen, lateral prefrontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Functional connectivity analysis of spontaneous resting-state fMRI data from the same cohort of subjects showed a correlation between two seed regions (left frontal operculum and hippocampus) and pain network including bilateral insula, operculum, ACC, and left S1/M1. In conclusion, we found evidence that nocebo hyperalgesia may be predominantly produced through an affective-cognitive pain pathway (medial pain system), and the left hippocampus may play an important role in this process.},

    abstract = {We assessed the relation between hemodynamic and electrical indices of brain function by performing simultaneous functional MRI (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in awake subjects at rest with eyes closed. Spontaneous power fluctuations of electrical rhythms were determined for multiple discrete frequency bands, and associated fMRI signal modulations were mapped on a voxel-by-voxel basis. There was little positive correlation of localized brain activity with alpha power (8-12 Hz), but strong and widespread negative correlation in lateral frontal and parietal cortices that are known to support attentional processes. Power in a 17-23 Hz range of beta activity was positively correlated with activity in retrosplenial, temporo-parietal, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. This set of areas has previously been characterized by high but coupled metabolism and blood flow at rest that decrease whenever subjects engage in explicit perception or action. The distributed patterns of fMRI activity that were correlated with power in different EEG bands overlapped strongly with those of functional connectivity, i.e., intrinsic covariations of regional activity at rest. This result indicates that, during resting wakefulness, and hence the absence of a task, these areas constitute separable and dynamic functional networks, and that activity in these networks is associated with distinct EEG signatures. Taken together with studies that have explicitly characterized the response properties of these distributed cortical systems, our findings may suggest that alpha oscillations signal a neural baseline with "inattention" whereas beta rhythms index spontaneous cognitive operations during conscious rest},

    abstract = "At present, our knowledge about seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is based mainly up on clinical symptoms, epidemiology, behavioral characteristics and light therapy. Recently developed measures of resting-state functional brain activity might provide neurobiological markers of brain disorders. Studying functional brain activity in SAD could enhance our understanding of its nature and possible treatment strategies. Functional network connectivity (measured using ICA-dual regression), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were measured in 45 antidepressant-free patients (39.78 ± 10.64, 30 ♀, 15 ♂) diagnosed with SAD and compared with age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls (HCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After correcting for Type 1 error at high model orders (inter-RSN correction), SAD patients showed significantly increased functional connectivity in 11 of the 47 identified RSNs. Increased functional connectivity involved RSNs such as visual, sensorimotor, and attentional networks. Moreover, our results revealed that SAD patients compared with HCs showed significant higher ALFF in the visual and right sensorimotor cortex. Abnormally altered functional activity detected in SAD supports previously reported attentional and psychomotor symptoms in patients suffering from SAD. Further studies, particularly under task conditions, are needed in order to specifically investigate cognitive deficits in SAD. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

    abstract = "The cerebellum is a crucial structure involved in movement control and cognitive processing. Noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum results in neurophysiological and behavioral changes, an effect that has been attributed to modulation of cerebello-brain connectivity. At rest, the cerebellum exerts an overall inhibitory tone over the primary motor cortex (M1), cerebello-brain inhibition (CBI), likely through dentate-thalamo-cortical connections. The level of excitability of this pathway before and after stimulation of the cerebellum, however, has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine changes in M1, brainstem, and CBI before and after 25 min of anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right cerebellar cortex. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS would result in an enhancement of CBI and cathodal would decrease it, relative to sham stimulation. We found that cathodal tDCS resulted in a clear decrease of CBI, whereas anodal tDCS increased it, in the absence of changes after sham stimulation. These effects were specific to the cerebello-cortical connections with no changes in other M1 or brainstem excitability measures. The cathodal effect on CBI was found to be dependent on stimulation intensity and lasted up to 30 min after the cessation of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate in a focal and polarity-specific manner cerebellar excitability, likely through changes in Purkinje cell activity. Therefore, direct current stimulation of the cerebellum may have significant potential implications for patients with cerebellar dysfunction as well as to motor control studies",

The functional networks based on MRC have not been described in major depression disorder (MDD). Both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and thalamus are all the key regions of MRC. This study was to investigate the two functional networks related to ACC and thalamus in MDD.METHODS: Sixteen patients with MDD on first episode which never got any medication and sixteen matched health controls were scanned by 3.0 T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state. The pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) was used as seed region to construct the functional network by cortex section. The thalamus was used as seed region to construct the functional network by limbic section. Paired-t tests between-groups were performed for the seed-target correlations based on the individual fisher z-transformed correlation maps by SPM2.RESULTS: Depressed subjects exhibited significantly great functional connectivity (FC) between pgACC and the parahippocampus gyrus in one cluster (size 923) including left parahippocampus gyrus (-21, -49, 7), left parietal lobe (-3, -46, 52) and left frontal lobe (-27, -46, 28). The one cluster (size 962) of increased FC on thalamus network overlapped the precuneus near to right parietal lobe (9, -52, 46) and right cingulate gyrus (15, -43, 43) in health controls.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal functional networks exist in earlier manifestation of MDD related to MRC by both cortex and limbic sections. The increased functional connectivity of pgACC and decreased functional connectivity of thalamus is mainly involved in bias mood processing and cognition",

While the use of acupuncture as a complementary therapeutic method for treating MCI is popular in certain parts of the world, the underlying mechanism is still elusive. We sought to investigate the acupuncture effects on the functional connectivity throughout the entire brain in MCI patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment was performed with two different paradigms, namely, deep acupuncture (DA) and superficial acupuncture (SA), at acupoint KI3. We first identified regions showing abnormal functional connectivity in the MCI group compared to HC during the resting state and subsequently tested whether these regions could be modulated by acupuncture. Then, we made the comparison of MCI vs. HC to test whether there were any specific modulatory patterns in the poststimulus resting brain between the two groups. Finally, we made the comparisons of DA vs. SA in each group to test the effect of acupuncture with different needling depths. We found the temporal regions (hippocampus, thalamus, fusiform gyrus) showing abnormal functional connectivity during the resting state. These regions are implicated in memory encoding and retrieving. Furthermore, we found significant changes in functional connectivity related with the abnormal regions in MCI patients following acupuncture. Compared to HC, the correlations related with the temporal regions were enhanced in the poststimulus resting brain in MCI patients. Compared to SA, significantly increased correlations related with the temporal regions were found for the DA condition. The enhanced correlations in the memory-related brain regions following acupuncture may be related to the purported therapeutically beneficial effects of acupuncture for the treatment of MCI. The heterogeneous modulatory patterns between DA and SA may suggest that deep muscle insertion of acupuncture is necessary to achieve the appreciable clinical effect",

Depression and anxiety severity was assessed by the Short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) respectively. The functional discrepancy was measured by the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of resting-state functional MRI signal. Correlation analysis was carried out between ALFF values and SMFQ and SCARED scores. Resting brain activity levels measured by ALFF was higher in the frontal cortex than that in the subcortical system involving mainly (para) limbic-striatal regions in both HC and MDD adolescents. The difference of ALFF values between frontal and subcortical systems was increased in MDD adolescents as compared with the controls.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present study identified an increased imbalance of resting-state brain activity between the frontal cognitive control system and the (para) limbic-striatal emotional processing system in MDD adolescents.

Many previous neuroimaging studies have provided consistent evidence of 'dysfunctional connectivity' among the brain regions in schizophrenia; however, little is known about whether or not this dysfunctional connectivity causes disruption of the topological properties of brain functional networks. To this end, we investigated the topological properties of human brain functional networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Data was obtained from 31 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy subjects; then functional connectivity between 90 cortical and sub-cortical regions was estimated by partial correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. Our findings demonstrated that the brain functional networks had efficient small-world properties in the healthy subjects; whereas these properties were disrupted in the patients with schizophrenia. Brain functional networks have efficient small-world properties which support efficient parallel information transfer at a relatively low cost. More importantly, in patients with schizophrenia the small-world topological properties are significantly altered in many brain regions in the prefrontal, parietal and temporal lobes. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis of dysfunctional integration of the brain in this illness. Specifically, we found that these altered topological measurements correlate with illness duration in schizophrenia. Detection and estimation of these alterations could prove helpful for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism as well as for evaluation of the severity of schizophrenia.",

Despite decades of extensive research, the neuropathological mechanisms responsible for the development of this devastating condition remain largely unknown, hindering our ability to develop effective treatments. Because several lines of evidence implicate abnormalities of the thalamus and cortex in the etiology of SCI pain, we hypothesized that SCI pain results from abnormal functional connectivity of brain areas heavily implicated in pain processing. We performed a longitudinal study in a rat model of SCI (SCI group, n = 8; sham-operated group, n = 6) and acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans before spinal surgery and 3, 7, 14, and 21 (SCI only) days after surgery in the same animals. Functional connectivity was decreased between the ventroposterior lateral thalamus (VPL) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) 7 d after SCI. This reduction preceded an increase in connectivity between S1 and other cortical areas involved in nociceptive processing. In addition, VPL had increased connectivity to contralateral thalamus at 7 and 14 d after injury. The temporal pattern of the increase in functional connectivity within the thalamus and between cortical areas (particularly S1 and retrosplenial cortex) had a striking resemblance to the temporal pattern for the development of a "below-level" mechanical hypersensitivity in the same animals. Our findings suggest that below-level hypersensitivity is associated with functional disconnection (asynchrony) between the thalamus and cortical areas involved in nociceptive processing},

We assessed brain activation patterns of high and low suggestible people while resting in the fMRI scanner and while engaged in visual tasks, in and out of hypnosis. High suggestible participants in hypnosis showed decreased brain activity in the anterior parts of the default mode circuit. In low suggestible people, hypnotic induction produced no detectable changes in these regions, but instead deactivated areas involved in alertness.

    abstract = "To further understanding of basic and complex cognitive functions, previous connectome research has identified functional and structural connections of the human brain. Functional connectivity is often measured by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and is generally interpreted as an indirect measure of neuronal activity. Gray matter (GM) primarily consists of neuronal and glia cell bodies; therefore, it is surprising that the majority of connectome research has excluded GM measures. Therefore, we propose that by exploring where GM corresponds to function would aid in the understanding of both structural and functional connectivity and in turn the human connectome. A cohort of 603 healthy participants underwent structural and functional scanning on the same 3 T scanner at the Mind Research Network. To investigate the spatial correspondence between structure and function, spatial independent component analysis (ICA) was applied separately to both GM density (GMD) maps and to rs-fMRI data. ICA of GM delineates structural components based on the covariation of GMD regions among subjects. For the rs-fMRI data, ICA identified spatial patterns with common temporal features. These decomposed structural and functional components were then compared by spatial correlation. Basal ganglia components exhibited the highest structural to resting-state functional spatial correlation (r = 0.59). Cortical components generally show correspondence between a single structural component and several resting-state functional components. We also studied relationships between the weights of different structural components and identified the precuneus as a hub in GMD structural network correlations. In addition, we analyzed relationships between component weights, age, and gender; concluding that age has a significant effect on structural components",

    abstract = "The changes of spontaneous activity from before and after a memory or learning task had been considered to be related to off-line memory consolidation process in human brain by using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI (fMRI). However, RSFC reflects temporal synchronization of timecourses of spatially distinct brain regions and therefore could not determine which specific brain region is involved in the memory consolidation process. Here we used regional homogeneity (ReHo), a method for measuring local synchronization, to link the local spontaneous activity change to off-line episodic memory consolidation. We hypothesized that the spontaneous activity change would be different between people with better memory performance and those with worse performance in memory-related regions. All participants completed two resting-state sessions, that is, before (REST-1) and after (REST-2) an episodic memory encoding task (picture indoor or outdoor judgment). Then, based on the d' of a later surprise memory retrieval test, a high-performance group and a low-performance group, each consisting of 16 participants, were chosen from whole 58 participants. We defined a ReHo ratio, that is, ReHo of REST-2 divided by ReHo of REST-1, as a change induced by memory consolidation. The high-performance group showed a significant higher ReHo ratio than low-performance group in medial temporal lobe (MTL) including parahippocampal and anterior temporal regions. The current results provide neuroimaging evidence supporting that the MTL is involved in off-line memory consolidation of episodic memory. Moreover, this study may provide a paradigm for understanding of episodic memory deficit in Alzheimer's disease",

Theories of PRC and PHC function in humans have been informed by neuroanatomical studies of these regions obtained in animal tract-tracing studies, but knowledge of the connectivity of PHC and PRC in humans is limited. To address this issue, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the intrinsic functional connectivity profiles associated with the PRC and PHC both across the neocortex and within the subfields of the hippocampus. In Experiment 1, we acquired standard-resolution whole-brain resting-state fMRI data in 15 participants, and in Experiment 2, we acquired high-resolution resting-state fMRI data targeting the hippocampus in an independent sample of 15 participants. Experiment 1 revealed that PRC showed preferential connectivity with the anterior hippocampus, whereas PHC showed preferential connectivity with posterior hippocampus. Experiment 2 indicated that this anterior-posterior functional connectivity dissociation was more evident for subfields CA1 and subiculum than for a combined CA2/CA3/dentate gyrus region. Finally, whole-brain analyses from Experiment 1 revealed preferential PRC connectivity with an anterior temporal and frontal cortical network, and preferential PHC connectivity with a posterior medial temporal, parietal, and occipital network. These results suggest a framework for refining models of the functional organization of the human medial temporal lobes in which the PRC and PHC are associated with distinct neocortical pathways that, in turn, may differentially interact with regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways dysfunction is involved in pathological oscillations causing tremor in essential tremor (ET). Low-frequency (1 Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can effectively modulate the cerebellar output. OBJECTIVE: As one session of rTMS can induce a brief improvement, we hypothesized that repeated sessions might have a cumulative and potentially long-term therapeutic effect on ET. We assessed, in an open label trial, the efficacy of one-week rTMS treatment on tremor and on the motor-CTC dysfunction in ET patients. METHODS: Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity was used as an indicator of CTC network integrity in 11 ET patients and 11 healthy subjects. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was quantified at baseline in patients and control subjects between the cerebellum and the motor network, and between the cerebellum and the default brain network (DBN) taken as control. The fMRI study was repeated in patients after 5 days of bilateral 1 Hz rTMS applied to the posterior cerebellar cortex. Tremor was assessed clinically (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale) and quantified using electromyographic and accelerometric recordings at baseline (day 1, before the cerebellar stimulation) and after the end of the cerebellar stimulation period at day 5, day 12 and day 29. RESULTS: Repeated rTMS over the cerebellum significantly improved total and specific (tremor, drawing, functional disability) scores, and reduced tremor amplitude (P < 0.006). It also re-established the defective information processing in the CTC network (P($\Delta$|y) > 0.909), but not in the DBN. The effects persisted for 3 weeks after the last session. CONCLUSION: Cerebellar stimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with severe essential tremor",

Because the efficacy of interventions varies with the duration of pain, the identification of early biomarkers for chronic pain would have important public health consequences. Imaging of functional connectivity differences between brain regions might identify some of the earliest functional consequences of a disease process. We tested the hypothesis that chronic musculoskeletal pain in older persons is associated with changes in functional brain connectivity. METHOD: We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a spherical seed-based region of interest approach to assess functional connectivity of brain regions on a sample of 128 (64 who reported chronic musculoskeletal pain and 64 demographically matched, pain free) nondemented older adults from the Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathological cohort study of aging and dementia. RESULTS: Older adults with chronic pain showed greater functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and left insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and left cerebellum.

However, few studies have investigated the characteristics of the whole brain networks in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the topological properties of the whole brain networks in 18 AD patients, 16 MCI patients, and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. Among the three groups, AD patients showed the longest characteristic path lengths and the largest clustering coefficients, while the small-world measures of MCI networks exhibited intermediate values. The finding was not surprising, given that MCI is considered to be the prodromal stage of AD. Compared with normal controls, MCI patients showed decreased nodal centrality mainly in the medial temporal lobe as well as increased nodal centrality in the occipital regions. In addition, we detected increased nodal centrality in the medial temporal lobe and frontal gyrus, and decreased nodal centrality mainly in the amygdala in MCI patients compared with AD patients. The results suggested a widespread rewiring in AD and MCI patients. These findings concerning AD and MCI may be an integrated reflection of reorganization of the brain networks accompanied with the cognitive decline that may lead to AD",

RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, patients with MDD showed significantly decreased fALFF in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left parahippocampal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus and increased fALFF in left superior occipital gyrus/cuneus (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Further receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analyses suggested that the alterations of fALFF in these regions might be used as markers to classify patients with MDD from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated LFOs abnormalities in MDD and the fALFF analysis might be a potential approach in further exploration of this disorder",

This finding may be of particular relevance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth, confounding analyses to the extent that motion and subject age are related. Furthermore, while Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents (n = 456). Following replication of the effect of motion on seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with increased within-network connectivity even when motion was accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

Functional connectivity, spectral information, and spatiotemporal dynamics were compared for the BOLD and CBV-weighted resting state scans.RESULTS: BOLD scans exhibited higher cross-correlation values compared to CBV-weighted scans, but the spatial patterns of correlation were similar. The BOLD spectrum contains power evenly distributed throughout the low-frequency range while the CBV power spectrum exhibited a high power peak localized to approximately 0.2 Hz. Both BOLD and CBV resting state scans showed similar propagating waves of activity along the cortex from the SII toward MI; however, these waves were detected more often in BOLD scans than in CBV scans.CONCLUSION: While the power spectrum of the CBV signal is different from that of the BOLD signal, both connectivity maps and spatiotemporal dynamics are similar for the two modalities. Further experiments should address the relationship between spontaneous neural activity, local changes in metabolism, and hemodynamic fluctuations to elucidate the origins of the BOLD and CBV signals.",

    abstract = "Whether glucocorticoids mediate medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulation of the amygdala in humans remains unclear. In the current study we investigated whether cortisol levels under relatively stress-free circumstances are related to amygdala resting-state functional connectivity with the mPFC. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 20 healthy male participants. Salivary cortisol was sampled at multiple times throughout the experiment. The cortisol area under the curve increase (AUCi) was calculated as a measure of cortisol dynamics. Next, seed based correlations were employed on the resting-state fMRI data to reveal regions of amygdala functional connectivity related to variations in cortisol AUCi. The resulting statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster based thresholding (Z>2.3, p<.05). Two regions in the mPFC showed decreasing negative functional connectivity with the amygdala when a lesser decrease in cortisol AUCi was observed: the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal pole (BA10). Although we initially showed a relation with cortisol AUCi, it seemed that the baseline cortisol levels were actually driving this effect: higher baseline cortisol levels related to stronger negative functional connectivity with the mPFC. Endogenous cortisol levels may modulate amygdala functional connectivity with specific regions in the mPFC, even under relatively stress-free circumstances. Our results corroborate previous findings from both animal and human studies, suggesting cortisol-mediated regulation of the amygdala by the mPFC. We propose that through this feedback mechanism the stress response might be adjusted, pointing to the putative role of cortisol in modulating stress- and, more generally, emotional responses",

    abstract = "Recent studies have demonstrated large amplitude spontaneous fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks. Despite the large body of human imaging literature on spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in the underlying neuronal signals",

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The "default network" consists of a number of brain regions that exhibit correlated low-frequency activity at rest and that have been suggested to be involved in the processing of self-relevant stimuli. Activity in many of these areas has also been shown to be altered in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, part of the default network, would exhibit altered connectivity at rest with other areas of the default network and regions associated with PTSD.METHODS: Seventeen medicated and unmedicated female patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to early-life trauma and 15 healthy female controls underwent a 5.5-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging scan with their eyes closed. We assessed areas of the brain whose activity positively and negatively correlated with that of the PCC/precuneus in both groups.RESULTS: At rest, spontaneous low-frequency activity in the PCC/precuneus was more strongly correlated with activity in other areas of the default network in healthy controls than in patients with PTSD. Direct comparison of the 2 groups showed that PCC/ precuneus connectivity was also greater in healthy controls than in patients with PTSD in a number of areas previously associated with PTSD, including the right amygdala and the hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus.LIMITATIONS: Because our PTSD sample comprised only women with chronic early-life trauma exposure, our results may not be generalizeable to male patients, to a population with single trauma exposure or to those who were adults when the trauma occurred. In addition, our sample included patients taking medication and it is not yet clear how altered connectivity is affected by medication.CONCLUSION: Spontaneous activity in the default network during rest, as measured using PCC correlations, is altered in patients with PTSD. The potential effects of psychotropic medications on default network connectivity in the present sample remain unknown. In this patient population, the observed alterations may be associated with the disturbances in self-referential processing often observed in patients with chronic PTSD related to early-life trauma},

    abstract = "Recent resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown significant group differences in several regions and networks between patients with major depressive disorder and healthy controls. The objective of the present study was to investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of identifying major depressive individuals from healthy controls. Multivariate pattern analysis was employed to classify 24 depressed patients from 29 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to assess classifier performance. The experimental results demonstrate that 94.3\% (P < 0.0001) of subjects were correctly classified by leave-one-out cross-validation, including 100\% identification of all patients. The majority of the most discriminating functional connections were located within or across the default mode network, affective network, visual cortical areas and cerebellum, thereby indicating that the disease-related resting-state network alterations may give rise to a portion of the complex of emotional and cognitive disturbances in major depression. Moreover, the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, which exhibit high discriminative power in classification, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of this disorder. The current study may shed new light on the pathological mechanism of major depression and suggests that whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging may provide potential effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis",

We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 50 young adults during an initial resting state, followed by an N-back working memory task and a subsequent resting state, in order to examine changes in functional connectivity within and between the default-mode network (DMN) and the task-positive network (TPN) across the three states. We found that alterations in connectivity observed during the N-back task persisted into the subsequent resting state within the TPN and between the DMN and TPN, but not within the DMN. Further, both speed of working memory performance and TPN connectivity strength during the N-back task predicted connectivity strength in the subsequent resting state. Finally, DMN connectivity measured before and during the N-back task predicted individual differences in self-reported inattentiveness, but this association was not found during the post-task resting state. Together, these findings have important implications for models of how the brain recovers following effortful cognition, as well as for experimental designs using resting and task scans.

PET imaging, and recently, the MRI technique of continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) have shown evidence of changes in metabolic patterns in individuals with PD. The purpose of this study was to learn if the presence of PD could be "predicted" based on resting fluctuations of the BOLD signal. Participants were 15 healthy controls, 14 subjects with PD, and 1 subject who presented as a control but later developed PD. The amplitude of the low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was used as an index of brain activity level in the resting state. Participants with PD using this index showed a reliable decrease in activity in a number of regions, including the supplementary motor cortex, the mesial prefrontal cortex, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left cerebellum (lobule VII/VIII) as well as increased activity in the right cerebellum (lobule IV/V). Using a cross validation approach we term "Reliability Mapping of Regional Differences" (RMRD) to analyze our sample, we were able to reliably distinguish participants with PD from controls with 92\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity. Our "pre-diagnostic" subject segregated in our analysis with the PD group. These results suggest that resting fMRI should be considered for development as a biomarker and analytical tool for evaluation of PD.},

Despite significant progresses made in characterizing the white matter's structural properties using post-mortem techniques and in vivo diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) methods, its physiology remains poorly understood. In the present study, cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the white matter was investigated on a fiber tract-specific basis using MRI (n=10, 25-33 years old). It was found that CBF in the white matter varied considerably, up to a factor of two between fiber groups. Furthermore, a paradoxically inverse correlation was observed between white matter CBF and structural and functional connectivities (P<0.001). Fiber tracts that had a higher CBF tended to have a lower fractional anisotropy in water diffusion, and the gray matter terminals connected to the tract also tended to have a lower temporal synchrony in resting-state BOLD signal fluctuation. These findings suggest a clear association between white matter perfusion and gray matter activity, but the nature of this relationship requires further investigations given that they are negatively, rather than positively, correlated.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of sensorimotor brain activity, as assessed by task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), on functional connectivity indices in the same region. Regions of activation for sequential finger motion were determined using a task-based, block-design fMRI study. Functional connectivity measurements based on interregional correlations were acquired at rest and during continuous, sequential finger motion. Connectivity indices were determined using normalized mean correlations within and between three regions of interest activated for the finger motion task. Connectivity indices were also determined for a control region that was not activated for the task. Continuous motor tasks performed during BOLD measurements did not significantly affect the functional connectivity as compared to the connectivity at rest within or between regions known to be activated by the task. However, there appeared to be a trend suggesting a slight reduction in connectivity indices during the motor task. The connectivity within and between those areas not activated for the task remained unchanged between conditions. These results suggest that in the motor system investigated, the recruitment of neurons to perform a specific task may moderately reduce the degree of hemodynamic coupling within and between regions",

A seed-region analysis revealed consistent ipsilateral functional connections of the FEF with fronto-parietal cortical areas across both species. These included the intraparietal sulcus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and supplementary eye fields. The analysis also revealed greater lateralization of connectivity with the FEF in both hemispheres in humans than in monkeys. Cortical surface-based transformation of connectivity maps between species further corroborated the remarkable similar organization of the FEF functional connectivity.

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To explore the pathological mechanism of brain function and structure in young patients with major depressive disorder by diffusion tensor imaging(DTI)and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Sixteen participants diagnosed with major depression (MD) and 16 healthy age and gender-matched controls(HC) were recruited. Resting state fMRI and DTI brain scans were performed on all participants. A voxel-based method (VBM) was used to analyze the DTI datasets, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was applied to preprocess the fMRI datasets. The value of fractional anisotropy (FA) and ReHo maps were obtained in the whole brain. RESULTS: FA values in the MD group were significantly lower than those of the healthy controls in the white matter of the left middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, right precentral gyrus, left angular gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, right sub-gyral, left insula, and left pyramis (P<0.01). ReHo in the MD group decreased in the left superior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, left paracentral lobule, right paracentral lobule, right inferior parietal lobule, left postcentral gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left lingual gyrus, right putamen, right cingulate gyrus, right cuneus, left superior temporal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Abnormality of brain white microstructure and function exist widely in young patients with major depressive disorder. Abnormal connection of structures and function between the brain areas may be the key reason for the depression.",

    abstract = {Background: Several functional neuroimaging studies have reported regionally abnormal activation of the frontal cortex in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) during cognitive and affective task performance. However, little is known about neural function in individuals with BPD during the resting state. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the functional connectivity of prefrontal and limbic networks in patients with BPD. Methods: Between January 2009 and March 2010, we investigated patients with BPD according to DSM-IV criteria and healthy controls by means of resting-state fMRI. The data were analyzed using a spatial group independent component analysis, and random effects t tests were used to compare spatial components between groups (p < 0.005, uncorrected). Results: There were 17 women with BPD and 17 female healthy controls enrolled in this study. Within a network comprising cortical midline regions ("default mode network"), patients with BPD showed an increase in functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex (FPC) and the left insula, whereas decreased connectivity was found in the left cuneus. Within a network comprising predominantly right lateral prefrontal and bilateral parietal regions, patients with BPD showed decreased connectivity of the left inferior parietal lobule and the right middle temporal cortex compared with healthy controls. Two networks comprising lateral prefrontal and cingulate regions did not exhibit significant between-group differences. We found correlations between functional connectivity of the FPC and measures of impulsivity as well as between connectivity of the insula/cuneus and dissociation tension. Limitations: Co-occurrent axis I disorders and medication use in this sample of patients with BPD have to be considered as potential limitations. Conclusion: These data suggest that abnormal functional connectivity of temporally coherent resting-state networks may underlie certain symptom clusters in patients with BPD.},

    abstract = "The default-mode network, a coherent resting-state brain network, is thought to characterize basal neural activity. Aberrant default-mode connectivity has been reported in a host of neurological and psychiatric illnesses and in persons at genetic risk for such illnesses. Whereas the neurophysiologic mechanisms that regulate default-mode connectivity are unclear, there is growing evidence that genetic factors play a role. In this report, we estimate the importance of genetic effects on the default-mode network by examining covariation patterns in functional connectivity among 333 individuals from 29 randomly selected extended pedigrees. Heritability for default-mode functional connectivity was 0.424 +/- 0.17 (P = 0.0046). Although neuroanatomic variation in this network was also heritable, the genetic factors that influence default-mode functional connectivity and gray-matter density seem to be distinct, suggesting that unique genes influence the structure and function of the network. In contrast, significant genetic correlations between regions within the network provide evidence that the same genetic factors contribute to variation in functional connectivity throughout the default mode. Specifically, the left parahippocampal region was genetically correlated with all other network regions. In addition, the posterior cingulate/precuneus region, medial prefrontal cortex, and right cerebellum seem to form a subnetwork. Default-mode functional connectivity is influenced by genetic factors that cannot be attributed to anatomic variation or a single region within the network. By establishing the heritability of default-mode functional connectivity, this experiment provides the obligatory evidence required before these measures can be considered as endophenotypes for psychiatric or neurological illnesses or to identify genes influencing intrinsic brain function.",

Repeat resting blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were acquired from 32 healthy subjects. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the stability of the four metrics.RESULTS: Random noise yielded small random SRFC, small but consistent ReHo and ALFF. A neighborhood size greater than 20 voxels should be used for calculating ReHo in order to reduce the noise interference. Both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-based SRFC were reproducible in more spatially extended regions than ICA NTFC. The two regional spontaneous brain activity (SBA) measures, ReHo and ALFF, showed test-retest reproducibility in almost the whole gray matter.CONCLUSION: SRFC, ReHo, and ALFF are robust to random noise interference. The neighborhood size for calculating ReHo should be larger than 20 voxels. ICC > 0.5 and cluster size > 11 should be used to assess the ICC maps for ACC/PCC SRFC, ReHo, and ALFF. BOLD fMRI-based SBA can be reliably measured using ACC/PCC SRFC, ReHo, and ALFF after 2 months",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Previous structural data obtained with diffusion tensor imaging axonal tracking have demonstrated possible in vivo connections between the human red nucleus (RN) and the sensorimotor and associative cortical areas. However, tractographic reconstructions can include false trajectories because of, for instance, the low spatial resolution of diffusion images or the inability to precisely detect fiber crossings. The rubral network was therefore reassessed by functional connectivity during the brain resting state. Because the RN is located very close to the substantia nigra (SN), the nigral network was also studied to ensure that these 2 circuits were correctly dissociated. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Data from 14 right-handed healthy volunteers were acquired at rest and analyzed by region-of-interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity fluctuations of separate ROIs located in the RN and SN were successively used to identify significant temporal correlations with BOLD signal intensity fluctuations of other brain regions. RESULTS:Low-frequency BOLD signal intensity of the RN correlated with signal intensity fluctuations in the cerebellum; mesencephalon; SN; hypothalamus; pallidum; thalamus; insula; claustrum; posterior hippocampus; precuneus; and occipital, prefrontal, and fronto-opercular cortices. Despite some cortical and subcortical overlaps with nigral connectivity, this rubral network was clearly distinct from the nigral network, which showed a strong correlation with the striatum; cerebellar vermis; and more widespread frontal, prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortical areas. CONCLUSIONS:During the brain resting state, the human RN participates in cognitive circuits related to salience and executive control, and that may partly represent a subclass of its structural connectivity as revealed by tractography.",

    abstract = {The human brain is a topologically complex network embedded in anatomical space. Here, we systematically explored relationships between functional connectivity, complex network topology, and anatomical (Euclidean) distance between connected brain regions, in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging brain networks of 20 healthy volunteers and 19 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). Normal between-subject differences in average distance of connected edges in brain graphs were strongly associated with variation in topological properties of functional networks. In addition, a club or subset of connector hubs was identified, in lateral temporal, parietal, dorsal prefrontal, and medial prefrontal/cingulate cortical regions. In COS, there was reduced strength of functional connectivity over short distances especially, and therefore, global mean connection distance of thresholded graphs was significantly greater than normal. As predicted from relationships between spatial and topological properties of normal networks, this disorder-related proportional increase in connection distance was associated with reduced clustering and modularity and increased global efficiency of COS networks. Between-group differences in connection distance were localized specifically to connector hubs of multimodal association cortex. In relation to the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis of schizophrenia, we argue that the data are consistent with the interpretation that spatial and topological disturbances of functional network organization could arise from excessive "pruning" of short-distance functional connections in schizophrenia},

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has been associated with disturbances in brain connectivity; however the exact nature of these disturbances is not fully understood. Measuring temporal correlations between the functional MRI time courses of spatially disparate brain regions obtained during rest has recently emerged as a popular paradigm for estimating brain connectivity. Previous resting state studies in schizophrenia explored connections related to particular clinical or cognitive symptoms (connectivity within a-priori selected networks), or connections restricted to functional networks obtained from resting state analysis. Relatively little has been done to understand global brain connectivity in schizophrenia. METHODS: Eighteen patients with chronic schizophrenia and 18 healthy volunteers underwent a resting state fMRI scan on a 3T magnet. Whole brain temporal correlations have been estimated using resting-state fMRI data and free surfer cortical parcellations. A multivariate classification method was then used to indentify brain connections that distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. RESULTS: The classification procedure achieved a prediction accuracy of 75\% in differentiating between groups on the basis of their functional connectivity. Relative to controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited co-existing patterns of increased connectivity between parietal and frontal regions, and decreased connectivity between parietal and temporal regions, and between the temporal cortices bilaterally. The decreased parieto-temporal connectivity was associated with the severity of patients' positive symptoms, while increased fronto-parietal connectivity was associated with patients' negative and general symptoms. DISCUSSION: Our analysis revealed two co-existing patterns of functional connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia, each related to different clinical profiles. Such results provide further evidence that abnormalities in brain connectivity, characteristic of schizophrenia, are directly related to the clinical features of the disorder",

    abstract = "Functional connectivity (FC) analyses of resting-state fMRI data allow for the mapping of large-scale functional networks, and provide a novel means of examining the impact of dopaminergic challenge. Here, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we examined the effect of L-dopa, a dopamine precursor, on striatal resting-state FC in 19 healthy young adults. We examined the FC of 6 striatal regions of interest (ROIs) previously shown to elicit networks known to be associated with motivational, cognitive and motor subdivisions of the caudate and putamen (Di Martino et al., 2008). In addition to replicating the previously demonstrated patterns of striatal FC, we observed robust effects of L-dopa. Specifically, L-dopa increased FC in motor pathways connecting the putamen ROIs with the cerebellum and brainstem. Although L-dopa also increased FC between the inferior ventral striatum and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, it disrupted ventral striatal and dorsal caudate FC with the default mode network. These alterations in FC are consistent with studies that have demonstrated dopaminergic modulation of cognitive and motor striatal networks in healthy participants. Recent studies have demonstrated altered resting state FC in several conditions believed to be characterized by abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Our findings suggest that the application of similar experimental pharmacological manipulations in such populations may further our understanding of the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in those conditions",

    abstract = "The neural mechanism of unconsciousness has been a major unsolved question in neuroscience despite its vital role in brain states like coma and anesthesia. The existing literature suggests that neural connections, information integration, and conscious states are closely related. Indeed, alterations in several important neural circuitries and networks during unconscious conditions have been reported. However, how the whole-brain network is topologically reorganized to support different patterns of information transfer during unconscious states remains unknown. Here we directly compared whole-brain neural networks in awake and anesthetized states in rodents. Consistent with our previous report, the awake rat brain was organized in a nontrivial manner and conserved fundamental topological properties in a way similar to the human brain. Strikingly, these topological features were well maintained in the anesthetized brain. Local neural networks in the anesthetized brain were reorganized with altered local network properties. The connectional strength between brain regions was also considerably different between the awake and anesthetized conditions. Interestingly, we found that long-distance connections were not preferentially reduced in the anesthetized condition, arguing against the hypothesis that loss of long-distance connections is characteristic to unconsciousness. These findings collectively show that the integrity of the whole-brain network can be conserved between widely dissimilar physiologic states while local neural networks can flexibly adapt to new conditions. They also illustrate that the governing principles of intrinsic brain organization might represent fundamental characteristics of the healthy brain. With the unique spatial and temporal scales of resting-state fMRI, this study has opened a new avenue for understanding the neural mechanism of (un)consciousness",

The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) may have a crucial role in the psychophysiology of both these disorders. In this study, we examined the functional connectivity between MPFC and other brain regions in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 14 patients with bipolar disorder, 16 patients with schizophrenia, and 15 healthy control subjects. Functional connectivity maps from the MPFC were computed for each subject and compared across the three groups. The three groups showed distinctive patterns of functional connectivity between MPFC and anterior insula, and between MPFC and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The bipolar disorder group exhibited positive correlations between MPFC and insula, and between MPFC and VLPFC, whereas the control group exhibited anticorrelations between these regions. The schizophrenia group did not exhibit any resting-state correlation or anticorrelation between the MPFC and the VLPFC or insula. In contrast, neither patient group exhibited the significant anticorrelation between dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and MPFC that was exhibited by the control group. The decoupling of DLPFC with MPFC in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia is consistent with the impaired executive functioning seen in these disorders. Functional connectivity between MPFC and insula/VLPFC distinguished bipolar disorder from schizophrenia, and may reflect differences in the affective disturbances typical of each illness.",

Twelve drug-naive SAD patients and pair-wise matched healthy controls, all drawn from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety sample, underwent resting-state fMRI. Group differences were assessed with voxel-wise gray matter density as nuisance regressor. All results were cluster corrected for multiple comparisons (Z>2.3, p<.05). Relative to control subjects, drug-naive SAD patients demonstrated increased negative right amygdala connectivity with the left middle temporal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus and left lateral occipital cortex. In the salience network patients showed increased positive bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate connectivity with the left precuneus and left lateral occipital cortex. Default mode network connectivity was not different between groups.

We used an extensive neuropsychological test battery to investigate attention and vigilance, executive functions, episodic memory and motor domains. For brain imaging, we used the optimized voxel-based morphometry procedure for the MRI data, resting-state (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-Glucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET) with correction for partial volume effects (PVEs) and voxel-based analyses. In terms of neurobehavioral performance, our patients displayed objective daytime somnolence but little impairment in memory and motor domains. Cerebral data revealed gray matter loss in the frontal and temporo-parieto-occipital cortices, the thalamus, hippocampal region, some basal ganglia and cerebellar regions, mainly in the right hemisphere. The decrease in brain metabolism was also right-lateralized, but more restricted than the gray matter density changes, and involved the precuneus, the middle and posterior cingulate gyrus, and the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as the prefrontal cortex. To conclude, despite the presence of only minor memory and motor impairments, our patients displayed significant cerebral changes in terms of both gray matter density and metabolic levels, and may have benefited from cognitive reserve and compensatory mechanisms. Thus, cerebral changes in OSA patients may precede the onset of notable neuropsychological consequences.",

However, the nature of these disturbances and the anatomical location of the regions involved are still unclear. Here, we describe a method to estimate maps of net levels of connectivity in the resting brain, and we apply it to look for differential patterns of connectivity in schizophrenia. This method uses partial coherences as a basic measure of covariability, and it minimises the effect of major physiological noise. When overall (net) connectivity maps of a sample of 40 patients with schizophrenia were compared with the maps from a matched sample of 40 controls, a single area of abnormality was found. It is an area of patient hyper-connectivity and is located frontally, in medial and orbital structures, clearly overlapping the anterior node of the default mode network (DMN). When this area is used as a region of interest in a second-level analysis, it shows functional hyper-connections with several cortical and subcortical structures. Interestingly, the most significant abnormality is found with the caudate, which has a bilateral pattern of abnormality, pointing to a possible DMN-striatum deviant relation in schizophrenia. However, hyper-connectivity observed with other regions (right hippocampus and amygdala, and other cortical structures) suggests a more pervasive alteration of brain connectivity in this disease",

Current models of basal ganglia circuitry can only partially explain the cardinal symptoms in PD. We used functional MRI to investigate the causal connectivity of basal ganglia networks from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in PD in the movement and resting state. In controls, SNc activity predicted increased activity in the supplementary motor area, the default mode network, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but, in patients, activity predicted decreases in the same structures. The SNc had decreased connectivity with the striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, default mode network, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and pons in patients compared to controls. Levodopa administration partially normalized the pattern of connectivity. Our findings show how the dopaminergic system exerts influences on widespread brain networks, including motor and cognitive networks. The pattern of basal ganglia network connectivity is abnormal in PD secondary to dopamine depletion, and is more deviant in more severe disease.

Because disease progression is rapid, high-functioning patients were recruited to assess neural changes in the relatively early stages of ALS. Twenty patients with limb-onset ALS participated in this study. A parceling technique was employed to segment both precentral gyri into multiple regions of interest (ROI), thus increasing sensitivity to detect changes that exist along discretely localized regions of the motor cortex. We report an overall systemic decrease in functional connectivity between right and left motor cortices in patients with limb-onset ALS. Additionally, we observed a pronounced disconnection between dorsal ROI pairs in the ALS group compared to the healthy control group. Furthermore, measures of limb functioning correlated with the connectivity data from dorsal ROI pairs in the ALS group, suggesting a symptomatic relationship with interhemispheric M1 connectivity",

Compared with age- and gender-matched subjects with normal vision, the anisometropic amblyopia subjects showed decreased ReHo of spontaneous brain activity in the right precuneus, the left medial prefrontal cortex, the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the left cerebellum, and increased ReHo of spontaneous brain activity was found in the bilateral conjunction area of the postcentral and precentral gyri, the left paracentral lobule, the left superior temporal gyrus, the left fusiform gyrus, the conjunction area of the right insula, putamen and the right middle occipital gyrus.

Differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 18 preHD and 18 controls were assessed with a novel MRI method based on perfusion images obtained with continuous arterial spin labeling. High-resolution structural data were collected to test for changes of brain volume. Compared with controls, preHD individuals showed decreased rCBF in medial and lateral prefrontal regions and increased rCBF in the precuneus. PreHD near to symptom onset additionally showed decreased rCBF in the putamen and increased rCBF in the hippocampus. Network analyses revealed an abnormal lateral prefrontal pattern in preHD far and near to motor onset. These data suggest early changes of frontostriatal baseline perfusion in preHD independent of substantial reductions of gray matter volume. This study also shows the feasibility of detecting neural changes in preHD with a robust MRI technique that would be suitable for longitudinal multisite application.",

In humans, functional neuroimaging studies implicate the anterior insula and pre/subgenual ACC in emotional processes, the mid-posterior insula with awareness and interoception, and the MCC with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that distinct resting state functional connectivity could be identified between (1) the anterior insula and pACC/aMCC; and (2) the entire insula (anterior, middle, and posterior insula) and the pMCC. Functional connectivity was assessed from resting state fMRI scans in 19 healthy volunteers using seed regions of interest in the anterior, middle, and posterior insula. Highly correlated, low-frequency oscillations (< 0.05 Hz) were identified between specific insula and cingulate subdivisions. The anterior insula was shown to be functionally connected with the pACC/aMCC and the pMCC, while the mid/posterior insula was only connected with the pMCC. These data provide evidence for a resting state anterior insula-pACC/aMCC cingulate system that may integrate interoceptive information with emotional salience to form a subjective representation of the body; and another system that includes the entire insula and MCC, likely involved in environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND:The capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure structural and functional connectivity in the human brain have motivated growing interest in characterizing the relationship between these measures in the distributed neural networks of the brain. In this study, we attempted an integration of structural and functional analyses of the human language circuits, including Wernicke's (WA), Broca's (BA) and supplementary motor area (SMA), using a combination of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and diffusion tensor MRI. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Functional connectivity was measured by low frequency inter-regional correlations of BOLD MRI signals acquired in a resting steady-state, and structural connectivity was measured by using adaptive fiber tracking with diffusion tensor MRI data. The results showed that different language pathways exhibited different structural and functional connectivity, indicating varying levels of inter-dependence in processing across regions. Along the path between BA and SMA, the fibers tracked generally formed a single bundle and the mean radius of the bundle was positively correlated with functional connectivity. However, fractional anisotropy was found not to be correlated with functional connectivity along paths connecting either BA and SMA or BA and WA. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These findings suggest that structure-function relations in the human language circuits may involve a number of confounding factors that need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the insights gained from this work offers a useful guidance for continued studies that may provide a non-invasive means to evaluate brain network integrity in vivo for use in diagnosing and determining disease progression and recovery.",

METHODS: Thirty normal-sighted RRMS patients, 16 without (nON-MS) and 14 with (ON-MS) previous ON, and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent a neuro-ophthalmologic evaluation, including automated perimetry and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurement, as well as an MRI protocol, including structural and resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) sequences. Functional connectivity of the V-RSN was evaluated by independent component analysis (ICA). Regional gray matter atrophy was assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A correlation analysis was performed between RS-fMRI results and clinical, neuro-ophthalmologic, and structural MRI variables. RESULTS: Compared to HCs, patients with RRMS showed a reduced functional connectivity in the peristriate visual cortex, bilaterally. Compared to nON-MS, ON-MS patients revealed a region of stronger functional connectivity in the extrastriate cortex, at the level of right lateral middle occipital gyrus, as well as a region of reduced functional connectivity at the level of right inferior peristriate cortex. These latter changes correlated with the number of previous ON. All detected V-RSN changes did not colocalize with regional gray matter atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Normal-sighted RRMS patients show a significant functional disconnection in the V-RSN. RRMS patients recovered from a previous ON show a complex reorganization of the V-RSN, including an increased functional connectivity at the level of extrastriate visual areas",

According to the neurophysiological property of the fetal brain to generate spontaneous activity, we aimed to determine the feasibility of investigating the maturation of intrinsic networks, beginning at gestational week 20 in healthy human fetuses by combining resting-state fMRI and an analytical approach, independent component analysis (ICA). In this study, functional images of 16 fetuses with morphologically normal brain development, from 20 to 36 gestational weeks of age, were acquired on a 1.5T unit (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) using single-shot, gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging. After preprocessing (motion correction, brain extraction), images were analyzed using single-subject ICA. We visualized a bilateral occipital network and medial and lateral prefrontal activity pattern that involved the future Brodmann areas 9-11. Furthermore, there was one either predominantly right (3/7 cases) or left (4/7 cases) hemispheric lateralized network that involved the superior temporal cortical regions (Brodmann areas 22 and 39). Frequency oscillations were in the range of 0.01-0.06Hz for all networks. This study shows that resting-state networks (RSNs) are shaped and are detectable in utero. Further investigations of resting-state measurements in the fetus may therefore allow developmental brain activity monitoring and may provide insights into early brain function",

Two states were compared with subjects at rest: anesthesia and no-anesthesia. Regions of both significantly increased and decreased resting-state rCBF were observed. Increases were limited primarily to subcortical structures and insula, whereas, decreases were observed primarily in neocortical regions. No significant change was found in global CBF (gCBF). By simultaneously measuring rCBF and BOLD, region-specific anesthetic effects on the coupling between rCBF and BOLD were identified. Multiple comparisons of the agent-induced rCBF and BOLD changes demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) spatial variability in rCBF-BOLD coupling. The slope of the linear regression line for AC, where rCBF was increased by sevoflurane, was markedly smaller than the slope for those ROIs where rCBF was decreased by sevoflurane, indicating a bigger change in BOLD per unit change in rCBF in regions where rCBF was increased by sevoflurane. These results suggest that it would be inaccurate to use a global quantitative model to describe coupling across all brain regions and in all anesthesia conditions. The observed spatial nonuniformity of rCBF and BOLD signal changes suggests that any interpretation of BOLD fMRI data in the presence of an anesthetic requires consideration of these insights.",

Dysmetabolism of the brain, related to elevated ammonia levels, interferes with intercortical connectivity and cognitive function. For evaluation of network efficiency, a 'small-world' network model can quantify the effectiveness of information transfer within brain networks. This study aimed to use small-world topology to investigate abnormalities of neuronal connectivity among widely distributed brain regions in patients with liver cirrhosis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Seventeen cirrhotic patients without HE, 9 with minimal HE, 9 with overt HE, and 35 healthy controls were compared. The interregional correlation matrix was obtained by averaging the rs-fMRI time series over all voxels in each of the 90 regions using the automated anatomical labeling model. Cost and correlation threshold values were then applied to construct the functional brain network. The absolute and relative network efficiencies were calculated; quantifying distinct aspects of the local and global topological network organization. Correlations between network topology parameters, ammonia levels, and the severity of HE were determined using linear regression and ANOVA. The local and global topological efficiencies of the functional connectivity network were significantly disrupted in HE patients; showing abnormal small-world properties. Alterations in regional characteristics, including nodal efficiency and nodal strength, occurred predominantly in the association, primary, and limbic/paralimbic regions. The degree of network organization disruption depended on the severity of HE. Ammonia levels were also significantly associated with the alterations in local network properties. Results indicated that alterations in the rs-fMRI network topology of the brain were associated with HE grade; and that focal or diffuse lesions disturbed the functional network to further alter the global topology and efficiency of the whole brain network. These findings provide insights into the functional changes in the human brain in HE",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cognitive performance depends on intact cortical connectivity. Important for memory processing in the human brain is the connection between posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, directly as well as indirectly via the parahippocampal gyrus. These brain areas are involved early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). At the same time, they belong to the default mode network (DMN), a functional network showing high functional connectivity under resting state conditions. In AD, this connectivity in specifically compromised, offering the possibility to investigate the structural basis of functional brain connectivity. METHODS: We studied 18 patients with mild to moderate AD, 16 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy control subjects using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI at 3.0 Tesla. We determined the effect of structural integrity in the posterior cingulate as assessed by DTI on the functional connectivity between posterior cingulate, hippocampus and parahippocampus during resting state in these three groups. RESULTS: Structural integrity was reduced in posterior cingulate fibre tracts in patients with AD in the left hemisphere; however, this effect was partly accounted for by age differences. All three groups showed high functional connectivity between posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus, via both the direct and the indirect pathways. Determination of effective connectivity yielded a negative fractional anisotropy (FA)-moderated correlation on the direct pathway in AD and MCI for both hemispheres, and in healthy controls for the right hemisphere. The indirect pathway showed a negative FA-moderated correlation in AD for the right hemisphere and in MCI for both hemispheres. Healthy controls showed a positive correlation on the indirect pathway for the left hemisphere. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that under healthy conditions, effective connectivity in the DMN between posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus is mainly maintained by the indirect pathway via the parahippocampal gyrus. Patients with AD and patients with MCI show changes in this connectivity with a partial allocation to the direct pathway, most likely reflecting early parahippocampal lesions. The combination of DTI and fMRI broadens our understanding of human brain connectivity and its pathological changes with AD.",

    abstract = "Neuroimaging community usually employs spatial smoothing to denoise magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, e.g., Gaussian smoothing kernels. Such an isotropic diffusion (ISD) based smoothing is widely adopted for denoising purpose due to its easy implementation and efficient computation. Beyond these advantages, Gaussian smoothing kernels tend to blur the edges, curvature and texture of images. Researchers have proposed anisotropic diffusion (ASD) and non-local diffusion (NLD) kernels. We recently demonstrated the effect of these new filtering paradigms on preprocessing real degraded MRI images from three individual subjects. Here, to further systematically investigate the effects at a group level, we collected both structural and functional MRI data from 23 participants. We first evaluated the three smoothing strategies' impact on brain extraction, segmentation and registration. Finally, we investigated how they affect subsequent mapping of default network based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) data. Our findings suggest that NLD-based spatial smoothing maybe more effective and reliable at improving the quality of both MRI data preprocessing and default network mapping. We thus recommend NLD may become a promising method of smoothing structural MRI images of R-fMRI pipeline. © 2011 Zuo, Xing.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of these low-frequency respiration variations on both task activation fMRI studies and resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Unlike MR signal changes correlated with the breathing motion ( approximately 0.3 Hz), BOLD signal changes correlated with across-breath variations in respiratory volume ( approximately 0.03 Hz) appear localized to blood vessels and regions with high blood volume, such as gray matter, similar to changes seen in response to a breath-hold challenge. In addition, the respiration-variation-induced signal changes were found to coincide with many of the areas identified as part of the 'default mode' network, a set of brain regions hypothesized to be more active at rest. Regions could therefore be classified as being part of a resting network based on their similar respiration-induced changes rather than their synchronized neuronal activity. Monitoring and removing these respiration variations led to a significant improvement in the identification of task-related activation and deactivation and only slight differences in regions correlated with the posterior cingulate at rest. Regressing out global signal changes or cueing the subject to breathe at a constant rate and depth resulted in an improved spatial overlap between deactivations and resting-state correlations among areas that showed deactivation",

Much of the discussion has focused on the relationship of these regions to a "default mode" of brain function. In early studies, investigators suggested that, the brain's default mode supports "self-referential" or "introspective" mental activity. Subsequently, regions of the default network have been more specifically related to the "internal narrative," the "autobiographical self," "stimulus independent thought," "mentalizing," and most recently "self-projection." However, the extant literature on the function of the default network is limited to adults, i.e., after the system has reached maturity. We hypothesized that further insight into the network's functioning could be achieved by characterizing its development. In the current study, we used resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to characterize the development of the brain's default network. We found that the default regions are only sparsely functionally connected at early school age (7-9 years old); over development, these regions integrate into a cohesive, interconnected network},

Genetic studies show a relation between the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele and the common form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and altered functional brain activation has been observed in non-demented APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers. Here we investigate the hypothesis of altered default-mode network brain responses in individuals with genetic risk for AD. Functional MRI was used to assess task-induced deactivation in 60 subjects of which 30 carried at least one copy of the APOE4 allele, and 30 non-carriers. Subjects were scanned while performing a semantic categorization task shown to promote episodic memory encoding. The results show patterns of deactivation consistent with the default-mode network. We also found reduced deactivation in non-demented APOE4 carriers compared to non-carriers, suggesting alterations in the default-mode network in the absence of dementia.

Here, we used functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in humans (n = 40) to identify 4 topographically distinct fronto-cerebellar circuits that target 1) motor cortex, 2) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 3) medial prefrontal cortex, and 4) anterior prefrontal cortex. All 4 circuits were replicated and dissociated in an independent data set (n = 40). Direct comparison of right- and left-seeded frontal regions revealed contralateral lateralization in the cerebellum for each of the segregated circuits. The presence of circuits that involve prefrontal regions confirms that the cerebellum participates in networks important to cognition including a specific fronto-cerebellar circuit that interacts with the default network. Overall, the extent of the cerebellum associated with prefrontal cortex included a large portion of the posterior hemispheres consistent with a prominent role of the cerebellum in nonmotor functions. We conclude by providing a provisional map of the topography of the cerebellum based on functional correlations with the frontal cortex",

    abstract = "Previous functional neuroimaging studies have shown brain activation abnormalities in clinically presymptomatic carriers of the Huntington's disease (preHD) gene mutation when performing complex cognitive tasks. However, little is known about the neural correlates of attentional processes in preHD. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate basic aspects of attentional processing in preHD individuals (n = 18) compared to healthy participants (n = 18) during an alertness task. Uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used to assess task-related regional brain activation and functional network connectivity. Compared to healthy controls, preHD individuals near to the estimated onset of clinical signs showed lower activation of right frontostriatal regions during phasic alertness (P < 0.001, uncorrected). Decreased striatal activation in this preHD subgroup was also evident when compared with those preHD individuals far from the estimated onset of HD signs. Lower putaminal activity was associated with longer reaction times and with proximity to onset. In addition, preHD participants near to onset had lower functional connectivity of motor regions when compared with controls and preHD individuals far from onset. Our data suggest that while alertness-related performance remains normal, the underlying frontostriatal activity and motor cortex connectivity decline only when approaching the onset of unequivocal signs of HD. However, these attentional network changes might not be the sole explanation for the differences in cognitive task performance previously observed in preHD.

One is the temporal nature of the functional interactions among nodes of the network in the resting-state, usually assumed to be static. The second is possible influences of previous brain states on the spatial patterns (i.e., the brain regions involved) of functional connectivity (FC) in the DN at rest. The goal of the current study was to investigate modulations in both the spatial and temporal domains. We compared the resting-state FC of the DN in two runs that were separated by a 45 minute interval containing cognitive task execution. We used partial least squares (PLS), which allowed us to identify FC spatiotemporal patterns in the two runs and to determine differences between them. Our results revealed two primary modes of FC, assessed using a posterior cingulate seed--a robust correlation among DN regions that is stable both spatially and temporally, and a second pattern that is reduced in spatial extent and more variable temporally after cognitive tasks, showing switching between connectivity with certain DN regions and connectivity with other areas, including some task-related regions. Therefore, the DN seems to exhibit two simultaneous FC dynamics at rest. The first is spatially invariant and insensitive to previous brain states, suggesting that the DN maintains some temporally stable functional connections. The second dynamic is more variable and is seen more strongly when the resting-state follows a period of task execution, suggesting an after-effect of the cognitive activity engaged during task that carries over into resting-state periods",

Aberrant functional network connectivity (FNC, temporal relationships among independent component time courses) has also been found in SZ by a previous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. However, no study has yet determined if topological properties of FNC are also altered in SZ. In this study, small-world network metrics of FNC during the resting state were examined in both healthy controls (HCs) and SZ subjects. FMRI data were obtained from 19 HCs and 19 SZ. Brain images were decomposed into independent components (ICs) by group independent component analysis (ICA). FNC maps were constructed via a partial correlation analysis of ICA time courses. A set of undirected graphs were built by thresholding the FNC maps and the small-world network metrics of these maps were evaluated. Our results demonstrated significantly altered topological properties of FNC in SZ relative to controls. In addition, topological measures of many ICs involving frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar areas were altered in SZ relative to controls. Specifically, topological measures of whole network and specific components in SZ were correlated with scores on the negative symptom scale of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). These findings suggest that aberrant architecture of small-world brain topology in SZ consists of ICA temporally coherent brain networks.",

    abstract = "Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.",

    abstract = "Resting state studies of spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal have shown great promise in mapping the brain's intrinsic, large-scale functional architecture. An important data preprocessing step used to enhance the quality of these observations has been removal of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations common to the whole brain (the so-called global signal). One reproducible consequence of global signal removal has been the finding that spontaneous BOLD fluctuations in the default mode network and an extended dorsal attention system are consistently anticorrelated, a relationship that these two systems exhibit during task performance. The dependence of these resting-state anticorrelations on global signal removal has raised important questions regarding the nature of the global signal, the validity of global signal removal, and the appropriate interpretation of observed anticorrelated brain networks. In this study, we investigate several properties of the global signal and find that it is, indeed, global, not residing preferentially in systems exhibiting anticorrelations. We detail the influence of global signal removal on resting state correlation maps both mathematically and empirically, showing an enhancement in detection of system-specific correlations and improvement in the correspondence between resting-state correlations and anatomy. Finally, we show that several characteristics of anticorrelated networks including their spatial distribution, cross-subject consistency, presence with modified whole brain masks, and existence before global regression are not attributable to global signal removal and therefore suggest a biological basis.",

Our model permits exact closed-form solutions for both the posterior activation effect estimates and the model evidence. To learn RS networks, graphical LASSO and the oracle approximating shrinkage technique are deployed. On a cohort of 65 subjects, we demonstrate increased sensitivity in fMRI activation detection using our connectivity-informed model over the standard univariate approach. Our results thus provide further evidence for the presence of an intrinsic relationship between brain activity during rest and task, the exploitation of which enables higher detection power in task-driven studies.",

    abstract = "Adaptive behaviour, cognition and emotion are the result of a bewildering variety of brain spatio-temporal activity patterns. An important problem in neuroscience is to understand the mechanism by which the human brain's 100 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses manage to produce this large repertoire of cortical configurations in a flexible manner. In addition, it is recognized that temporal correlations across such configurations cannot be arbitrary, but they need to meet two conflicting demands: while diverse cortical areas should remain functionally segregated from each other, they must still perform as a collective, i.e. they are functionally integrated. Here, we investigate these large-scale dynamical properties by inspecting the character of the spatio-temporal correlations of brain resting-state activity. In physical systems, these correlations in space and time are captured by measuring the correlation coefficient between a signal recorded at two different points in space at two different times. We show that this two-point correlation function extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data exhibits self-similarity in space and time. In space, self-similarity is revealed by considering three successive spatial coarse-graining steps while in time it is revealed by the 1/f frequency behaviour of the power spectrum. The uncovered dynamical self-similarity implies that the brain is spontaneously at a continuously changing (in space and time) intermediate state between two extremes, one of excessive cortical integration and the other of complete segregation. This dynamical property may be seen as an important marker of brain well-being in both health and disease.",

    abstract = "A fundamental component of brain development is the formation of large-scale networks across the cortex. One such network, the default network, undergoes a protracted development, displaying weak connectivity in childhood that strengthens in adolescence and becomes most robust in adulthood. Little is known about the genetic contributions to default network connectivity in adulthood or during development. Alterations in connectivity between posterior and frontal portions of the default network have been associated with several psychological disorders, including anxiety, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These disorders have also been linked to variants of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). The LA allele of 5-HTTLPR results in higher serotonin transporter expression than the S allele or the rarer LG allele. 5-HTTLPR may influence default network connectivity, as the superior medial frontal region has been shown to be sensitive to changes in serotonin. Also, serotonin as a growth factor early in development may alter large-scale networks such as the default network. The present study examined the influence of 5-HTTLPR variants on connectivity between the posterior and frontal structures and its development in a cross-sectional study of 39 healthy children and adolescents. We found that children and adolescents homozygous for the S allele (S/S, n=10) showed weaker connectivity in the superior medial frontal cortex compared to those homozygous for the LA allele (LA/LA, n=13) or heterozygotes (S/LA, S/LG, n=16). Moreover, there was an age-by-genotype interaction, such that those with LA/LA genotype had the steepest age-related increase in connectivity between the posterior hub and superior medial frontal cortex, followed by heterozygotes. In contrast, individuals with the S/S genotype had the least age-related increase in connectivity strength. This preliminary report expands our understanding of the genetic influences on the development of large-scale brain connectivity and lays down the foundation for future research and replication of the results with a larger sample",

Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity within a specific resting-state neural network--the default-mode network--that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression and in healthy controls.METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with major depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on functional connectivity.RESULTS: Resting-state subgenual cingulate and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore default-mode functional connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative, resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual subjects",

Here we apply probabilistic independent component analysis (pICA) to resting state fMRI series in 25 schizophrenia patients and 25 matched healthy controls. We use an automated algorithm to extract the ICA component representing the default mode network (DMN) as defined by a DMN-specific set of 14 brain regions, resulting in z-scores for each voxel of the (whole-brain) statistical map. While goodness of fit was found to be similar between the groups, the region of interest (ROI) as well as voxel-wise analysis of the DMN showed significant differences between groups. Healthy controls revealed stronger effects of pICA-derived connectivity measures in right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, bilateral medial frontal cortex, left precuneus and left posterior lateral parietal cortex, while stronger effects in schizophrenia patients were found in the right amygdala, left orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate and bilateral inferior temporal cortices. In patients, we also found an inverse correlation of negative symptoms with right anterior prefrontal cortex activity at rest and negative symptoms. These findings suggest that aberrant default mode network connectivity contributes to regional functional pathology in schizophrenia and bears significance for core symptoms",

However, it remains unclear whether frequency-specific characteristics exist in the resting-state fMRI signal. In this study, fMRI signals in five functional brain networks (sensorimotor, 'default mode', visual, amygdala, and hippocampus) were decomposed into various frequency bands within a low-frequency range (0-0.24 Hz). Results show that the correlations in cortical networks concentrate within ultra-low frequencies (0.01-0.06 Hz) while connections within limbic networks distribute over a wider frequency range (0.01-0.14 Hz), suggesting distinct frequency-specific features in the resting-state fMRI signal within these functional networks. Moreover, the connectivity decay rates along the frequency bands are positively correlated with the physical distances between connected brain regions and seed points. This distance-frequency relationship might be attributed to a larger attenuation of synchrony of brain regions separated with longer distance and/or connected with more synaptic steps.",

    abstract = "Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures changes in blood oxygenation, which is affected by physiological processes, including cardiac pulsation, breathing, and low frequency oscillations (LFO). It is challenging to identify spatial and temporal effects of these processes on the BOLD signal because the low sampling rate of BOLD leads to aliasing of higher frequency physiological signal components. In this study, we used concurrent functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and fMRI on 6 subjects during a resting state scan. To reduce aliasing, the BOLD fMRI acquisition was repeatedly performed on a set of sequentially acquired slice stacks to lower the TR to 0.5s while retaining high spatial resolution. Regressor interpolation at progressive time delays (RIPTiDe) method was used, in which physiological signal acquired by fNIRS (without aliasing) and its temporal shifts were used as regressors in the fMRI analysis to determine the magnitude and timing of the effects of various physiological processes on the BOLD signal. The details of the timing of the passage of the cardiac pulsation wave and of the cerebral blood itself were mapped. The result suggests that the cardiac signal affects the voxels near large blood vessels (arteries and veins) most strongly, while LFO mostly affected the drainage veins. We hypothesize that this could be the result of differences in the cerebral blood path lengths, and differences in the dynamics of the propagation of the signals. Together these results validate and extend a novel imaging technique to dynamically track the pulse-wave and bulk blood flow with concurrent fMRI and fNIRS",

    abstract = "Human brain networks can be characterized at different temporal or spatial scales given by the age of the subject or the spatial resolution of the neuroimaging method. Integration of data across scales can only be successful if the combined networks show a similar architecture. One way to compare networks is to look at spatial features, based on fiber length, and topological features of individual nodes where outlier nodes form single node motifs whose frequency yields a fingerprint of the network. Here, we observe how characteristic single node motifs change over age (12-23 years) and network size (414, 813, and 1615 nodes) for diffusion tensor imaging structural connectivity in healthy human subjects. First, we find the number and diversity of motifs in a network to be strongly correlated. Second, comparing different scales, the number and diversity of motifs varied across the temporal (subject age) and spatial (network resolution) scale: certain motifs might only occur at one spatial scale or for a certain age range. Third, regions of interest which show one motif at a lower resolution may show a range of motifs at a higher resolution which may or may not include the original motif at the lower resolution. Therefore, both the type and localization of motifs differ for different spatial resolutions. Our results also indicate that spatial resolution has a higher effect on topological measures whereas spatial measures, based on fiber lengths, remain more comparable between resolutions. Therefore, spatial resolution is crucial when comparing characteristic node fingerprints given by topological and spatial network features. As node motifs are based on topological and spatial properties of brain connectivity networks, these conclusions are also relevant to other studies using connectome analysis",

In the present study we directly investigated off-line processing of associative memory formation in the human brain. Subjects' regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a surrogate marker of neural activity during rest was measured by MR-based perfusion imaging in a sample of 14 healthy male subjects prior to (Pre2) and after (Post) extensive learning of 24 face-name associations within a selective reminding task (SR). Results demonstrated significant Post-Pre2 rCBF increases in hippocampal and temporal lobe regions, while in a control comparison of two perfusion scans with no learning task in-between (Pre2-Pre1) no differences in rCBF emerged. Post perfusion scanning was followed by a surprise cued associative recall task from which two types of correctly retrieved names were obtained: older names already correctly retrieved at least once during one of the SR blocks, and recent names acquired during the last SR block immediately prior to the Post scan. In the anterior hippocampus individual perfusion increases were correlated with both correct retrievals of older and recent names. By contrast, older but not recently learned names showed a significant correlation with perfusion increases in the left lateral temporal cortex known to be associated with long-term memory. Recent, but not older names were correlated with dopaminergic midbrain structures reported to contribute to the persistence of memory traces for novel information. Although the direct investigation of off-line memory processing did not permit concomitant experimental control, neither intentional rehearsal, nor substantial variations in subjects' states of alertness appear to contribute to present results. We suggest that the observed rCBF increases might reflect processes that possibly contribute to the long-term persistence of memory traces.",

However, the functional significance of these spontaneous brain activity fluctuations remains unclear. The aim of this study was to test if the integrity of this resting-state connectivity pattern in the default network would differ in different pathological alterations of consciousness. Fourteen non-communicative brain-damaged patients and 14 healthy controls participated in the study. Connectivity was investigated using probabilistic independent component analysis, and an automated template-matching component selection approach. Connectivity in all default network areas was found to be negatively correlated with the degree of clinical consciousness impairment, ranging from healthy controls and locked-in syndrome to minimally conscious, vegetative then coma patients. Furthermore, precuneus connectivity was found to be significantly stronger in minimally conscious patients as compared with unconscious patients. Locked-in syndrome patient's default network connectivity was not significantly different from controls. Our results show that default network connectivity is decreased in severely brain-damaged patients, in proportion to their degree of consciousness impairment. Future prospective studies in a larger patient population are needed in order to evaluate the prognostic value of the presented methodology.",

To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Using a novel continuous acquisition "rest-task-rest" design, we found that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE:This result supports the model that endogenous low frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous stimulation. Moreover, it suggests that large-scale neurocognitive systems measured using fMRI, like the heart and other physiological systems subjected to external demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return to a stable baseline state.},

This study examined changes in the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the amygdala before and after Pavlovian fear conditioning, an emotional learning task. Behavioral results from the conditioning session revealed that participants learned normally and fMRI data recorded during learning identified a number of stimulus-evoked changes that were consistent with previous work. A direct comparison between the pre- and post-conditioning amygdala connectivity revealed a region of dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the superior frontal gyrus that showed a significant increase in connectivity following the conditioning session. A behavioral measure of explicit memory performance was positively correlated with the change in amygdala connectivity within a neighboring region in the superior frontal gyrus. Additionally, an implicit autonomic measure of conditioning was positively correlated with the change in connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The resting-state data show that amygdala connectivity is altered following Pavlovian fear conditioning and that these changes are also related to behavioral outcomes. These alterations may reflect the operation of a consolidation process that strengthens neural connections to support memory after the learning event",

According to the ICC of the usage strength of the independent network component defined by the root mean square of the temporal weights of the network components, the default mode network centered at the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, the superior parietal, and secondary motor networks showed a high temporal stability throughout the day (ICC>0.5). However, high intra-individual dynamicity was observed in the default mode network, including the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex or posterior-anterior cingulate cortex, the hippocampal network, and the parietal and temporal networks. Seed correlation analysis showed a highly stable (ICC>0.5) extent of functionally connected regions from the posterior cingulate cortex, but poor stability from the hippocampus throughout the day. Graph-theoretical analysis using local and global network efficiency suggested that local brain networks are temporally stable but that long-range integration behaves dynamically in the course of a day.

However, the alteration of coherent neural activities in such a default-mode network (DMN) in mTLE has yet to be investigated. The present study analyzed the resting-state functional MRI data from two groups of mTLE patients with left and right hippocampal sclerosis using independent component analysis. In comparison with healthy controls, decreased functional connectivity in the dorsal mesial prefrontal cortex, mesial temporal lobe and inferior temporal cortex was observed in these two patient groups. Moreover, the right but not left mTLE patients showed bilaterally decreased functional connectivity in the mesial temporal lobe and increased functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex. The decreased functional connectivity of the mesial temporal lobe was related to the epilepsy duration, suggesting that the posterior cingulate cortex may play a compensatory role for the altered DMN in the right mTLE. These findings indicate that the DMN is widely affected even if a single network node is impaired. An extensive regional overlap between the DMN and the previously described epileptic network suggests that the widespread functional impairments in mTLE may attribute to an aberrant DMN. The distinct patterns of the DMN between the left and right mTLE support a view that there are different pathological mechanisms underlying these two types of epilepsies.",

Results of this fMRI experiment were used to determine seed voxel regions for fcMRI analysis. Intrahemispheric connectivities in the sensorimotor forelimb representations in both hemispheres are largely unaffected by deafferentation, whereas substantial disruption of interhemispheric sensorimotor cortical connectivity occurs. In addition, significant intra- and interhemispheric changes in connectivities of thalamic nuclei were found. These are the central findings of the study. They could not have been obtained from fMRI studies alone-both fMRI and fcMRI are needed. The combination provides a general marker for brain plasticity. The rat visual system was studied in the same animals as a control. No neuroplastic changes in connectivities were found in the primary visual cortex upon forelimb deafferentation.

Such regions are essential for coordinating brain functions due to their connectivity with numerous regions with a variety of specializations. Current structural and functional connectivity methods generally agree that default mode network (DMN) regions have among the highest global brain connectivity (GBC). We developed two novel statistical approaches using resting state functional connectivity MRI-weighted and unweighted GBC (wGBC and uGBC)-to test the hypothesis that the highest global connectivity also occurs in the cognitive control network (CCN), a network anti-correlated with the DMN across a variety of tasks. High global connectivity was found in both CCN and DMN. The newly developed wGBC approach improves upon existing methods by quantifying inter-subject consistency, quantifying the highest GBC values by percentage, and avoiding arbitrarily connection strength thresholding. The uGBC approach is based on graph theory and includes many of these improvements, but still requires an arbitrary connection threshold. We found high GBC in several subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus, basal ganglia) only with wGBC despite the regions' extensive anatomical connectivity. These results demonstrate the complementary utility of wGBC and uGBC analyses for the characterization of the most highly connected, and thus most functionally important, regions of the brain. Additionally, the high connectivity of both the CCN and the DMN demonstrates that brain regions outside primary sensory-motor networks are highly involved in coordinating information throughout the brain.",

The PCC is a major node within the default mode network (DMN) and has high metabolic activity and dense structural connectivity to widespread brain regions, which suggests it has a role as a cortical hub. The region appears to be involved in internally directed thought, for example, memory recollection. However, recent nonhuman primate work provides evidence for a more active role in the control of cognition, through signaling an environmental change and the need to alter behavior. For an organism to flexibly react to a changing environment, information processed in functionally distinct brain networks needs to be integrated by such a cortical hub. If the PCC is involved in this process, its brain activity should show a complex and dynamic pattern that partially reflects activity in other brain networks. Using fMRI in humans and a multivariate analysis, we demonstrate that the PCC shows this type of complex functional architecture, where echoes of multiple other brain networks are seen in separable yet overlapping subregions. For example, a predominantly ventral region shows strong functional connectivity to the rest of the DMN, whereas two subregions within the dorsal PCC show high connectivity to frontoparietal networks involved in cognitive control. PCC subregions showed distinct patterns of activity modulation during the performance of an attentionally demanding task, suggesting that parts of the dorsal PCC interact with frontoparietal networks to regulate the balance between internally and externally directed cognition",

    abstract = {Functional connectivity between different brain regions can be estimated from MRI data by computing the temporal correlation of low frequency (<0.1Hz) fluctuations in the MRI signal. These correlated fluctuations occur even when the subject is "at rest" (not asked to perform any particular task) and result from spontaneous neuronal activity synchronized within multiple distinct networks of brain regions. This estimate of connectivity, however, can be influenced by physiological noise, such as cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This brief review looks at the effect of physiological noise on estimates of resting-state functional connectivity, discusses ways to remove physiological noise, and provides a personal recollection of the early developments in these approaches. This review also discusses the importance of physiological noise correction and provides a summary of evidence demonstrating that functional connectivity does have a neuronal underpinning and cannot purely be the result of physiological noise},

    abstract = {The most recently encountered information is often most easily remembered in psychological tests of memory. Recent investigations of the neural basis of such "recency effects" have shown that activation in the lateral inferior parietal cortex (LIPC) tracks the recency of a probe item when subjects make recognition memory judgments. A key question regarding recency effects in the LIPC is whether they fundamentally reflect the storage (and strength) of information in memory, or whether such effects are a consequence of task difficulty or an upswing in resting state network activity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we show that recency effects in the LIPC are independent of the difficulty of recognition memory decisions, that they are not a by-product of an increase in resting state network activity, and that they appear to dissociate from regions known to be involved in verbal working memory maintenance. We conclude with a discussion of two alternative explanations - the memory strength and "expectancy" hypotheses, respectively - of the parietal lobe recency effect.},

    abstract = "Correlated spontaneous activity in the resting brain is increasingly recognized as a useful index for inferring underlying functional-anatomic architecture. However, despite efforts for comparison with anatomical connectivity, neuronal origin of intrinsic functional connectivity (inFC) remains unclear. Conceptually, the source of inFC could be decomposed into causal components that reflect the efficacy of synaptic interactions and other components mediated by collective network dynamics (e.g., synchronization). To dissociate these components, it is useful to introduce another connectivity measure such as effective connectivity, which is a quantitative measure of causal interactions. Here, we present a direct comparison of inFC against emEC (effective connectivity probed with electrical microstimulation [EM]) in the somatosensory system of macaque monkeys. Simultaneous EM and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed strong emEC in several brain regions in a manner consistent with the anatomy of somatosensory system. Direct comparison of inFC and emEC revealed colocalization and overall positive correlation within the stimulated hemisphere. Interestingly, we found characteristic differences between inFC and emEC in their interhemispheric patterns. Our results suggest that intrahemispheric inFC reflects the efficacy of causal interactions, whereas interhemispheric inFC may arise from interactions akin to network-level synchronization that is not captured by emEC. © The Author 2011.

Five human subjects were imaged during resting state (visual fixation) at 3T using single-shot gradient echo planar imaging (EPI). Respiration and cardiac signals were concurrently recorded for retrospectively removing fluctuations due to these physiologic activities. Patterns of singularity in the complex plane (PSC) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) were used to study the deterministic nonlinearity in resting state fMRI data. The results show that there is greater nonlinearity (higher PSC) and determinism (lower LZ) in gray matter compared to white matter and CSF. In addition, the removal of respiratory and cardiac pulsations decreases the nonlinearity and determinism but does not alter the relative difference between gray matter and white matter. Therefore, our results demonstrate that determinism and nonlinearity in the fMRI data are tissue-specific, suggesting that they reflect native physiologic and metabolic fluctuations and are not a result of physiologic artifacts due to respiration and cardiac pulsation.",

It remains unclear, however, the extent to which the function of the brain's interconnections are impacted by this condition. Presently, we utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate the synchronization of neural signals (i.e., functional connectivity) among brain regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) in a sample of 11 individuals with ETPKU and 11 age- and gender-matched neurologically intact controls. The DMN is a group of interconnected brain regions that are known to be generally more active during rest than during task performance. Data analysis revealed decreased functional connectivity among DMN regions for the ETPKU group compared with the control group. Within the PKU group, we also found a significant relationship between blood phenylalanine (phe) levels and the functional connectivity between select regions of the DMN. In conjunction with findings from another recent fMRI study (Christ, Moffitt et al. 2010), the present results suggest that ETPKU-related deficiencies in functional connectivity are pervasive. The current findings also provide initial evidence that the extent of such impairment may be moderated in part by blood phe levels",

    abstract = {Functional networks are usually accessed with "resting-state" functional magnetic resonance imaging using preselected "seeds" regions. Frequently, however, the selection of the seed locations is arbitrary. Recently, we proposed local functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM), an ultrafast data-driven to locate highly connected brain regions (functional hubs). Here, we used the functional hubs obtained from local FCDM to determine the functional networks of the resting state in 979 healthy subjects without a priori hypotheses on seed locations. In addition, we computed the global functional connectivity hubs. Seven networks covering 80\% of the gray matter volume were identified. Four major cortical hubs (ventral precuneus/posterior cingulate, inferior parietal cortex, cuneus, and postcentral gyrus) were linked to 4 cortical networks (default mode, dorsal attention, visual, and somatosensory). Three subcortical networks were associated to the major subcortical hubs (cerebellum, thalamus, and amygdala). The networks differed in their resting activity and topology. The higher coupling and overlap of subcortical networks was associated to higher contribution of short-range functional connectivity in thalamus and cerebellum. Whereas cortical local FCD hubs were also hubs of long-range connectivity, which corroborates the key role of cortical hubs in network architecture, subcortical hubs had minimal long-range connectivity. The significant variability among functional networks may underlie their sensitivity/resilience to neuropathology. © 2011 The Author.},

    abstract = "Increasing attention has recently been directed to the applications of pattern recognition and brain imaging techniques in the effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most of the existing research focuses on the use of single-modal (e.g., structural or functional MRI) or single-level (e.g., brain local or connectivity metrics) biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. In this study, we propose a methodological framework, called multi-modal imaging and multi-level characteristics with multi-classifier (M3), to discriminate patients with AD from healthy controls. This approach involved data analysis from two imaging modalities: structural MRI, which was used to measure regional gray matter volume, and resting-state functional MRI, which was used to measure three different levels of functional characteristics, including the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and regional functional connectivity strength (RFCS). For each metric, we computed the values of ninety regions of interest derived from a prior atlas, which were then further trained using a multi-classifier based on four maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis base classifiers. The performance of this method was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Applying the M3 approach to the dataset containing 16 AD patients and 22 healthy controls led to a classification accuracy of 89.47\% with a sensitivity of 87.50\% and a specificity of 90.91\%. Further analysis revealed that the most discriminative features for classification are predominantly involved in several default-mode (medial frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus), occipital (fusiform gyrus, inferior and middle occipital gyrus) and subcortical (amygdale and pallidum of lenticular nucleus) regions. Thus, the M3 method shows promising classification performance by incorporating information from different imaging modalities and different functional properties, and it has the potential to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation of AD",

We show with resting state fMRI data from 58 healthy adolescent and young adult volunteers that points of maximal connectivity between the IPS and other regions in the dorsal attention and cinguloinsular networks are topographically organized, with at least seven maps of the IPS region in each hemisphere. Distinct clusters of the IPS exhibited differential connectivity to auditory, visual, somatosen- sory, and default mode networks, suggesting local specialization within the IPS region for different sensory modalities. In an independent task activation paradigm with 16 subjects, attention to different sensory modalities showed similar functional specialization within the left intraparietal sulcus region. The default mode network, in contrast, did not show a topographical relationship between regions in the network, but rather maximal connectivity in each region to a single central cluster of the other regions. The topographical architecture of multisensory attention may represent a mechanism for specificity in top-down control of attention from dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortex and may represent an organizational unit for multisensory representations in the brain.",

CIS iteratively optimizes a grouping of vertexes in a weighted graph, using a density metric computed based on the input and output weights of a candidate cluster. In this study, CIS is able to detect the overlapped clusters in a simulated dataset. CIS also detects that the default mode network and the task positive network, which were known as two anti-correlated networks, are overlapped at the posterior cingulate cortex and the lateral parietal cortex. CIS also detects the conventional functional clusters in the whole brain neural network (e.g., the visual cluster, the motor cluster, the frontal cluster, etc.), as well as meaningful overlaps, and also revealed the possible existence of an emotional memory functional cluster. CIS was able to identify several hub regions actively participating in many clusters. With the ability to reveal overlapping functional clusters, CIS is potentially useful in revealing the delicate architecture of the brain neural network.",

    abstract = "The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects the school-age population and has large social costs. The scientific community is still lacking a pathophysiological model of the disorder and there are no objective biomarkers to support the diagnosis. In 2011 the ADHD-200 Consortium provided a rich, heterogeneous neuroimaging dataset aimed at studying neural correlates of ADHD and to promote the development of systems for automated diagnosis. Concurrently a competition was set up with the goal of addressing the wide range of different types of data for the accurate prediction of the presence of ADHD. Phenotypic information, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and resting state fMRI recordings were provided for nearly 1000 typical and non-typical young individuals. Data were collected by eight different research centers in the consortium. This work is not concerned with the main task of the contest, i.e., achieving a high prediction accuracy on the competition dataset, but we rather address the proper handling of such a heterogeneous dataset when performing classification-based analysis. Our interest lies in the clustered structure of the data causing the so-called batch effects which have strong impact when assessing the performance of classifiers built on the ADHD-200 dataset. We propose a method to eliminate the biases introduced by such batch effects. Its application on the ADHD-200 dataset generates such a significant drop in prediction accuracy that most of the conclusions from a standard analysis had to be revised. In addition we propose to adopt the dissimilarity representation to set up effective representation spaces for the heterogeneous ADHD-200 dataset. Moreover we propose to evaluate the quality of predictions through a recently proposed test of independence in order to cope with the unbalancedness of the dataset",

Both patients and healthy comparison subjects were scanned using a volumetric three-dimensional spoiled gradient recall sequence and a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. Psychopathology of first-episode schizophrenia patients was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Optimized voxel-based morphometry was used to characterize gray matter deficits in schizophrenia patients. The clinical significance of regional volume reduction was investigated by examining its association with symptoms in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and with alterations in resting state functional connectivity when brain regions with gray matter volume reduction were used as seed areas.RESULTS:Significantly decreased gray matter volume was observed in schizophrenia patients in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann's area 41), right middle temporal gyrus (Brodmann's area 21), and right anterior cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 32). Decreased gray matter volume in these brain regions was related to greater disturbance as shown on PANSS scores for positive symptoms, general psychopathology symptoms, thought disturbance, activation, paranoia, and impulsive aggression as well as total PANSS scores. A positive correlation was observed between PANSS scores for thought disturbance and temporo-putamen connectivity, and negative correlations were found between temporo-precuneus connectivity and total PANSS scores as well as scores for negative symptoms and anergia.CONCLUSIONS:The findings revealed volume loss in the right superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and right anterior cingulate gyrus among antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients. In addition, the functional networks involving the right superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus were associated with clinical symptom severity.

    abstract = "Here we develop a measure of functional connectivity describing the degree of covariability between a brain region and the rest of the brain. This measure is based on previous formulas for the mutual information (MI) between clusters of regions in the frequency domain. Under the current scenario, the MI can be given as a simple monotonous function of the multiple coherence and it leads to an easy visual representation of connectivity patterns. Computationally efficient formulas, adequate for short time series, are presented and applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data measured in subjects (N=34) performing a working memory task or being at rest. While resting state coherence in high (0.17-0.25 Hz) and middle (0.08-0.17 Hz) frequency intervals is bilaterally salient in several limbic and temporal areas including the insula, the amygdala, and the primary auditory cortex, low frequencies (<0.08 Hz) have greatest connectivity in frontal structures. Results from the comparison between resting and N-back conditions show enhanced low frequency coherence in many of the areas previously reported in standard fMRI activation studies of working memory, but task related reductions in high frequency connectivity are also found in regions of the default mode network. Finally, potentially confounding effects of head movement and regional volume on MI are identified and addressed.",

    abstract = "Resting-state fMRI has emerged as an important method for assessing neural networks, enabling extensive connectivity analyses between multiple brain regions. Among the analysis techniques proposed, partial directed coherence (PDC) provides a promising tool to unveil causal connectivity networks in the frequency domain. Using the MRI time series obtained from the rat sensorimotor system, we applied PDC analysis to determine the frequency-dependent causality networks. In particular, we compared in vivo and post-mortem conditions to establish the statistical significance of directional PDC values. Our results demonstrate that two distinctive frequency populations drive the causality networks; significant, high-frequency causal connections clustered in the range of 0.2-0.4 Hz and the frequently-documented low-frequency connections below 0.15 Hz. Frequency-dependence and directionality of the causal connection are characteristic between sensorimotor regions, implying the functional role of frequency bands to transport specific resting-state signals. In particular, while both intra- and inter-hemispheric causal connections between heterologous sensorimotor regions are robust over all frequency levels, the bilaterally homologous regions are inter-hemispherically linked mostly via low-frequency components. We also discovered a significant, frequency-independent, unidirectional connection from motor cortex to thalamus, indicating dominant cortical inputs to the thalamus in the absence of external stimuli. Additionally, to address factors underlying the measurement error, we performed signal simulations and revealed that the interactive MRI system noise alone is a likely source of the inaccurate PDC values. This work demonstrates technical basis for the PDC analysis of resting-state fMRI time series and the presence of frequency-dependent causality networks in the sensorimotor system",

The functional connectivity maps created were stringently validated by controlling for false positive detection of correlation, the physiologic basis of the signal source, as well as quantitatively evaluating the reproducibility of maps.

Several studies have also suggested its potential as a biomarker for neuropsychiatric disease. In the current study, we quantified ALFF to determine changes in intrinsic neural oscillations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on and off L-DOPA. Twenty-four PD patients and 24 healthy age-matched controls participated in the study. PD patients underwent two resting state fMRI sessions, either ON a controlled dose of L-DOPA or following a placebo pill (OFF). Control participants underwent one test session. We found that there was increased amplitude of low frequency BOLD signal oscillations for PD patients OFF L-DOPA in the primary and secondary motor areas, and in the middle and medial prefrontal cortices. L-DOPA significantly reduced the amplitude of low frequency oscillations within these regions. The degree of ALFF in the premotor cortex predicted patients' motor performance as measured by the Grooved Pegboard task, such that greater ALFF was associated with poorer performance. These results are in line with the pathophysiology of PD, which shows changes in neural oscillations. Thus, frequency domain analyses of resting state BOLD fMRI signals may provide a useful means to study the pathophysiology of PD and the physiology of the brain's dopaminergic pathways",

We have used the resting state fMRI data of 3 subjects with 10 minute resting state functional images via a 3T Siemens scanner. we used cross correlation for functional analysis and reported thalamocortical results with pvalue=0.01 and cluster size=100, Then showed corresponding tracts connecting premotor cortex and thalamus. In addition, both techniques correspond well to histological delineation and invasive tract tracing, which provides a 'gold standard' validation of the two techniques.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: The default-mode network (DMN) is a functional network with increasing relevance for psychiatric research, characterized by increased activation at rest and decreased activation during task performance. The degree of DMN deactivation during a cognitively demanding task depends on its difficulty. However, the relation of hemodynamic responses in the resting phase after a preceding cognitive challenge remains relatively unexplored. We test the hypothesis that the degree of activation of the DMN following cognitive challenge is influenced by the cognitive load of a preceding working-memory task.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-five healthy subjects were investigated with functional MRI at 3 Tesla while performing a working-memory task with embedded short resting phases. Data were decomposed into statistically independent spatio-temporal components using Tensor Independent Component Analysis (TICA). The DMN was selected using a template-matching procedure. The spatial map contained rest-related activations in the medial frontal cortex, ventral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. The time course of the DMN revealed increased activation at rest after 1-back and 2-back blocks compared to the activation after a 0-back block.CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We present evidence that a cognitively challenging working-memory task is followed by greater activation of the DMN than a simple letter-matching task. This might be interpreted as a functional correlate of self-evaluation and reflection of the preceding task or as relocation of cerebral resources representing recovery from high cognitive demands. This finding is highly relevant for neuroimaging studies which include resting phases in cognitive tasks as stable baseline conditions. Further studies investigating the DMN should take possible interactions of tasks and subsequent resting phases into account",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share overlapping symptoms and genetic etiology. Functional brain dysconnectivity is seen in both disorders. METHODS: We compared 70 schizophrenia and 64 psychotic bipolar probands, their respective unaffected first-degree relatives (n = 70, and n = 52), and 118 healthy subjects, all group age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched. We used functional network connectivity analysis to measure differential connectivity among 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state networks. First, we examined connectivity differences between probands and control subjects. Next, we probed these dysfunctional connections in relatives for potential endophenotypes. Network connectivity was then correlated with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores to reveal clinical relationships. RESULTS: Three different network pairs were differentially connected in probands (false-discovery rate corrected q < .05) involving five individual resting-state networks: (A) fronto/occipital, (B) anterior default mode/prefrontal, (C) meso/paralimbic, (D) fronto-temporal/paralimbic, and (E) sensory-motor. One abnormal pair was unique to schizophrenia, (C-E), one unique to bipolar, (C-D), and one (A-B) was shared. Two of these three combinations (A-B, C-E) were also abnormal in bipolar relatives but none was normal in schizophrenia relatives (nonsignificant trend for C-E). The paralimbic circuit (C-D), which uniquely distinguished bipolar probands, contained multiple mood-relevant regions. Network relationship C-D correlated significantly with PANSS negative scores in bipolar probands, and A-B with PANSS positive and general scores in schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar probands share several abnormal resting state network connections, but there are also unique neural network underpinnings between disorders. We identified specific connections that might also be candidate psychosis endophenotypes",

Resting-state functional connectivity individualizes the prewired, parallel close-looped sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective networks passing through the cerebellum. These results are un agreement with activation maps obtained during stimulation functional neuroimaging or inferred from neurological deficits due to cerebellar lesions. Therefore, neuroimaging supports the hypothesis that cerebellum constitutes a general modulator involved in optimizing mental performance and computing internal models. However, the great challenges will remain to unravel: (1) the functional role of red and bulbar olivary nuclei, (2) the information processing in the cerebellar microcircuitry, and (3) the abstract computation performed by the cerebellum and shared by sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective domains",

Other studies using MEG and cortical thickness measures, however, show more global long distance connectivity changes, both in functional and structural imaging data. The form and role of functional connectivity changes thus remains ambiguous. The current study shows more conclusive data on connectivity changes in early AD using graph analysis on resting-state condition fMRI data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 18 mild AD patients and 21 healthy age-matched control subjects without memory complaints were investigated in resting-state condition with MRI at 1.5 Tesla. Functional coupling between brain regions was calculated on the basis of pair-wise synchronizations between regional time-series. Local (cluster coefficient) and global (path length) network measures were quantitatively defined. Compared to controls, the characteristic path length of AD functional networks is closer to the theoretical values of random networks, while no significant differences were found in cluster coefficient. The whole-brain average synchronization does not differ between Alzheimer and healthy control groups. Post-hoc analysis of the regional synchronization reveals increased AD synchronization involving the frontal cortices and generalized decreases located at the parietal and occipital regions. This effectively translates in a global reduction of functional long-distance links between frontal and caudal brain regions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We present evidence of AD-induced changes in global brain functional connectivity specifically affecting long-distance connectivity. This finding is highly relevant for it supports the anterior-posterior disconnection theory and its role in AD.

One explanation for these findings is that there are abnormalities in the interhemispheric connectivity of auditory cortex pathways in AH patients; as yet this explanation has not been experimentally investigated. We assessed the interhemispheric connectivity of both primary (A1) and secondary (A2) auditory cortices in n=13 AH patients, n=13 schizophrenia patients without auditory hallucinations (non-AH) and n=16 healthy controls using functional connectivity measures from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.METHOD: Functional connectivity was estimated from resting state fMRI data using regions of interest defined for each participant based on functional activation maps in response to passive listening to words. Additionally, stimulus-induced responses were regressed out of the stimulus data and the functional connectivity was estimated for the same regions to investigate the reliability of the estimates.RESULTS: AH patients had significantly reduced interhemispheric connectivity in both A1 and A2 when compared with non-AH patients and healthy controls. The latter two groups did not show any differences in functional connectivity. Further, this pattern of findings was similar across the two datasets, indicating the reliability of our estimates.CONCLUSIONS: These data have identified a trait deficit specific to AH patients. Since this deficit was characterized within both A1 and A2 it is expected to result in the disruption of multiple auditory functions, for example, the integration of basic auditory information between hemispheres (via A1) and higher-order language processing abilities (via A2).",

Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has been proven to be an effective imaging technique to obtain CVR maps when subjects perform CO(2) inhalation or a breath-holding (BH) task. Here we propose a novel way to process the fMRI data obtained during a blocked BH task by using simultaneously collected near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data as regressors to estimate the vascular contribution to the BOLD signal. Six healthy subjects underwent a 6min 30s resting state (RS) fMRI scan, followed by a scan of the same duration with a blocked BH task (5 breath holds with 20s durations separated by \~{}50s of regular breathing). NIRS data were recorded from a probe over the subjects' right prefrontal area. For each scan, the time course of changes in total hemoglobin ($\Delta$[tHb]) was calculated from the NIRS data, time shifted by various amounts, and resampled to the fMRI acquisition rate. Each shifted time course was used as regressor in a general linear model analysis. The maximum parameter estimate across all time shifts was calculated at all voxels in both the BH and RS scans, and then converted into signal percentage changes. The ratio of these signal changes generates a CVR map of the BH response, normalized to the resting state. The NIRS regressor method makes no assumptions about the shape (or presence) of the BH response, and allows direct, quantitative comparison of the vascular BOLD response to BH to the baseline map obtained in the resting state.",

As studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, the resting brain activity is associated with slowly fluctuating hemodynamic signals (\~{}10s). More recently, multimodal functional imaging studies involving simultaneous acquisition of BOLD-fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG) data have suggested that the relatively slow hemodynamic fluctuations of some resting state networks (RSNs) evinced in the BOLD data are related to much faster (\~{}100ms) transient brain states reflected in EEG signals, that are referred to as "microstates". To further elucidate the relationship between microstates and RSNs, we developed a fully data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneously recorded, high-density EEG and BOLD-fMRI data. Using independent component analysis (ICA) of the combined EEG and fMRI data, we identified thirteen microstates and ten RSNs that are organized independently in their temporal and spatial characteristics, respectively. We hypothesized that the intrinsic brain networks that are active at rest would be reflected in both the EEG data and the fMRI data. To test this hypothesis, the rapid fluctuations associated with each microstate were correlated with the BOLD-fMRI signal associated with each RSN. We found that each RSN was characterized further by a specific electrophysiological signature involving from one to a combination of several microstates. Moreover, by comparing the time course of EEG microstates to that of the whole-brain BOLD signal, on a multi-subject group level, we unraveled for the first time a set of microstate-associated networks that correspond to a range of previously described RSNs, including visual, sensorimotor, auditory, attention, frontal, visceromotor and default mode networks. These results extend our understanding of the electrophysiological signature of BOLD RSNs and demonstrate the intrinsic connection between the fast neuronal activity and slow hemodynamic fluctuations},

    abstract = "Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging has played an essential role in understanding neural circuitry and brain diseases. The vast majority of RSFC studies have been focused on positive RSFC, whereas our understanding about its conceptual counterpart - negative RSFC (i.e. anticorrelation) - remains elusive. To date, anticorrelated RSFC has yet been observed without the commonly used preprocessing step of global signal correction. However, this step can induce artifactual anticorrelation (Murphy et al., 2009), making it difficult to determine whether the observed anticorrelation in humans is a processing artifact (Fox et al., 2005). In this report we demonstrated robust anticorrelated RSFC in a well characterized frontolimbic circuit between the infralimbic cortex (IL) and amygdala in the awake rat. This anticorrelation was anatomically specific, highly reproducible and independent of preprocessing methods. Interestingly, this anticorrelated relationship was absent in anesthetized rats even with global signal correction, further supporting its functional significance. Establishing negative RSFC independent of data preprocessing methods will significantly enhance the applicability of RSFC in better understanding neural circuitries and brain networks. In addition, combining the neurobiological data of the IL-amygdala circuit in rodents, the finding of the present study will enable further investigation of the neurobiological basis underlying anticorrelation",

Changes in the resting state motor network were examined before training (Week 0), two weeks after the onset of training (Week 2), and immediately at the end of the training (Week 4). The resting state motor system was analyzed using group independent component analysis (ICA). Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) second-level analysis was conducted on independent z-maps generated by the group ICA. Three regions, namely right postcentral gyrus, and bilateral supramarginal gyri were found to be sensitive to the training duration. Specifically, the strength of resting state functional connectivity in the right postcentral gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus increased from Week 0 to Week 2, during which the behavioral performance improved significantly, and decreased from Week 2 to Week 4, during which there was no more significant improvement in behavioral performance. The strength of resting state functional connectivity in left supramarginal gyrus increased throughout the training. These results confirm changes in the resting state network during slow-learning stage of motor skill learning, and support the premise that the resting state networks play a role in improving performance.",

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements",

We investigated resting-state brain activity of stuttering subjects by analyzing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity (FC) and independent component analysis (ICA)-based FC. Forty-four adult males with developmental stuttering and 46 age-matched fluent male controls were scanned using resting-state fMRI. ALFF, ROI-based FCs and ICA-based FCs were compared between male stuttering subjects and fluent controls in a voxel-wise manner. Compared with fluent controls, stuttering subjects showed increased ALFF in left brain areas related to speech motor and auditory functions and bilateral prefrontal cortices related to cognitive control. However, stuttering subjects showed decreased ALFF in the left posterior language reception area and bilateral non-speech motor areas. ROI-based FC analysis revealed decreased FC between the posterior language area involved in the perception and decoding of sensory information and anterior brain area involved in the initiation of speech motor function, as well as increased FC within anterior or posterior speech- and language-associated areas and between the prefrontal areas and default-mode network (DMN) in stuttering subjects. ICA showed that stuttering subjects had decreased FC in the DMN and increased FC in the sensorimotor network.

In the current study, we used a measure of amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) to investigate the regional baseline brain function of this disorder. Fifty-four medication-naive PTSD patients and seventy-two matched traumatized comparison subjects who experienced the Sichuan major earthquake participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. We analyzed the difference between the PTSD and comparison groups during a resting state using ALFF. PTSD patients showed decreased ALFF values in right lingual gyrus, cuneus, middle occipital gyrus, insula, and cerebellum, and increased ALFF values in right medial and middle frontal gyri, relative to traumatized individuals without PTSD. The ALFF value in the right medial frontal gyrus was positively correlated with severity of the disorder. Our findings show that abnormality of intrinsic brain activity exists under resting conditions in PTSD patients exposed to a major earthquake. Altered ALFF in predominantly right hemisphere cortical and subcortical regions and in cerebellum potentially contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying traumatic memory and symptoms in PTSD.",

We used resting state FC-MRI to investigate the effects induced by chronic epilepsy on the connectivity of the language-related brain regions and correlated it with language performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FC-MRI was evaluated in 22 right-handed patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (11 with LE and 11 with RE) and in 12 healthy volunteers. Neuropsychological assessment of verbal IQ was performed. Patients and controls underwent BOLD fMRI with a verb-generation task, and language function was lateralized by an LI. Intrinsic activity fluctuations for FC analysis were extracted from data collected during the task. Six seeding cortical regions for speech in both hemispheres were selected to obtain a measure of the connectivity pattern among the language networks. RESULTS: Patients with LE presented atypical language lateralization and an overall reduced connectivity of the language network with respect to controls. In patients with both LE and RE, the mean FC was significantly reduced within the left (dominant) hemisphere and between the 2 hemispheres. In patients with LE, there was a positive correlation between verbal IQ scores and the left intrahemispheric FC. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with intractable epilepsy, FC-MRI revealed an overall reduction and reorganization of the connectivity pattern within the language network. FC was reduced in the left hemisphere regardless of the epileptogenic focus side and was positively correlated with linguistic performance only in patients with LE.",

Also, a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) was used to characterize patterns of functional coactivations involving NAcc: The results of a structure-based meta-analyses of 57 fMRI and PET studies were submitted to activation likelihood estimation analysis to estimate consistent activation patterns across the different imaging studies. The results of the combined rsFC and MACM analyses show that spontaneous activity in NAcc predicts activity in regions implicated in reward circuitries, including orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, amygdala, and insula. This confirms the key role of NAcc in the mesocorticolimbic system, which integrates inputs from limbic and cortical regions. We also detected activity in brain regions having few or no direct anatomical connections with NAcc, such as sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum, medial and posterior parietal cortex, and medial/inferior temporal cortex, supporting the view that not all functional connections can be explained by anatomical connections but can also result from connections mediated by third areas. Our rsFC findings are in line with the results of the structure-based meta-analysis: MACM maps are superimposable with NAcc rsFC results, and the reward paradigm class is the one that most frequently generates activation in NAcc. Our results overlap considerably with recently proposed schemata of the main neuron systems in the limbic forebrain and in the anterior part of the limbic midbrain in rodents and nonhuman primates.",

METHODS: Resting state (RS) functional MRI and DT MRI data were acquired from 33 patients with SPMS, 24 patients with PPMS, and 24 controls. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify the DMN. SPM5 was used to assess within- and between-group activations. RESULTS: Between-group differences in DMN activity were found in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), left precentral gyrus (PcG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Compared to controls, patients with SPMS had reduced activity in the mPFC (p = 0.01) and PcG (p = 0.02), while patients with PPMS had reduced activity in the PcG (p = 0.008) and the ACC (p = 0.002). Compared to patients with PPMS, patients with SPMS had increased ACC activity (p = 0.04). Reduction of RS activity in the ACC was more pronounced in cognitively impaired vs cognitively preserved patients with MS (p = 0.02). In patients with MS, DMN abnormalities correlated with the PASAT and word list test scores (r values ranging from 0.35 to 0.45) and DT MRI changes in the corpus callosum and the cingulum (r values ranging from 0.82 to 0.87). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a dysfunction of the anterior components of the default-mode network may be among the factors responsible for the accumulation of cognitive deficits in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis.",

A correction for variance from vascularization effects can thus lead to an improved group statistics by reducing inter-subject variability. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) as determined in a resting-state scan has been shown to be dependent on vascularization. Here we present a correction method termed RESCALE (REsting-state based SCALing of parameter Estimates) that uses local information to compute a voxel-wise scaling factor based on the correlation structure of fALFF and task activation parameter estimates from within a cube of 3×3×3 surrounding that voxel. The scaling method was used on a visuo-motor paradigm and resulted in a consistent increase in t-values in all task-activated cortical regions, with increases in peak t-values of 37.0\% in the visual cortex and 12.7\% in the left motor cortex.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Functional acupoint specificity is crucial to the clinical efficacy of acupuncture treatment, such as pain relief. Whether acupuncture needling at a peripheral acupoint produces distinct patterns of brain responses remains controversial.RESULTS: This fMRI study employed the complex network analysis (CNA) to test the hypothesis that acupuncture stimulation at an acupoint correspondingly induced activity changes in one or more intrinsic or resting-state brain networks. Built upon the sustained effect of acupuncture and its time-varying characteristics, we constructed a dynamic encoding system with the hub anchored at the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/pC). We found that needling at two visual acupoints (GB37 and BL60) and a non-visual acupoint (KI8) induced a spatially converging brain response, which overlapped at the PCC/pC. We also found distinct neural modulations during and after acupoint stimulation. During this period, the PCC/pC interacted with a visual resting-state network in different patterns. Furthermore, there was a delayed functional correspondence between the intrinsic visual network and manipulation over the visual acupoints (i.e., GB37 or BL60), but not the non-visual acupoint (KI8) via the PCC/pC, implicating a specific temporal-spatial encoding/decoding mechanism underlying the post-effect of acupuncture.CONCLUSIONS: This study provided an integrated view exploring the functional specificity of acupuncture in which both the needling sensation and the following neural cascades may contribute to the overall effect of acupuncture through dynamic reconfiguration of complex neural networks.fMRI, acupoints, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, temporal-spatial encoding, resting-state networks.",

Furthermore, recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have also shown that low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFF) of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were abnormal in several brain areas of AD patients. However, few studies have investigated disturbed LFF connectivity in AD patients. By using resting-state fMRI, this study sought to investigate the abnormal functional connectivities throughout the entire brain of early AD patients, and analyze the global distribution of these abnormalities. For this purpose, the authors divided the whole brain into 116 regions and identified abnormal connectivities by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair. Compared with healthy controls, AD patients had decreased positive correlations between the prefrontal and parietal lobes, but increased positive correlations within the prefrontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. The AD patients also had decreased negative correlations (closer to zero) between two intrinsically anti-correlated networks that had previously been found in the resting brain. By using resting-state fMRI, our results supported previous studies that have reported an anterior-posterior disconnection phenomenon and increased within-lobe functional connectivity in AD patients. In addition, the results also suggest that AD may disturb the correlation/anti-correlation effect in the two intrinsically anti-correlated networks.",

    title = "{Functional connectivity in mild traumatic brain injury.}",
    abstract = "Objectives: Research suggests that the majority of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients exhibit both cognitive and emotional dysfunction within the first weeks of injury, followed by symptom resolution 3-6 months postinjury. The neuronal correlates of said dysfunction are difficult to detect with standard clinical neuroimaging, complicating differential diagnosis and early identification of patients who may not recover. This study examined whether resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides objective markers of injury and predicts cognitive, emotional, and somatic complaints in mTBI patients semiacutely (<3 weeks postinjury) and in late recovery (3-5 month) phases. Methods: Twenty-seven semiacute mTBI patients and 26 gender, age, and education-matched controls were studied. Fifteen of 27 patients returned for a follow-up visit 3-5 months postinjury. The main dependent variables were spontaneous fluctuations (temporal correlation) in the default-mode (DMN) and fronto-parietal task-related networks as measured by fMRI. Results: Significant differences in self-reported cognitive, emotional, and somatic complaints were observed (all P < 0.05), despite normal clinical (T1 and T2) imaging and neuropsychological testing results. Mild TBI patients demonstrated decreased functional connectivity within the DMN and hyper-connectivity between the DMN and lateral prefrontal cortex. Measures of functional connectivity exhibited high levels of sensitivity and specificity for patient classification and predicted cognitive complaints in the semi-acute injury stage. However, no changes in functional connectivity were observed across a 4-month recovery period. Conclusions: Abnormal connectivity between the DMN and frontal cortex may provide objective biomarkers of mTBI and underlie cognitive impairment. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Resting-state baseline fluctuations were evaluated in 12 children anesthetized with thiopental. Five subjects had fluctuations related to subvoxel motion. In seven subjects without significant motion, slow signal fluctuation at 0.025-0.041 Hz near one or more primary sensory cortices was observed. In each subject the amplitude and frequency of the fluctuations were stable. It is hypothesized that thiopental, which reduces blood pressure and flow in the cortex, alters the feedback in neurovascular coupling leading to an increase in the magnitude and a reduction in the frequency of these fluctuations. The use of anesthesia in fMRI may provide new insight into neural connectivity and the coupling of blood flow and neural metabolism.",

    abstract = "Despite its potential advantages for fMRI analysis, fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering suffers from limitations such as the need for a priori knowledge of the number of clusters, and unknown statistical significance and instability of the results. We propose a randomization-based method to control the false-positive rate and estimate statistical significance of the FCM results. Using this novel approach, we develop an fMRI activation detection method. The ability of the method in controlling the false-positive rate is shown by analysis of false positives in activation maps of resting-state fMRI data. Controlling the false-positive rate in FCM allows comparison of different fuzzy clustering methods, using different feature spaces, to other fMRI detection methods. In this article, using simulation and real fMRI data, we compare a novel feature space that takes the variability of the hemodynamic response function into account (HRF-based feature space) to the conventional cross-correlation analysis and FCM using the cross-correlation feature space. In both cases, the HRF-based feature space provides a greater sensitivity compared to the cross-correlation feature space and conventional cross-correlation analysis. Application of the proposed method to finger-tapping fMRI data, using HRF-based feature space, detected activation in sub-cortical regions, whereas both of the FCM with cross-correlation feature space and the conventional cross-correlation method failed to detect them.",

Here we directly test the behavioral relevance of the resting-state correlation between two face-selective regions in human brain, the occipital face area (OFA) and the fusiform face area (FFA). We found that the magnitude of the resting-state correlation, henceforth called functional connectivity (FC), between OFA and FFA correlates with an individual's performance on a number of face-processing tasks, not non-face tasks. Further, we found that the behavioral significance of the OFA/FFA FC is independent of the functional activation and the anatomical size of either the OFA or FFA, suggesting that face processing depends not only on the functionality of individual face-selective regions, but also on the synchronized spontaneous neural activity between them. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the functional correlations in the BOLD response observed at rest reveal functionally significant properties of cortical processing.",

Specifically, we hypothesized that working memory-related functional connectivity at pre-treatment can predict improvement of negative symptoms in antipsychotic-treated patients. Fourteen antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia were clinically assessed before and after 7 months of quetiapine monotherapy. At baseline, patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a verbal n-back task. Spatial independent component analysis identified task-modulated brain networks. A linear support vector machine was trained with these components to discriminate six patients who showed improvement in negative symptoms from eight non-improvers. Classification accuracy and significance was estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation and permutation tests, respectively. Two frontoparietal and one default mode network components predicted negative symptom improvement with a classification accuracy of 79\% (p = 0.003). Discriminating features were found in the frontoparietal networks but not the default mode network. These preliminary data suggest that functional patterns at baseline can predict negative symptom treatment-response in schizophrenia.

Functional imaging studies in major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate abnormal resting state neural activity and negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses (NBRs) in regions of the default-mode network (DMN). Methods. Since activity in DMN regions has been associated with self-relatedness, we investigated neural activity in these regions during self-related emotional judgement and passive picture viewing in 25 patients with MDD and 25 healthy controls in an event-related fMRI design. Results. Behaviourally, MDD subjects showed significantly higher ratings of self-relatedness that also correlated with depression symptoms such as hopelessness. Neuroimaging results in MDD patients showed significantly lower negative BOLD responses (NBRs) in anterior medial cortical regions during judgement of self-relatedness while posterior medial regions showed increased NBRs. Unlike in healthy subjects, the anterior medial cortical NBRs were no longer parametrically modulated by the degree of self-relatedness in MDD patients. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that reduced NBRs in the anterior regions of the default-mode network may signify decoupling from self-relatedness in MDD patients with the consecutive abnormal increase of self-focus.",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: The subcortical region such as thalamus was believed to have close relationship with many cerebral cortexes which made it especially interesting in the study of functional connectivity. Here, we used resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in thalamus connectivity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which presented a neuro-disconnection syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 14 patients and 14 healthy age-matched controls were analyzed. Thalamus connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the thalamus and those in all other brain regions. RESULTS: We found that functional connectivity between the left thalamus and a set of regions was decreased in MCI; these regions are: bilateral cuneus, middle occipital gyrus (MOG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and precentral gyrus (PreCG). There are also some regions showed reduced connectivity to right thalamus; these regions are bilateral cuneus, MOG, fusiform gyrus (FG), MPFC, paracentral lobe (PCL), precuneus, superior parietal lobe (SPL) and IFG. We also found increased functional connectivity between the left thalamus and the right thalamus in MCI. CONCLUSION: The decreased connectivity between the thalamus and the other brain regions might indicate reduced integrity of thalamus-related cortical networks in MCI. Furthermore, the increased connectivity between the left and right thalamus suggest compensation for the loss of cognitive function. Briefly, impairment and compensation of thalamus connectivity coexist in the MCI patients",

METHODS: Region of interest-based correlation analyses were performed in the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to examine differences in functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus between medication-na\"{\i}ve patients with MDD and healthy adults. Correlation analyses were done between clinical variables and the strength of FC in regions showing group differences. RESULTS: Positive FC with the hippocampal-ROIs was seen in bilateral limbic system, subcortical areas, temporal lobe, medial and inferior prefrontal cortex while negative FC was observed in bilateral prefrontal cortex, parietal and occipital cortex and the cerebellum. Group comparison showed impaired functional connections of the hippocampus in MDD, with a lack of negative FC in left hippocampal-ROI to bilateral middle frontal gyrus, as well as decreased negative FC in right hippocampal-ROI to right inferior parietal cortex and the cerebellum. Negative correlations were seen between illness duration and the strength of FC in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. LIMITATIONS: An optimized method taking individual variability of hippocampal volume into account is merited for the definition of seed regions and computation of FC. Further studies recruiting subjects with subthreshold depressive symptoms are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal functional relationships between the hippocampus and cortical areas may underlie the pathophysiology of MDD},

This study investigates how an increase in blood CO(2), via inhalation of 5\% CO(2), may alter brain activity in humans. Dynamic measurement of brain metabolism revealed that mild hypercapnia resulted in a suppression of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) by 13.4\% ± 2.3\% (N=14) and, furthermore, the CMRO(2) change was proportional to the subject's end-tidal CO(2) (Et-CO(2)) change. When using functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to assess the changes in resting-state neural activity, it was found that hypercapnia resulted in a reduction in all fcMRI indices assessed including cluster volume, cross-correlation coefficient, and amplitude of the fcMRI signal in the default-mode network (DMN). The extent of the reduction was more pronounced than similar indices obtained in visual-evoked fMRI, suggesting a selective suppression effect on resting-state neural activity. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) studies comparing hypercapnia with normocapnia conditions showed a relative increase in low frequency power in the EEG spectra, suggesting that the brain is entering a low arousal state on CO(2) inhalation.",

Recent evidence suggests that bilateral tDCS over both primary sensorimotor cortices (SM1) yields more prominent effects on motor performance in both healthy subjects and chronic stroke patients than unilateral tDCS over SM1. To better characterize the underlying neural mechanisms of this effect, we aimed to explore changes in resting-state functional connectivity during both stimulation types. In a randomized single-blinded cross-over design, 12 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest before, during and after 20 minutes of uni-, bilateral tDCS and sham stimulation over SM1. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) was used to investigate tDCS-induced changes in functional connectivity patterns across the whole brain. Uni- and bilateral tDCS over SM1 resulted in functional connectivity changes in widespread brain areas as compared to sham both during and after stimulation. Whereas bilateral tDCS predominantly modulated changes in primary and secondary motor as well as prefrontal regions, unilateral tDCS affected prefrontal, parietal and cerebellar areas. No direct effect was seen under the stimulating electrode in the unilateral condition. The time course of changes in functional connectivity in the respective brain areas was non-linear and temporally dispersed.

The therapeutic course for them all was one month. Resting fMRI scanning was performed before and after treatment using 3.0 T magnetic resonance. Data were analyzed using fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). Paired t-test was used for comparison. Correlation analysis was performed in the fALFF images after treatment and Hamilton's depression scale.RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, fALFF values in the left frontal lobe (BA6, BA9, BA48), the right frontal lobe (BA4, BA46), the bilateral inferior parietal lobules (BA40, BA48), the precuneus (BA7), the posterior cingutate (BA31), the left occipital lobe (BA17), and the right occipital lobe (BA18) of the needling +fluoxetine group were lowered (P<0.05). fALFF values in the right inferior parietal lobule (BA40) and the right occipital lobe (BA17) of the fluoxetine group were lowered (P<0.05). fALFF values in the left frontal lobe (BA10), the right frontal lobe (BA45), the left occipital lobe (BA19), the right occipital lobe (BA17), the left precuneus (BA7), and the posterior cingutate (BA31) were lowered in the needling group (P<0.05). Hamilton's depression scale was positively correlated with the fALFF value in the left frontal lobe of the needling +fluoxetine group and the needling group, while Hamilton's depression scale was positively correlated with the fALFF value in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe in the fluoxetine group.CONCLUSIONS: Combination of needling and antidepressive agents was superior to needling or antidepressive agents alone. Changes of the frontal lobe functions were correlated with the severity of depression. More extensive correlation existed between the liver meridian and the frontal lobe, which might be the antidepressive mechanism of needling Taichong (LV3).",

    title = "{Resting-State Networks In Schizophrenia.}",
    abstract = "Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a disorder of altered brain connectivity (i.e. dysconnectivity). Until relatively recently, it was not feasible to test dysconnectivity hypotheses of schizophrenia in vivo. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)is a powerful tool for mapping functional networks of the brain, such as the default mode network (DMN), and investigating the systems-level pathology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this article, we review the latest findings from resting-state fMRI studies on schizophrenia. Despite the wide array of methods used and heterogeneity of patient samples, several tentative conclusions may be drawn from the existing literature. 1) Connectivity of theDMN is altered in schizophrenia. Findings vary across studies; however, a majority of investigations reported hyper-connectivity of the DMN. 2)Resting-state connectivity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is reduced in schizophrenia, particularly intra-PFC connectivity. 3)Cortical-subcortical networks, including thalamocortical, fronto-limbic, and cortico-cerebellar networks are altered in schizophrenia.4) Preliminary findings indicate that functional connectivity within auditory/language networks and the basal ganglia is related to specific clinical symptoms, including auditory-verbal hallucinations and delusions. 5)Whole-brain network topology measures based on graph theoryindicate that functional brain networks in schizophrenia are characterized by reduced small-worldness, lower degree connectivity of brain hubs, and decreased modularity.6) Some of the alterations in functional connectivity observed in probandsare present in unaffected relatives,raising the possibility that functional dysconnectivity is an endophenotype related to genetic risk for schizophrenia.Combined, these findings provide broad support for dysconnectivity theoriesof schizophrenia. We conclude our review with a discussion of the limitations of the existing literature and potentially important areas of future research",

    abstract = "To address the extent to which functional connectivity measures an absolute brain state, we observed the effect of prior performance of a language task on resting-state networks in regions associated with language. Six subjects were imaged during rest before and after a block-design language task. Connectivity maps were generated for each of four language regions (identified from analysis of the language activation portion of the study) in each subject for both rest periods. Conjunction analysis demonstrated distinct networks of voxels for each seed region, indicating separate functional subnetworks associated with the different regions. In a comparison of rest before and after the activation task widespread and significant changes were observed in all individuals, suggesting that the measured resting state network reflects a dynamic image of the current brain state. At the group level, an extended network was observed that was largely persistent over time. Even at the group level an increase in connectivity was observed between left and right middle frontal gyri, and between posterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal cortex in the rest after the language task. These results suggest that functional connectivity may be a powerful measure of cognitive state, sensitive to differences between controls and patients together with the particular cognitive processing occurring during the rest state",

Brain resting-state activity, inner experience, and cognitive ability measurements were obtained in 70 participants aged 19-80 years. The anterior-posterior disruption of DMN activity with age reported in previous studies was recovered here. A significant effect of age was also found on cognitive abilities but not on inner experience. Finally, age-related changes in DMN connectivity were found to correlate with cognitive abilities, and more specifically with autobiographical memory performance. These findings provide new information to fuel the debate on the role of the brain default mode and more specifically on the effect of age-related changes in resting-state activity as measured with fMRI",

    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Independent component analysis (ICA) has proven its applicability in both standard and resting-state fMRI. While there is consensus on single-subject ICA methodology, the extension to group ICA is more complex and a number of approaches have been suggested. Currently, two software packages are most frequently used for ICA group analysis: (1) GIFT introduced by Calhoun et al., and (2) PICA, proposed by Beckmann et al.. Both methods are based on the assumption of statistical independence of the extracted component maps ("spatial ICA"). Group maps are estimated via ICA on pre-calculated group data sets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we applied the two analysis approaches to a group of fMRI resting-state data sets obtained from twenty-eight healthy subjects. Default implementations were used and the number of components was restricted to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. The performance of GIFT and PICA was assessed with respect to the number of resting-state networks detected at different component estimation levels and computational load. RESULTS: At low component estimation levels GIFT analysis resulted in more RSNs than PICA, while for individually determined component levels both approaches obtained the same RSNs. Although component maps show some variability across the two methods, spatial and temporal comparison using correlation coefficients resulted in no significant differences between the RSNs detected across the different analyses CONCLUSION: Our results show that both approaches provide an adequate way of group ICA obtaining a comparable number of RSNs differing mainly in calculation times.},

    abstract = "Simultaneous acquisition of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) aims to disentangle the description of brain processes by exploiting the advantages of each technique. Most studies in this field focus on exploring the relationships between fMRI signals and the power spectrum at some specific frequency bands (alpha, beta, etc.). On the other hand, brain mapping of EEG signals (e.g., interictal spikes in epileptic patients) usually assumes an haemodynamic response function for a parametric analysis applying the GLM, as a rough approximation. The integration of the information provided by the high spatial resolution of MR images and the high temporal resolution of EEG may be improved by referencing them by transfer functions, which allows the identification of neural driven areas without strong assumptions about haemodynamic response shapes or brain haemodynamic's homogeneity. The difference on sampling rate is the first obstacle for a full integration of EEG and fMRI information. Moreover, a parametric specification of a function representing the commonalities of both signals is not established. In this study, we introduce a new data-driven method for estimating the transfer function from EEG signal to fMRI signal at EEG sampling rate. This approach avoids EEG subsampling to fMRI time resolution and naturally provides a test for EEG predictive power over BOLD signal fluctuations, in a well-established statistical framework. We illustrate this concept in resting state (eyes closed) and visual simultaneous fMRI-EEG experiments. The results point out that it is possible to predict the BOLD fluctuations in occipital cortex by using EEG measurements.",

    abstract = {BACKGROUND:Functional magnetic resonance imaging offers a compelling, new perspective on altered brain function but is sparsely used in studies of anesthetic effect. To examine effects on verbal memory encoding, the authors imaged human brain response to auditory word stimulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging at different concentrations of an agent not previously studied, and tested memory after recovery. METHODS:Six male volunteers were studied breathing 0.0, 2.0, and 1.0\% end-tidal sevoflurane (awake, deep, and light states, respectively) via laryngeal mask. In each condition, they heard 15 two-syllable English nouns via closed headphones. Each word was repeated 15 times (1/s), followed by 15 s of rest. Blood oxygenation level-dependent brain activations during blocks of stimulation versus rest were assessed with a 3-T Siemens Trio scanner and a 20-voxel spatial extent threshold. Memory was tested approximately 1.5 h after recovery with an auditory recognition task (chance performance = 33\% correct). RESULTS:Scans showed widespread activations (P < 0.005, uncorrected) in the awake state, including bilateral superior temporal, frontal, and parietal cortex, right occipital cortex, bilateral thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum; more limited activations in the light state (bilateral superior temporal gyrus, right thalamus, bilateral parietal cortex, left frontal cortex, and right occipital cortex); and no significant auditory-related activation in the deep state. During recognition testing, subjects correctly selected 77 +/- 12\% of words presented while they were awake as "old," versus 32 +/- 15 and 42 +/- 8\% (P < 0.01) correct for the light and deep stages, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Sevoflurane induces dose-dependent suppression of auditory blood oxygenation level-dependent signals, which likely limits the ability of words to be processed during anesthesia and compromises memory.},

Recent studies suggest the presence of a modulating effect of somatosensory inputs on the spinal dorsal horn. However, the effects of somatosensory inputs on cerebral processing and, in particular, on the functional and effective connectivity of the somatosensory brain network, are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the longitudinal impact of somatosensory stimuli on the resting-state functional connectivity and effective connectivity of the somatosensory brain network. We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 12 healthy subjects before and after unilateral electrical median nerve stimulation. We combined this analysis with a psychophysiological examination of changes of the perception threshold. We found that the unilateral median nerve stimulation increased the perception thresholds bilaterally and increased the resting-state functional and effective connectivity between most cortical areas of the somatosensory network. The major finding, however, was a decreased resting-state functional connectivity between both secondary somatosensory cortices and the bilateral medial nuclear complex of the thalamus. This decreased connectivity was correlated with increased perception thresholds. These findings emphasize the importance of the medial thalamic nucleus for the perceptual awareness of somatosensory stimuli. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

Seed regions were defined using the regions of maximal activation and deactivation during a language functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in a separate cohort of 30 controls.RESULTS: Language fMRI produced the expected activation pattern, which was not different between patients and controls. However, functional connectivity between language areas during rest was markedly different; whereas controls showed connectivity between each of the seed areas and the majority of the language areas, patients showed connectivity only with a few areas, particularly the seed area itself. This difference was significant in the direct comparison of patients and control connectivity maps.INTERPRETATION: We suggest that this reduced connectivity in left temporal lobe epilepsy may reflect a disturbance of the language network during resting state in patients and may be related to subtle language difficulties in this patient population.",

To address this issue, we simulate the signal change between activated and resting states as a function of blood volume fraction (lambda). From these results, the relative contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) from the resting to the activated state can be calculated as a function of resolution. We consider different vessel orientations and note that, in most cases, the most efficient scanning procedure is for low resolution imaging. To overcome this limitation, a T(1) enhancing contrast agent is proposed to increase the signal from the blood and, hence, the intravascular contribution to the BOLD effect. We show that this effect dramatically increases both the signal changes and the efficiency of high-resolution imaging and should lead to much better visualization and localization of parenchymal changes.",

Then weighted brain networks (in which nodes are brain components) were built based on correlations between ICA time courses. Clustering coefficients and connectivity strength of the networks were computed. A dynamic branch cutting algorithm was used to identify modules of the FNC in HCs and SZs. Results show stronger connectivity strength and higher clustering coefficient in HCs with more and smaller modules in SZs. In addition, HCs and SZs had some different hubs.

Previous studies of brain-state classification have focused largely on decoding brief, discrete events and have required the timing of these events to be known. To date, methods for decoding more continuous and purely subject-driven cognitive states have not been available. Here, we demonstrate that free-streaming subject-driven cognitive states can be decoded using a novel whole-brain functional connectivity analysis. Ninety functional regions of interest (ROIs) were defined across 14 large-scale resting-state brain networks to generate a 3960 cell matrix reflecting whole-brain connectivity. We trained a classifier to identify specific patterns of whole-brain connectivity as subjects rested quietly, remembered the events of their day, subtracted numbers, or (silently) sang lyrics. In a leave-one-out cross-validation, the classifier identified these 4 cognitive states with 84\% accuracy. More critically, the classifier achieved 85\% accuracy when identifying these states in a second, independent cohort of subjects. Classification accuracy remained high with imaging runs as short as 30-60 s. At all temporal intervals assessed, the 90 functionally defined ROIs outperformed a set of 112 commonly used structural ROIs in classifying cognitive states. This approach should enable decoding a myriad of subject-driven cognitive states from brief imaging data samples",

Using two sets of public R-fMRI TRT data, we systematically evaluated the ReHo's TRT reliability and further investigated the various factors influencing its reliability and found: 1) nuisance (head motion, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid) correction of R-fMRI timeseries can significantly improve the TRT reliability of ReHo while additional removal of global brain signal reduces its reliability, 2) Spatial smoothing of R-fMRI timeseries artificially enhances ReHo intensity and influences its reliability, 3) surface-based R-fMRI computation largely improves the TRT reliability of ReHo, 4) a scan duration of 5minutes can achieve reliableestimates of ReHo, and 5) fast sampling rates of R-fMRI dramatically increase the reliability of ReHo. Inspired by these findings and seeking a highly reliable approach to exploratory analysis of the human functional connectome, we established an R-fMRI pipeline to conduct ReHo computations in both 3-dimensions (volume) and 2-dimensions (surface)",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in cognitive abilities such as verbal fluency and in cognitive-related brain regions, particularly Broca's area, have been reported in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that structural and functional abnormalities in Broca's area were associated with clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that deficits in this area may reflect the core pathology of schizophrenia. Thus, it is important to understand how the structural volume and functional connectivity in this area changes at rest according to the course of the illness.METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the structural volume of Broca's area as a region of interest in 16 schizophrenia, 16 ultra-high risk (UHR), and 23 healthy matched controls. We also assessed verbal fluency and analyzed differences across groups in the functional connectivity patterns using resting-state functional MRI. The UHR group showed significantly reduced structural volume in Broca's area and significantly reduced functional connectivity between Broca's area and the lateral and medial frontal cortex as well as decreased cognitive performance. Altered functional connectivity in patients was correlated with their positive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest the existence of functional disconnections in Broca's area, even during resting-states, among those with schizophrenia as well as those at UHR for this disorder. These alterations may contribute to their clinical symptoms, suggesting that this is one of the key regions involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia",

Connectivity is a distinctive feature of the brain and the integrity of functional network dynamics is crucial for normal functioning. A better understanding of network disruption in the neurodegenerative dementias might help bridge the gap between molecular changes, pathological changes, and symptoms. Recent findings on functional network disruption as assessed with resting-state or intrinsic connectivity functional MRI and electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography have shown distinct patterns of network disruption across the major neurodegenerative diseases. These network abnormalities are somewhat specific to the clinical syndromes and, in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, network disruption tracks the pattern of pathological changes. These findings might have practical implications for diagnostic accuracy, allowing earlier detection of neurodegenerative diseases even at the presymptomatic stage, and tracking of disease progression.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and those with treatment-sensitive depression (TSD) responded to antidepressants differently. Previous studies have commonly shown that patients with TRD or TSD had abnormal neural activity in different brain regions. In the present study, we used a coherence-based ReHo (Cohe-ReHo) approach to test the hypothesis that patients with TRD or TSD had abnormal neural activity in different brain regions. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with TRD, 22 with TSD, and 19 healthy subjects (HS) matched with gender, age, and education level participated in the study. RESULTS: ANOVA analysis revealed widespread differences in Cohe-ReHo values among the three groups in different brain regions which included bilateral superior frontal gyrus, bilateral cerebellum, left inferior temporal gyrus, left occipital cortex, and both sides of fusiform gyrus. Compared to HS, lower Cohe-ReHo values were observed in TRD group in bilateral superior frontal gyrus and left cerebellum; in contrast, in TSD group, lower Cohe-ReHo values were mainly found in bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Compared to TSD group, TRD group had lower Cohe-ReHo in bilateral cerebellum and higher Cohe-ReHo in left fusiform gyrus. There was a negative correlation between Cohe-ReHo values of the left fusiform gyrus and illness duration in the pooled patients (r = 0.480, p = 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of cerebellar Cohe-ReHo values differentiating TRD from TSD were 83\% and 86\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to healthy controls, both TRD and TSD patients shared the majority of brain regions with abnormal neural activity. However, the lower Cohe-ReHo values in the cerebellum might be as a marker to differentiate TRD from TSD with high sensitivity and specificity",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we develop a dynamic functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis approach using correlations between windowed time-courses of different brain networks (components) estimated via spatial independent component analysis (sICA). We apply the developed method to fMRI data to evaluate it and to study task-modulation of functional connections.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We study the theoretical basis of the approach, perform a simulation analysis and apply it to fMRI data from schizophrenia patients (SP) and healthy controls (HC). Analyses on the fMRI data include: (a) group sICA to determine regions of significant task-related activity, (b) static and dynamic FNC analysis among these networks by using maximal lagged-correlation and time-frequency analysis, and (c) HC-SP group differences in functional network connections and in task-modulation of these connections.RESULTS: This new approach enables an assessment of task-modulation of connectivity and identifies meaningful inter-component linkages and differences between the two study groups during performance of an auditory oddball task (AOT). The static FNC results revealed that connectivities involving medial visual-frontal, medial temporal-medial visual, parietal-medial temporal, parietal-medial visual and medial temporal-anterior temporal were significantly greater in HC, whereas only the right lateral fronto-parietal (RLFP)-orbitofrontal connection was significantly greater in SP. The dynamic FNC revealed that task-modulation of motor-frontal, RLFP-medial temporal and posterior default mode (pDM)-parietal connections were significantly greater in SP, and task modulation of orbitofrontal-pDM and medial temporal-frontal connections were significantly greater in HC (all P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: The task-modulation of dynamic FNC provided findings and differences between the two groups that are consistent with the existing hypothesis that schizophrenia patients show less segregated motor, sensory, cognitive functions and less segregated default mode network activity when engaged with a task. Dynamic FNC, based on sICA, provided additional results which are different than, but complementary to, those of static FNC. For example, it revealed dynamic changes in default mode network connectivities with other regions which were significantly different in schizophrenia in terms of task-modulation, findings which were not possible to discover by static FNC",

Vector field phases exhibit a transition with neuronal activation from random-like orientations during rest to clusters of common orientations. Cluster size is shown to be weakly dependent on the radii of the vector field calculation, and shuffling voxel position within clusters generates a random-like vector orientation instead.

Experimental design: Ten (10) healthy adults participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (i.e., nuclear medicine; fMRI) study. During the brain-imaging procedure, the participants were instructed to lie quietly; they did not perform any cognitive task. Main outcome measures: Three (3) fMRI scans were conducted for each participant: a first resting-state scan (R1), a stimulating-acupoint scan (AP), and a second resting-state scan (R2) after AP. Individual fALFF maps were calculated for each scan. Results: During R1, consistent with previous studies, the default network regions showed significantly detectable fALFF amplitudes. Acupuncture on PC6 increased fALFF amplitudes within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), occipital fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus (PCC/PCU). In contrast, during R2, fALFF within PCC is still significantly higher than R1 while ACC and cerebellum showed decreased fALFF. Conclusions: These findings imply that stimulating PC6 can change the amplitude of the intrinsic cortical activity of the brain. In particular, a continuous and temporally consistent effect of acupuncture within PCC not the common brain circuit of pain including ACC and cerebellum was observed. Considering the cognitive functions and deficits of the relevant areas in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease, acupuncture on PC6 could potentially affect both psychiatric and neurological disorders. Thus, stimulating PC6 may be a candidate method for improving cognitive impairment",

Integrity of distributed functional connectivity networks incorporating six hippocampal subregions (i.e. cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus and subicular complex, bilaterally) was then explored over time and comparisons made between groups. The ability of these extent longitudinal changes to separate unrelated groups of 30 subjects (aMCI-converters, n = 6; aMCI group-2, n = 12; controls group-2, n = 12) were further assessed. Six longitudinal hippocampus subregional functional connectivity networks showed similar changes in aMCI subjects over time, which were mainly associated with medial frontal gyrus, lateral temporal cortex, insula, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and cerebellum. However, the disconnection of hippocampal subregions and PCC may be a key factor of impaired episodic memory in aMCI, and the functional index of these longitudinal changes allowed well classifying independent samples of aMCI converters from non-converters (sensitivity was 83.3\%, specificity was 83.3\%) and controls (sensitivity was 83.3\%, specificity was 91.7\%).CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It demonstrated that the functional changes in resting-state hippocampus subregional networks could be an important and early indicator for dysfunction that may be particularly relevant to early stage changes and progression of aMCI subjects",

While several studies have investigated reliability of task-induced motor network activation, less is known about the reliability of the task-free motor network. Here, we investigate the reproducibility of task-free fMRI, and compare it to motor task activity. Sixteen healthy subjects participated in this study with a test-retest interval of seven weeks. The task-free motor network was assessed with a univariate, seed-voxel-based correlation analysis. Reproducibility was tested by means of intraclass correlation (ICC) values and ratio of overlap. Higher ICC values and a better overlap were found for task fMRI as compared to task-free fMRI. Furthermore, ratio of overlap improved for task fMRI at higher thresholds, while it decreased for task-free fMRI, suggesting a less focal spatial pattern of the motor network during resting state. However, for both techniques the most active voxels were located in the primary motor cortex. This indicates that, just like task fMRI, task-free fMRI can properly identify critical brain areas for motor task performance. Although both fMRI techniques are able to detect the motor network, resting-state fMRI is less reliable than task fMRI. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

However, the underlying mechanism of this connectivity is still poorly understood, with the synchronized fluctuations could either originate from hemodynamic oscillations or represent true neuronal signaling. To better interpret the resting signal, in the current work, we examined spontaneous fluctuations at the level of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygenation (CMRO2), an index reflecting regional oxygen consumption and metabolism, and thus less sensitive to vascular dynamics. The CMRO2 signal was obtained based on a biophysical model with data acquired from simultaneous blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and perfusion signals. CMRO2-based functional connectivity maps were generated in three brain networks: visual, default-mode, and hippocampus. Experiments were performed on twelve healthy participants during 'resting state' and as a comparison, with a visual task. CMRO2 signals in each of the above mentioned brain networks showed significant correlations. Functional connectivity maps from the CMRO2 signal are, in general, similar to those from BOLD and perfusion. In addition, we demonstrated that the three parameters (M, alpha and beta) in the biophysical model for calculating CMRO2 have negligible effects on the determination of the CMRO2-based connectivity strength. This study provides evidence that the spontaneous fluctuations in fMRI at rest likely originate from dynamic changes of cerebral metabolism reflecting neuronal activity.",

Furthermore, the strength of these anticorrelations appears to be related to cognitive function. However, studies examining anticorrelations have typically employed global regression or similar analysis steps that force anticorrelated relationships to exist between brain areas. Therefore the validity of these findings has been questioned. Here we examine anticorrelations between a task-negative region in the medial frontal gyrus/anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a classic task-positive area, using an analysis that does not include global regression. Instead, we control for whole-brain correlations in the group-level analysis. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the strength of the functional connection between the medial frontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is related to cognitive function and that this relationship is not an artifact of global regression",

These patterns are known as resting state networks (RSNs) and emerge as low-frequency fluctuations (<0.1Hz) observed in the fMRI signal of human subjects during rest. We are interested in the relationship between structural connectivity of the cortex and the fluctuations exhibited during resting conditions. We are especially interested in the effect of degree of connectivity on resting state dynamics as the default mode network (DMN) is highly connected. We find in experimental resting fMRI data that the DMN is the functional network that is most frequently active and for the longest time. In large-scale computational simulations of the cortex based on the corresponding underlying DTI/DSI based neuroanatomical connectivity matrix, we additionally find a strong correlation between the mean degree of functional networks and the proportion of time they are active. By artificially modifying different types of neuroanatomical connectivity matrices in the model, we were able to demonstrate that only models based on structural connectivity containing hubs give rise to this relationship. We conclude that, during rest, the cortex alternates efficiently between explorations of its externally oriented functional repertoire and internally oriented processing as a consequence of the DMN's high degree of connectivity",

    abstract = "The human brain is a large-scale integrated network in the functional and structural domain. Graph theoretical analysis provides a novel framework for analysing such complex networks. While previous neuroimaging studies have uncovered abnormalities in several specific brain networks in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by tonic-clonic seizures, little is known about changes in whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. Regarding functional and structural connectivity, networks are intimately related and share common small-world topological features. We predict that patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy would exhibit a decoupling between functional and structural networks. In this study, 26 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy characterized by tonic-clonic seizures and 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal correlations and diffusion tensor image tractography were used to generate functional and structural connectivity networks. Graph theoretical analysis revealed that the patients lost optimal topological organization in both functional and structural connectivity networks. Moreover, the patients showed significant increases in nodal topological characteristics in several cortical and subcortical regions, including mesial frontal cortex, putamen, thalamus and amygdala relative to controls, supporting the hypothesis that regions playing important roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy may display abnormal hub properties in network analysis. Relative to controls, patients showed further decreases in nodal topological characteristics in areas of the default mode network, such as the posterior cingulate gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. Most importantly, the degree of coupling between functional and structural connectivity networks was decreased, and exhibited a negative correlation with epilepsy duration in patients. Our findings suggest that the decoupling of functional and structural connectivity may reflect the progress of long-term impairment in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and may be used as a potential biomarker to detect subtle brain abnormalities in epilepsy. Overall, our results demonstrate for the first time that idiopathic generalized epilepsy is reflected in a disrupted topological organization in large-scale brain functional and structural networks, thus providing valuable information for better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures.",

    abstract = "The long-standing notion of schizophrenia as a disorder of connectivity is supported by emerging evidence from recent neuroimaging studies, suggesting impairments of both structural and functional connectivity in schizophrenia. However, investigations are generally restricted to supratentorial brain regions, thereby excluding the cerebellum. As increasing evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes to cognitive and affective processing, aberrant connectivity in schizophrenia may include cerebellar dysconnectivity. Moreover, as schizophrenia is highly heritable, unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients may exhibit similar connectivity profiles. The present study applies resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine cerebellar functional connectivity profiles, and the familial component of cerebellar connectivity profiles, in 62 schizophrenia patients and 67 siblings of schizophrenia patients. Compared to healthy control subjects, schizophrenia patients showed impaired functional connectivity between the cerebellum and several left-sided cerebral regions, including the hippocampus, thalamus, middle cingulate gyrus, triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and lingual gyrus (all p < 0.0025, whole-brain significant). Importantly, siblings of schizophrenia patients showed several similarities to patients in cerebellar functional connectivity, suggesting that cerebellar dysconnectivity in schizophrenia might be related to familial factors. In conclusion, our findings suggest that dysconnectivity in schizophrenia involves the cerebellum and that this defect may be related to the risk to develop the illness",

However, the independent roles that each of these brain changes play in mediating memory decline is not clear. Therefore, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure gray matter (GM) volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging-based functional connectivity among default mode network nodes in 76 cognitive normal older adults. We found that GM, WMH, and connectivity between left inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortex (MPF\_LIP) were independently associated with episodic memory performance. Within the group with GM volumes below the median, greater MPF\_LIP connectivity was associated with better memory performance, whereas this association was not present for individuals with GM volume above the median. These findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of brain-behavior relationships in cognitive aging. In addition, the relationship between resting state functional connectivity and memory performance, particularly amongst those individuals with more brain atrophy, strongly suggests compensation against the effects of neuronal injury",

The reviewed resting state networks were the DMN, left and right executive control, salience, sensorimotor, auditory, and visual networks. We highlight some methodological issues concerning resting state analyses in severely injured brains mainly in terms of hypothesis-driven seed-based correlation analysis and data-driven independent components analysis approaches. Finally, we attempt to contextualize our discussion within theoretical frameworks of conscious processes. We think that this "lesion" approach allows us to better determine the necessary conditions under which normal conscious cognition takes place. At the clinical level, we acknowledge the technical merits of the resting state paradigm. Indeed, fast and easy acquisitions are preferable to activation paradigms in clinical populations. Finally, we emphasize the need to validate the diagnostic and prognostic value of fMRI resting state measurements in non-communicating brain damaged patients},

In this work, we investigated the spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations during states of reduced consciousness such as drowsiness and sleep. For this purpose, we performed BOLD fMRI on normal subjects during varying levels of consciousness, from resting wakefulness to light (non-slow wave) sleep. Depth of sleep was determined based on concurrently acquired EEG data. During light sleep, significant increases in the fluctuation level of the BOLD signal were observed in several cortical areas, among which visual cortex was the most significant. Correlations among brain regions involved with the default-mode network persisted during light sleep. These results suggest that activity in areas such as the default-mode network and primary sensory cortex, as measured from BOLD fMRI fluctuations, does not require a level of consciousness typical of wakefulness",

Comparisons between schizophrenic patients and their unaffected siblings enable further understanding of illness susceptibility and pathophysiology. We examined the resting-state connectivity differences in the intrinsic networks between schizophrenic patients, their unaffected siblings, and healthy controls.METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were obtained from 25 individuals in each subject group. The posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were used as seed regions to identify the TNN and TPN through functional connectivity analysis. Interregional connectivity strengths were analyzed using overlapped intrinsic networks composed of regions common to all subject groups.RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients and their unaffected siblings showed increased connectivity in the TNN between the bilateral inferior temporal gyri. By contrast, schizophrenic patients alone demonstrated increased connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and left inferior temporal gyrus and between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and right lateral parietal cortex in the TNN. Schizophrenic patients exhibited increased connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus in the TPN relative to their unaffected siblings, though this trend only approached statistical significance in comparison to healthy controls.CONCLUSION: Resting-state hyperconnectivity of the intrinsic networks may disrupt network coordination and thereby contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Similar, though milder, hyperconnectivity of the TNN in unaffected siblings of schizophrenic patients may contribute to the identification of schizophrenia endophenotypes and ultimately to the determination of schizophrenia risk genes",

T1 volumes were obtained from each subject and postprocessed according to an optimised voxel based morphometry protocol. Resting state functional MRI data were also collected from the same individuals and analysed to produce connectivity maps after identification of the default mode network (DMN) by independent component analysis.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both AD and a-MCI patients showed a similar regional pattern of brain disconnection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. Conversely, the distribution of GM atrophy was significantly more restricted in a-MCI than in AD patients. Interestingly, the PCC showed reduced connectivity in a-MCI patients in the absence of GM atrophy, which was, in contrast, detectable at the stage of fully developed AD.CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that disconnection precedes GM atrophy in the PCC, which is a critical area of the DMN, and supports the hypothesis that GM atrophy in specific regions of AD brains likely reflects a long term effect of brain disconnection. In this context, our study indicates that GM atrophy in PCC accompanies the conversion from MCI to AD.",

The default mode network was interrogated by means of decreases in brain activity, termed deactivations, during a visual encoding task and during a nonspatial working memory task. Deactivation was found in the default mode network involving the anterior frontal, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. MCI patients showed less deactivation than HC, but more than AD. The most pronounced differences between MCI, HC, and AD occurred in the very early phase of deactivation, reflecting the reactivity and adaptation of the network. The default mode network response in the anterior frontal cortex significantly distinguished MCI from both HC (in the medial frontal) and AD (in the anterior cingulate cortex). The response in the precuneus could only distinguish between patients and HC, not between MCI and AD. These findings may be consistent with the notion that MCI is a transitional state between healthy aging and dementia and with the proposed early changes in MCI in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus.

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A major impediment toward the development of novel treatment strategies for fibromyalgia (FM) is the lack of an objective marker which tracks with spontaneous clinical pain report. Resting state intrinsic brain connectivity in FM has demonstrated increased insular connectivity to the default mode network (DMN), a network whose activity is increased during rest. Moreover increased insular connectivity to the DMN was associated with increased spontaneous pain levels. However as these analyses were cross-sectional in nature, they provided no insight to dynamic changes in connectivity and their relationship with variation in clinical pain report. METHODS: 17 FM patients underwent resting state fMRI at baseline and following 4 weeks of a non-pharmacological intervention to diminish pain. Intrinsic DMN connectivity was evaluated using probabilistic independent component analysis. A paired analysis evaluated longitudinal changes in intrinsic DMN connectivity and a multiple linear regression investigated correlations between longitudinal changes in clinical pain and changes in intrinsic DMN connectivity. Changes in clinical pain were assessed with the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). RESULTS: Clinical pain was reduced following therapy (SF-MPQ sensory scale: p<0.02). Intrinsic DMN connectivity to the insula was reduced, and this reduction was correlated with reductions in pain (corrected p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that intrinsic brain connectivity can be used as a candidate objective marker that tracks intra-subject with changes in spontaneous chronic pain in FM. We propose that intrinsic connectivity measures could potentially be used either in research or clinical settings as a complementary, more objective outcome. © 2012 American College of Rheumatology",

    abstract = {BACKGROUND:In neuroimaging, connectivity refers to the correlations between signals in different brain regions. Although fMRI measures of connectivity have been widely explored, the methods used have varied. This complicates the interpretation of existing literature in cases when different techniques have been used with fMRI data to measure the single concept of "connectivity." Additionally the optimum choice of method for future analyses is often unclear.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:In this study, measures of functional and effective connectivity in the motor system were calculated based on three sources of variation: inter-subject variation in task activation level; within-subject variation in task-related responses; and within-subject residual variation after removal of task effects. Two task conditions were compared. The methods yielded different inter-regional correlation coefficients. However, all three approaches produced similar results, qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively, for condition differences in connectivity.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:While these results are specific to the motor regions studied, they do suggest that within-subject and across-subject results may be usefully compared. Also, the presence of task-specific correlations in residual time series supports arguments that residuals may not substitute for resting-state data, but rather may reflect the same underlying variations present during steady-state performance.},

    abstract = "Various abnormalities in frontal and striatal regions have been reported in children with prenatal alcohol and/or methamphetamine exposure. In a recent fMRI study, we observed a correlation between accuracy on a working-memory task and functional activation in the putamen in children with prenatal methamphetamine and polydrug exposure. Because the putamen is part of the corticostriatal motor loop whereas the caudate is involved in the executive loop, we hypothesized that a loss of segregation between distinct corticostriatal networks may occur in these participants. The current study was designed to test this hypothesis using functional connectivity MRI. We examined 50 children ranging in age from 7 to 15, including 19 with prenatal methamphetamine exposure (15 of whom had concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure), 13 with prenatal exposure to alcohol but not methamphetamine, and 18 unexposed controls. We measured the coupling between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fluctuations during a working-memory task in four striatal seed regions and those in the rest of the brain. We found that the putamen seeds showed increased connectivity with frontal brain regions involved in executive functions while the caudate seeds showed decreased connectivity with some of these regions in both groups of exposed subjects compared to controls. These findings suggest that localized brain abnormalities resulting from prenatal exposure to alcohol and/or methamphetamine lead to a partial rewiring of corticostriatal networks. These results represent important progress in the field, and could have substantial clinical significance in helping devise more targeted treatments and remediation strategies designed to better serve the needs of this population",

Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measurement of the synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring voxels, was examined. Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with GTCS showed bilaterally and symmetrically altered ReHo in the cortical and subcortical structures. In addition, a correlation analysis of the ReHo measurement versus the epilepsy duration was performed, and highly negative correlations were observed in thalamus, insula and the regions followed the pattern of 'default' state of brain function. The current findings demonstrate that altered regional synchronization of brain activity exists in the patients with GTCS during interictal period, and there is potential in utilizing the ReHo method in RS-fMRI analyses of epilepsy.",

    abstract = {For resting-state fMRI data, independent component analysis (ICA) is an excellent method which enables the decomposition of high-dimensional data into discrete spatial and temporal components. Fully Exploratory Network ICA (FENICA), a fully automated and purely data-driven ICA-based analysis for group assessment of resting-state networks, was proposed by Sch\"{o}pf et al. (2010). FENICA is a novel and effective group assessment method, but it is not without limitations, such as those related to memory and time costs in running. Here we present Fast-FENICA, which is based on an energy sifting algorithm for interested networks, a linear candidate networks formation strategy and a correlation coefficients ranking algorithm of network matrix. It is demonstrated that the energy sifting algorithm for interested networks and linear candidate networks formation strategy can transform the stubborn computing time and memory cost limitations of FENICA from a quadratic level to a linear level and thus speed up the group evaluation. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients ranking algorithm can further increase the calculation speed and float up the consistent networks effectively. In comparison to FENICA, the hybrid data and true data experimental results demonstrate that Fast-FENICA not only contributes to the practicability and efficiency without decreasing the detecting ability of functional networks, but also ranks the common functional networks based on the whole spatial consistency at a group level. This proposed effective group analysis method is expected to have wide applicability},

    abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has become a particularly useful tool for studying regional relationships in typical and atypical populations. Because many investigators have already obtained large data sets of task-related fMRI, the ability to use this existing task data for resting state fcMRI is of considerable interest. Two classes of data sets could potentially be modified to emulate resting state data. These data sets include: (1) "interleaved" resting blocks from blocked or mixed blocked/event-related sets, and (2) residual timecourses from event-related sets that lack rest blocks. Using correlation analysis, we compared the functional connectivity of resting epochs taken from a mixed blocked/event-related design fMRI data set and the residuals derived from event-related data with standard continuous resting state data to determine which class of data can best emulate resting state data. We show that, despite some differences, the functional connectivity for the interleaved resting periods taken from blocked designs is both qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to that of "continuous" resting state data. In contrast, despite being qualitatively similar to "continuous" resting state data, residuals derived from event-related design data had several distinct quantitative differences. These results suggest that the interleaved resting state data such as those taken from blocked or mixed blocked/event-related fMRI designs are well-suited for resting state functional connectivity analyses. Although using event-related data residuals for resting state functional connectivity may still be useful, results should be interpreted with care.},

    abstract = "Faces activate specific brain regions in fMRI, including the fusiform gyrus (FG) and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). The fact that the FG and pSTS are frequently co-activated suggests that they may interact synergistically in a distributed face processing network. Alternatively, the functions implemented by these regions may be encapsulated from each other. It has proven difficult to evaluate these two accounts during visual processing of face stimuli. However, if the FG and pSTS interact during face processing, the substrate for such interactions may be apparent in a correlation of the BOLD timeseries from these two regions during periods of rest when no faces are present. To examine face-specific resting correlations, we developed a new partial functional connectivity approach in which we removed variance from the FG that was shared with other category-selective and control regions. The remaining face-specific FG resting variance was then used to predict resting signals throughout the brain. In two experiments, we observed face-specific resting functional connectivity between FG and pSTS, and importantly, these correlations overlapped precisely with the face-specific pSTS region obtained from independent localizer runs. Additional region-of-interest and pattern analyses confirmed that the FG-pSTS resting correlations were face-specific. These findings support a model in which face processing is distributed among a finite number of connected, but nevertheless face-specialized regions. The discovery of category-specific interactions in the absence of visual input suggests that resting networks may provide a latent foundation for task processing",

Recent studies have shown that connectivity within the default mode network is reduced with age and have demonstrated a clear relation of these changes with cognitive functioning. However, research on age-related changes in other functional networks is sparse and mainly focused on prespecified functional networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity during a visual oddball task in a range of functional networks. It was found that compared with young participants, elderly showed a decrease in connectivity between areas belonging to the same functional network. This was found in the default mode network and the somatomotor network. Moreover, in all identified networks, elderly showed increased connectivity between areas within these networks and areas belonging to different functional networks. Decreased connectivity within functional networks was related to poorer cognitive functioning in elderly. The results were interpreted as a decrease in the specificity of functional networks in older participants. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

This manuscript addresses the question of whether an individualized assessment of motion may be informative, and whether it may be beneficial with regard to explaining motion-related variance. Two independent datasets are used to explore and test this hypothesis, from a total of 21 healthy children, performing either no externally-cued task (resting state) or an active listening paradigm (beep story). Translations and rotations are combined into one single, individual measure of total displacement, which is demonstrated to be substantially different between brain regions as a function of their distance from the individual origin. An increasing number of covariates leads to a loss of detection power, but more so on the first than on the second level, and more so in less-powerful designs. Synthetic timeseries are calculated from which the direct effects of motion as well as motion*B0 effects can be isolated, allowing to extract individual timecourses which reflect both direct and indirect motion effects. Including three timecourses from such an individually-derived "motion fingerprint" into first-level statistical analyses explains variance to a similar degree as the commonly-used approach of including the realignment parameters, and performance is statistically equivalent to including the realignment parameters on the second level. A more individualized approach to explaining motion-related variance may therefore be beneficial, depending on the scenario},

    abstract = {Functional brain networks detected in task-free ("resting-state") functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have a small-world architecture that reflects a robust functional organization of the brain. Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Task-free fMRI data from 21 AD subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the fMRI data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in AD showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p<0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p<0.01) in the AD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished AD participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72\% and specificity of 78\%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in AD. Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in AD, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging.},

Whether the fluctuations of resting fMRI signal in RSNs are a direct consequence of neocortical neuronal activity or are low-frequency artifacts due to other physiological processes (e.g., autonomically driven fluctuations in cerebral blood flow) is uncertain. In order to investigate further these fluctuations, we have characterized their spatial and temporal properties using probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA), a robust approach to RSN identification. Here, we provide evidence that: i. RSNs are not caused by signal artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar RSNs also can be identified in perfusion fMRI data; and iv. at least 5 distinct RSN patterns are reproducible across different subjects. The RSNs appear to reflect "default" interactions related to functional networks related to those recruited by specific types of cognitive processes. RSNs are a major source of non-modeled signal in BOLD fMRI data, so a full understanding of their dynamics will improve the interpretation of functional brain imaging studies more generally. Because RSNs reflect interactions in cognitively relevant functional networks, they offer a new approach to the characterization of state changes with pathology and the effects of drugs.},

    abstract = "Many components of resting-state (RS) FMRI show non-random structure that has little to do with neural connectivity but can covary over multiple brain structures. Some of these signals originate in physiology and others are hardware-related. One artifact discussed herein may be caused by defects in the receive coil array or the RF amplifiers powering it. During a scan, this artifact results in small image intensity shifts in parts of the brain imaged by the affected array components. These shifts introduce artifactual correlations in RS time series on the spatial scale of the coil's sensitivity profile, and can markedly bias RS connectivity results. We show that such a transient artifact can be substantially removed from RS time series by using locally formed regressors from white matter tissue. This is particularly important in arrays with larger numbers of coils, which may generate smaller artifact zones. In such a case, brain-wide average noise estimates would fail to capture the artifact. We also examine the anatomical structure of artifactual variance in RS FMRI time series, by identifying sources that contribute to these signals and where in the brain are they manifested. We consider current methods for reducing confounding sources (or noises) and their effects on connectivity maps, and offer an improved approach (ANATICOR) that can also reduce hardware artifacts. The methods described herein are currently available with AFNI, in addition to tools for rapid, interactive generation of seed-based correlation maps at single-subject and group levels.",

Images were parcellated using a prior anatomical template, yielding regional mean time series for each of 90 regions (major cortical gyri and subcortical nuclei) in each subject. Significant pairwise functional connections, defined by the group mean inter-regional partial correlation matrix, were mostly either local and intrahemispheric or symmetrically interhemispheric. Low-frequency components in the time series subtended stronger inter-regional correlations than high-frequency components. Intrahemispheric connectivity was generally related to anatomical distance by an inverse square law; many symmetrical interhemispheric connections were stronger than predicted by the anatomical distance between bilaterally homologous regions. Strong interhemispheric connectivity was notably absent in data acquired from a single patient, minimally conscious following a brainstem lesion. Multivariate analysis by hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling consistently defined six major systems in healthy volunteers-- corresponding approximately to four neocortical lobes, medial temporal lobe and subcortical nuclei- - that could be further decomposed into anatomically and functionally plausible subsystems, e.g. dorsal and ventral divisions of occipital cortex. An undirected graph derived by thresholding the healthy group mean partial correlation matrix demonstrated local clustering or cliquishness of connectivity and short mean path length compatible with prior data on small world characteristics of non-human cortical anatomy. Functional MRI demonstrates a neurophysiological architecture of the normal human brain that is anatomically sensible, strongly symmetrical, disrupted by acute brain injury, subtended predominantly by low frequencies and consistent with a small world network topology.",

It has also been shown that the DMN is suppressed by scanner background noise (SBN), which is the noise produced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, it is unclear whether different approaches to "rest" in the noisy MR environment can alter the DMN and constitute a confound in studies investigating the DMN in particular patient populations (e.g., individuals with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease). We examined 27 healthy adult volunteers who completed an fMRI experiment with three different instructions for rest: (1) relax and be still, (2) attend to SBN, or (3) ignore SBN. Region of interest analyses were performed to determine the influence of rest period instructions on core regions of the DMN and DMN regions previously reported to be altered in patients with or at risk for Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. The dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) exhibited greater activity when specific resting instructions were given (i.e., attend to or ignore SBN) compared to when non-specific resting instructions were given. Condition-related differences in connectivity were also observed between regions of the dmPFC and inferior parietal/posterior superior temporal cortex. We conclude that rest period instructions and SBN levels should be carefully considered for fMRI studies on the DMN, especially studies on clinical populations and groups that may have different approaches to rest, such as first-time research participants and children},

Features of static and dynamic cerebral blood flow (CBF) were analyzed to reflect the specific brain response to PHN pain. Eleven consecutive patients suffering from PHN and 11 age- and gender-matched control subjects underwent perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scanning during the resting state. Group comparison was conducted to detect the regions with significant changes of CBF in PHN patients. Then we chose those regions that were highly correlated with the self-reported pain intensity as "seeds" to calculate the functional connectivity of both groups. Absolute CBF values of these regions were also compared across PHN patients and control subjects. Significant increases in CBF of the patient group were observed in left striatum, right thalamus, left primary somatosensory cortex (S1), left insula, left amygdala, left primary somatomotor cortex, and left inferior parietal lobule. Significant decreases in CBF were mainly located in the frontal cortex. Regional CBF in the left caudate, left insula, left S1, and right thalamus was highly correlated with the pain intensity, and further comparison showed that the regional CBF in these regions is significantly higher in PHN groups. Functional connectivity results demonstrated that the reward circuitry involved in striatum, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus and the circuitry among striatum, thalamus, and insula were highly correlated with each element in PHN patients.

    abstract = "AIMS:Many fMRI protocols for localizing speech comprehension have been described, but there has been little quantitative comparison of these methods. We compared five such protocols in terms of areas activated, extent of activation, and lateralization.METHODS:fMRI BOLD signals were measured in 26 healthy adults during passive listening and active tasks using words and tones. Contrasts were designed to identify speech perception and semantic processing systems. Activation extent and lateralization were quantified by counting activated voxels in each hemisphere for each participant.RESULTS:Passive listening to words produced bilateral superior temporal activation. After controlling for prelinguistic auditory processing, only a small area in the left superior temporal sulcus responded selectively to speech. Active tasks engaged an extensive, bilateral attention, and executive processing network. Optimal results (consistent activation and strongly lateralized pattern) were obtained by contrasting an active semantic decision task with a tone decision task. There was striking similarity between the network of brain regions activated by the semantic task and the network of brain regions that showed task-induced deactivation, suggesting that semantic processing occurs during the resting state.CONCLUSIONS:fMRI protocols for mapping speech comprehension systems differ dramatically in pattern, extent, and lateralization of activation. Brain regions involved in semantic processing were identified only when an active, nonlinguistic task was used as a baseline, supporting the notion that semantic processing occurs whenever attentional resources are not controlled.

    abstract = "In this report we demonstrate a hemodynamic scaling method with resting-state fluctuation of amplitude (RSFA) in healthy adult younger and older subject groups. We show that RSFA correlated with breath hold (BH) responses throughout the brain in groups of younger and older subjects which RSFA and BH performed comparably in accounting for age-related hemodynamic coupling changes, and yielded more veridical estimates of age-related differences in task-related neural activity. BOLD data from younger and older adults performing motor and cognitive tasks were scaled using RSFA and BH related signal changes. Scaling with RSFA and BH reduced the skew of the BOLD response amplitude distribution in each subject and reduced mean BOLD amplitude and variability in both age groups. Statistically significant differences in intrasubject amplitude variation across regions of activated cortex, and intersubject amplitude variation in regions of activated cortex were observed between younger and older subject groups. Intra- and intersubject variability differences were mitigated after scaling. RSFA, though similar to BH in minimizing skew in the unscaled BOLD amplitude distribution, attenuated the neural activity-related BOLD amplitude significantly less than BH. The amplitude and spatial extent of group activation were lower in the older than in the younger group before and after scaling. After accounting for vascular variability differences through scaling, age-related decreases in activation volume were observed during the motor and cognitive tasks. The results suggest that RSFA-scaled data yield age-related neural activity differences during task performance with negligible effects from non-neural (i.e., vascular) sources.",

Metaanalytical modelling using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) for the integration of neuroimaging results has already been successfully applied to several distinct tasks, thereby revealing the cortical localization of cognitive functions. We used the same algorithm and technique with all available and suitable PET and fMRI studies employing a vestibular stimulus. Most consistently across 28 experiments vestibular stimuli evoked activity in the right hemispheric parietal opercular area OP 2 implicating it as the core region for vestibular processing. Furthermore, we took our primary results as a seeding point and fed them into a functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state oscillations in 100 healthy subjects. This subsequent calculation confirmed direct connections of the area OP 2 with every other region found in the meta-analysis, in particular temporo-parietal regions, premotor cortex, and the midcingulate gyrus. Thus revealing a joint vestibular network in accordance with a concept from animal literature termed the inner vestibular circle. Moreover, there was also a significant vestibular connectivity overlap with frontal but not parietal cortical centres responsible for the generation of saccadic eye movements. This was shown in an additional ocular motor meta-analysis. We conclude that the cytoarchitectonic area OP 2 in the parietal operculum, embedded in a joint vestibular network, should be the primary candidate for the human vestibular cortex. This area may represent the human homologue to the vestibular area PIVC as proposed by Guldin and Gr\"{u}sser in non-human primates},

Large-scale structural and functional brain networks both exhibit a small-world topology, which is evidence for global and local parallel information processing. Meanwhile, resting state networks (RSNs) underlying specific biological functions have provided insights into how intrinsic functional architecture influences cognitive and perceptual information processing. However, topological properties of single RSNs remain poorly understood. Here, we have two hypotheses: i) each RSN also has optimized small-world architecture; ii) topological properties of RSNs related to perceptual and higher cognitive processes are different. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the topological properties of the default-mode, dorsal attention, central-executive, somato-motor, visual and auditory networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found small-world topology in each RSN. Furthermore, small-world properties of cognitive networks were higher than those of perceptual networks. Our findings are the first to demonstrate a topological fractionation between perceptual and higher cognitive networks. Our approach may be useful for clinical research, especially for diseases that show selective abnormal connectivity in specific brain networks.",

We collected data to characterize how much imaging time is necessary to obtain reproducible quantitative functional connectivity measurements needed for a reliable single-subject diagnostic test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 100 five-minute BOLD scans on a single subject, divided into 10 sessions of 10 scans each, with the subject at rest or while watching video clips of cartoons. These data were compared with resting-state BOLD scans from 36 healthy control subjects by evaluating the correlation between each pair of 64 small spheric regions of interest obtained from a published functional brain parcellation. RESULTS: Single-subject and group data converged to reliable estimates of individual and population connectivity values proportional to 1 / sqrt(n). Dramatic improvements in reliability were seen by using ≤25 minutes of imaging time, with smaller improvements for additional time. Functional connectivity "fingerprints" for the individual and population began diverging at approximately 15 minutes of imaging time, with increasing reliability even at 4 hours of imaging time. Twenty-five minutes of BOLD imaging time was required before any individual connections could reliably discriminate an individual from a group of healthy control subjects. A classifier discriminating scans during which our subject was resting or watching cartoons was 95\% accurate at 10 minutes and 100\% accurate at 15 minutes of imaging time. CONCLUSIONS: An individual subject and control population converged to reliable different functional connectivity profiles that were task-modulated and could be discriminated with sufficient imaging time.},

Spontaneous fluctuations were recorded using a series of gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging (EPI) images before creation of the MCAO, and the same scan protocols were duplicated at the time of 60 min, 2 h after creation of the MCAO. FMRI signal time series from the different ROIs of ischemic cortex and normal cortex were preprocessed and low pass filtered. After preprocessing, the serial fMRI data was obtained by fast Fourier transformation to calculate the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations. Meanwhile, time course signal changes from a seed voxel of normal cortex were correlated with every voxel in the brain. Statistical analysis was performed across all rats to determine the extent of spatial correlation between regions.RESULTS: The amplitude of LFBF in the ischemic cortex between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz was lightly decreased during the super acute ischemic stroke. Howerever, the amplitude of LFBF in contralateral cortex was increased after 2 hours. Spatial distribution of LFBF, from cross-correlation analysis, indicates that the substantial inter-hemispheric synchrony of ischemic region was decreased and of contralateral cortex was enhanced during the super acute ischemic stroke.CONCLUSION: The contrast behavior of the resting state BOLD signal fluctuations and a intra-hemispheric symmetry in the LFBF with similar phase characteristics in most other regions during super acute ischemic stroke can be implied a new approach to detect the physiological activity functions and the distinct resting neural networks after the acute ischemic stroke takes place.",

Here we present functional connectivity analyses of this region using resting-state functional MRI data collected from both humans and macaque monkeys. Three distinct patterns of functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for RSFC as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.",

Our results revealed the significant negative correlation between neuroticism and ReHo in the left middle frontal gyrus, providing evidence for the left frontal activation involved in pleasant emotion. ReHo was correlated negatively with extraversion in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), an important portion of the default mode network (DMN), thus further indicating the relationship between DMN and personality. In addition, ReHo in the insula, cerebellum and cingulate gyrus was correlated positively with extraversion, suggesting the associations between individual difference in extraversion and specific brain regions involved in affective processing.

    abstract = "While goal-directed thinking has received the lion's share of neuroscientific attention, its counterpart-the undirected thought flow that comes to mind unbidden and without effort-has remained largely on the sidelines of scientific research. Such undirected thought, however, forms a large part of our mental experience. The last decade of neuroscientific investigations marked a resurgence of interest and work into the neural basis of undirected thought. This article reviews the current status of the field and examines the research on the three most frequently discussed categories of undirected thought: spontaneous thought, stimulus-independent thought, and mind wandering. The terminology and paradigms for investigating undirected thought are still being developed, while research is gradually moving beyond strictly task- and rest-based paradigms and towards incorporating introspective first-person reports in order to better understand this phenomenon. It is impossible to say at this point that undirected thinking is preferentially linked to any one particular brain system. Although its connection to the default network has been disproportionately emphasized in the literature, other brain networks such as the executive system and the temporal lobe memory network appear to be equally involved. In addition to reviewing the literature, this article also presents novel findings regarding the functional connectivity between large-scale brain networks during mind wandering. These findings reveal the presence of positive functional connectivity between regions of the default and executive networks and negative functional connectivity between the default network and primary sensory cortices. Thus, the default and executive networks can closely cooperate in supporting undirected thought processes, and seem to do so at times when the primary sensory cortices are not busy with the processing of perceptual information from the external environment.

The anticorrelated relationship the DMN shares with task-related networks permits the quantification of this network both during task (task-induced deactivations: TID) and during periods of passive mental activity (extended rest). However, the effects of different methodologies (TID vs. extended rest) for quantifying the DMN in the same clinical population are currently not well understood. Moreover, several different analytic techniques, including independent component analyses (ICA) and seed-based correlation analyses, exist for examining functional connectivity during extended resting states. The current study compared both methodologies and analytic techniques in a group of patients with schizophrenia (SP) and matched healthy controls. Results indicated that TID analyses, ICA, and seed-based correlation all consistently identified the midline (anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus) and lateral parietal cortex as core regions of the DMN, as well as more variable involvement of temporal lobe structures. In addition, SP exhibited increased deactivation during task, as well as decreased functional connectivity with frontal regions and increased connectivity with posterior and subcortical areas during periods of extended rest. The increased posterior and reduced anterior connectivity may partially explain some of the cognitive dysfunction and clinical symptoms that are frequently associated with schizophrenia.",

    title = "{A software tool for interactive exploration of intrinsic functional connectivity opens new perspectives for brain surgery.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (fcrs-fMRI) has been shown to be a robust non-invasive method for localization of functional networks (without using specific tasks) and to be promising for presurgical planning. However, in order to transfer the approach to everyday clinical practice, fcrs-fMRI needs to be further validated and made easily accessible to neurosurgeons. This paper addresses the latter by presenting a software tool designed for neurosurgeons for analyzing and visualizing fcrs-fMRI data. METHODS: A prototypical interactive visualization tool was developed to enable neurosurgeons to explore functional connectivity data and evaluate its usability. The implementation builds upon LIPSIA, an established software package for the assessment of functional neuroimaging data, and integrates the selection of a region-of-interest with the computation and visualization of functionally connected areas. The tool was used to explore data from a healthy participant and eight brain lesion patients. The usability of the software was evaluated with four neurosurgeons previously unacquainted with the methodology, who were asked to identify prominent, large-scale cortical networks. FINDINGS: With this novel tool, previously published findings, such as tumor displacement of the sensorimotor cortex and other disturbances of functional networks, were reproduced. The neurosurgeons were able to consistently obtain results similar to the results of an expert, with the exception of the language network. Immediate feedback helped to pinpoint functional networks quickly and intuitively, with even inexperienced users requiring less than 3 min per network. CONCLUSIONS: Although fcrs-fMRI is a nascent method still undergoing evaluation with respect to established standards, the interactive software is nonetheless a promising tool for non-invasive exploration of individual functional connectivity networks in neurosurgical practice, both for well-known networks and for those less typically addressed.",

Also fMRI research recently focused on the resting condition and identified several resting state networks. In order to deepen the understanding of different levels of global brain function from relaxed wakefulness to sleep onset the association between EEG-vigilance stages and BOLD signals was analysed. EEG-vigilance stages were attributed to consecutive 3-sec-EEG-segments by an algorithm using topographic and spectral information. Results of the classification were validated by analysing the heart rates during the different brain states. Vigilance stages served as regressors for the analysis of the simultaneously acquired fMRI data. Additionally resting state networks were derived from the fMRI data using independent component analysis (ICA). Also vigilance associated brain activity revealed by EEG-based standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA) was compared to the results of the fMRI analysis. Results showed increased BOLD signal in the occipital cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the frontal cortex, the parietal cortices and the temporal cortices and decreasing BOLD signals in the thalamus and the frontal cortex for declining vigilance stages (A2, A3, B1, B2/B3) in comparison to the high vigilance stage A1. Resting state networks revealed a spatial overlap with the vigilance stage associated BOLD maps in conjunction analyses. sLORETA showed increased neuroelectric alpha activity at the occipital cortex comparable to occipital BOLD signal decreases when comparing stage A with stage B. Different EEG-vigilance stages during rest are associated with pronounced differences of BOLD signals in several brain areas which partly correspond to the resting state networks. For cognitive fMRI-research it therefore seems important to pay attention to vigilance switches in order to separate vigilance associated BOLD signal changes from those specifically related to cognition.",

We discuss eight articles that directly compare resting-state functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral hemispheres. All studies examined show largely convergent results: the strength of resting-state functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity strength. However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, which most likely indicates functional correlations mediated by indirect structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their complementary strengths are applied in parallel, we can expect important advances in our diagnostic and prognostic capacities in diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.",

    abstract = "The analysis of spontaneous fluctuations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals has recently gained attention as a powerful tool for investigating brain circuits in a non-invasive manner. Correlation-based connectivity analysis investigates the correlations of spontaneous fluctuations of the fMRI signal either between a single seed region of interest (ROI) and the rest of the brain or between multiple ROIs. To do this, a priori knowledge is required for defining the ROI(s) and without such knowledge functional connectivity fMRI cannot be used as an exploratory tool for investigating the functional organization of the brain and its modulation under different conditions. In this work we examine two indices that provide voxel based maps reflecting the intrinsic connectivity contrast (ICC) of individual tissue elements without the need for defining ROIs and hence require no a priori information or assumptions. These voxel based ICC measures can also be used to delineate regions of interest for further functional or network analyses. The indices were applied to the study of sevoflurane anesthesia-induced alterations in intrinsic connectivity. In concordance with previous studies, the results show that sevoflurane affects different brain circuits in a heterogeneous manner.

    abstract = "Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) has been widely applied to explore group and individual differences. A confounding factor is head motion. Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on fcMRI estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements (>0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of fcMRI variation across subjects was not linked to head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on fcMRI network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks--two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions--a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals",

We identified a "salience network," anchored by dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) and orbital frontoinsular cortices with robust connectivity to subcortical and limbic structures, and an "executive-control network" that links dorsolateral frontal and parietal neocortices. These intrinsic connectivity networks showed dissociable correlations with functions measured outside the scanner. Prescan anxiety ratings correlated with intrinsic functional connectivity of the dACC node of the salience network, but with no region in the executive-control network, whereas executive task performance correlated with lateral parietal nodes of the executive-control network, but with no region in the salience network.

However, little is known about the neuropsychological underpinnings of this impaired impulsive control network on drug addiction. Twenty two abstinent heroin dependent (HD) subjects and 15 cognitively normal (CN) subjects participated in this study. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI was employed to measure abnormalities in the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity (iAFC) network activity and the Barratt Impulsive Scale, 11th version was used to measure impulsivity. Linear regression analysis was applied to detect the neural constructs underlying impulsivity by correlating iAFC network activity with impulsive scores. In the HD group, higher impulsivity scores and significantly enhanced iAFC network activity were found, especially in bilateral thalamus, right insula, and inferior frontal gyrus. Markedly decreased anticorrelated iAFC network activity was seen in the left precuneus, and even switched to positive correlation pattern in right precuneus, relative to the CN group. The iAFC network strengths in the HD group were positively correlated with impulsivity in the right subcallosal gyrus, insula, thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex, and negatively correlated in left fusiform area. In the CN group, the left pre-somamotor area-amygdala connectivity was positively correlated, and right orbital frontal cortex-amygdala and precuneus-amygdala connectivity were negatively correlated with impulsivity scores. Our study demonstrates different constructs of the impulsive network in HD and CN subjects. Altered iAFC network connectivity in HD subjects may contribute to the loss of impulsive control. This further facilitates our understanding of the neural underpinnings of behavior dysfunction in addiction.",

The purpose was to identify the utility of each method in distinguishing between healthy and brain-injured individuals, and determine whether observed differences have clinical significance. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from 25 patients with TAI and 17 healthy controls. Patients were scanned 6-11 months post-injury, and functional and neurocognitive outcomes were assessed the same day. Using all three approaches, TAI subjects revealed significantly weaker functional connectivity (FC) than controls, and binary logistic regressions demonstrated all three approaches have discriminant value. Clinical outcomes were not correlated with FC using any approach. Results suggest that compromise to the functional connectedness of the DMN after TAI can be identified using resting-state FC; however, the degree of functional compromise to this network, as measured in this study, may not have clinical implications in chronic TAI",

DMN functional connectivity was evaluated from rs-fMRI data via independent component analysis. T2 lesion load (LL) was computed by a semi-automatic method and global and local atrophy was estimated by SIENAX and SPM8 voxel-based morphometry analyses from 3D-T1 images.RESULTS: When the whole group of RRMS patients was compared with HCs, DMN connectivity was significantly weaker in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas it was significantly weaker in the core but stronger at the periphery of the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings were more evident in CP than CI patients. Observed DMN changes did not correlate with global atrophy or T2-LL, but were locally associated with regional grey matter loss.CONCLUSION: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients show a consistent dysfunction of DMN at the level of the anterior node. DMN distribution changes in the posterior node may reflect a possible compensatory effect on cognitive performance.",

Despite the wide application of this approach in human neuroscience, the neural mechanisms that give rise to spontaneous fMRI correlations are largely unknown. Here we review results of recent electrophysiological studies in the cerebral cortex of humans and nonhuman primates that link neural activity to ongoing fMRI fluctuations. We begin by describing results obtained with simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiological measurements that allow for the identification of direct neural correlates of resting state functional connectivity. We next highlight experiments that investigate the correlational structure of spontaneous neural signals, including the spatial variation of signal coherence over the cortical surface, across cortical laminae, and between the two hemispheres. In the final section we speculate on the origins and potential consequences of ongoing signals for normal brain function, and point out inherent limitations of the fMRI correlation approach},

    abstract = "In investigations of the brain's resting state using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a seed-based approach is commonly used to identify brain regions that are functionally connected. The seed is typically identified based on anatomical landmarks, coordinates, or the location of brain activity during a separate task. However, anatomical boundaries may be difficult to discern, and designing a task to interrogate desired brain regions of interest may be difficult, especially when subject compliance is in question, as in many patient studies. In this study, a seed selection method based on inter-voxel cross-correlation of resting-state signals (i.e., a rest-based seed) is introduced. This method was used to determine resting-state connectivity between the left and right motor cortices in fifteen healthy right-handed subjects, and results were compared to seed selection based on the most significantly activated voxels during a separate task (i.e., a task-based seed). The z-coordinate of the centers of mass of the rest-based and task-based seeds within motor cortex were significantly different; task-based seeds were closer to the pial surface. Connectivity maps generated by rest-based seeds and task-based seeds were statistically equivalent; however, only 3 min of data were required to reach significance for rest-based seeds compared to an estimated 6 min for task-based seeds. Rest-based seeds also exhibited good inter-experimenter reproducibility. These findings suggest that seed regions based on inter-voxel cross-correlation of resting-state signals can be used as an alternative approach for connectivity analysis when task-related activity is not available or difficult to acquire, as in some patient studies.",

To date, enormous effort has been focused on addressing this issue in humans by combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) with other techniques. However, this research area is significantly underexplored in animals, perhaps because of confounding effects of anesthetic agents used in most animal experiments on functional connectivity. To bridge this gap, we have systematically investigated the intrinsic connectional architecture in the rodent brain by using a previously established awake-animal imaging model. First, group independent component analysis was applied to the rsfMRI data to extract elementary functional clusters of the brain. The connectional relationships between these clusters, as evaluated by partial correlation analysis, were then used to construct a graph of whole-brain neural network. This network exhibited the typical features of small-worldness and strong community structures seen in the human brain. Finally, the whole-brain network was segregated into community structures using a graph-based analysis. The results of this work provided a functional atlas of intrinsic connectional architecture of the rat brain at both intraregion and interregion levels. More importantly, the current work revealed that functional networks in rats are organized in a nontrivial manner and conserve fundamental topological properties that are also seen in the human brain. Given the high psychopathological relevance of network organization of the brain, this study demonstrated the feasibility of studying mechanisms and therapies of multiple neurological and psychiatric diseases through translational research.",

In this paper we examine how trait mindfulness of older, obese adults may moderate brain networks that arise from exposure to such cues. Nineteen older, obese adults came to our laboratory on two different occasions. Both times they ate a controlled breakfast meal and then were restricted from eating for 2.5 h. After this brief period of food restriction, they had an fMRI scan in which they were exposed to food cues and then underwent a 5 min recovery period to evaluate brain networks at rest. On one day they consumed a BOOST® liquid meal prior to scanning, whereas on the other day they only consumed water (NO BOOST® condition). We found that adults high in trait mindfulness were able to return to their default mode network (DMN), as indicated by greater global efficiency in the precuneus, during the post-exposure rest period. This effect was stronger for the BOOST® than NO BOOST® treatment condition. Older adults low in trait mindfulness did not exhibit this pattern in the DMN. In fact, the brain networks of those low on the MAAS suggests that they continued to be pre-occupied with the elaboration of food cues even after cue exposure had ended. Further work is needed to examine whether mindfulness-based therapies alter brain networks to food cues and whether these changes are related to eating behavior",

    abstract = {Studies have identified specific brain regions that increase activation during rest relative to attention-demanding tasks; these regions subserve the "default mode of brain function". Most of these studies have been conducted in the presence of scanner background noise (SBN). This noise has been shown to lead to altered attentional demands, and thus may modulate the default-mode network. Twelve subjects were examined during a rest condition that was contrasted with an auditory task. Words were presented either with SBN employing a conventional acquisition or without SBN using a sparse sampling approach. The number of experimental and resting trials was equated between the designs. Selecting the images in the condition with SBN that corresponded in time with the images in the condition without SBN made a direct comparison of the default-mode network (rest contrasted with active task) possible. There was typical activation of the default-mode network during rest versus task for both designs. However, SBN suppressed major components of the default-mode network, including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. Our results suggest that the default mode of brain function differs when assessed in the presence compared to the absence of scanner noise, with the presence of scanner noise perhaps adding attentional demands that diminish activation changes between rest and task in a nonlinear way within the default network. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the use of a sparse sampling technique might enhance clinical utilities that have been proposed for analysis of the default-mode network},

    abstract = "One of the main obstacles in quantitative interpretation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal is that this signal is influenced by non-neural factors such as vascular properties of the brain, which effectively increases signal variability. One approach to account for non-neural components is to identify and measure these confounding factors and to include them as covariates in data analysis or interpretation. Previously, several research groups have independently identified four potential physiologic modulators of fMRI signals, including baseline venous oxygenation (Y(v) ), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), resting state BOLD fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), and baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study sought to directly compare the modulation effects of these indices in the same fMRI session. The physiologic parameters were measured with techniques comparable with those used in the previous studies except for CBF, which was determined globally with a velocity-based phase-contrast MRI (instead of arterial-spin-labeling MRI). Using an event-related, scene-categorization fMRI task, we showed that the fMRI signal amplitude was positively correlated with CVR (P < 0.0001) and RSFA (P = 0.002), while negatively correlated with baseline Y(v) (P < 0.0001). The fMRI-CBF correlation did not reach significance, although the (negative) sign of the correlation was consistent with the earlier study. Furthermore, among the physiologic modulators themselves, significant correlations were observed between baseline Y(v) and baseline CBF (P = 0.01), and between CVR and RSFA (P = 0.05), suggesting that some of the modulators may partly be of similar physiologic origins. These observations as well as findings in recent literature suggest that additional measurement of physiologic modulator(s) in an fMRI session may provide a practical approach to control for inter-subject variations and to improve the ability of fMRI in detecting disease or medication related differences.

    abstract = "While resting state functional connectivity has been shown to decrease in patients with mild and/or moderate Alzheimer's disease, it is not yet known how functional connectivity changes in patients as the disease progresses. Furthermore, it has been noted that the default mode network is not as homogenous as previously assumed and several fractionations of the network have been proposed. Here, we separately investigated the modulation of 3 default mode subnetworks, as identified with group independent component analysis, by comparing Alzheimer's disease patients to healthy controls and by assessing connectivity changes over time. Our results showed decreased connectivity at baseline in patients versus controls in the posterior default mode network, and increased connectivity in the anterior and ventral default mode networks. At follow-up, functional connectivity decreased across all default mode systems in patients. Our results suggest that earlier in the disease, regions of the posterior default mode network start to disengage whereas regions within the anterior and ventral networks enhance their connectivity. However, as the disease progresses, connectivity within all systems eventually deteriorates",

    title = "{Thalamocortical dysconnectivity in schizophrenia.}",
    abstract = "OBJECTIVE The thalamus and cerebral cortex are connected via topographically organized, reciprocal connections. Previous studies have revealed thalamic abnormalities in schizophrenia; however, it is not known whether thalamocortical networks are differentially affected in the disorder. To explore this possibility, the authors examined functional connectivity in intrinsic low-frequency blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations between major divisions of the cortex and thalamus using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). METHOD Seventy-seven healthy subjects and 62 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state fMRI. To identify functional subdivisions of the thalamus, the authors parceled the cortex into six regions of interest: the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex/supplementary motor area, somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe, posterior parietal cortex, and occipital lobe. Mean BOLD time series were extracted for each region of interest and entered into a seed-based functional connectivity analysis. RESULTS Consistent with previous reports, activity in distinct cortical areas correlated with specific, largely nonoverlapping regions of the thalamus in both healthy comparison subjects and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and increased motor/somatosensory-thalamic connectivity in schizophrenia. The changes in connectivity were unrelated to local gray matter content within the thalamus and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No differences were observed in temporal, posterior parietal, or occipital cortex connectivity with the thalamus. CONCLUSIONS These findings establish differential abnormalities of thalamocortical networks in schizophrenia. The etiology of schizophrenia may disrupt the development of prefrontal-thalamic connectivity and refinement of somatomotor connectivity with the thalamus that occurs during brain maturation",

The precise function of these rhythms is not clear. We used simultaneous EEG-fMRI during a bimanual motor task to localize brain areas involved in Rolandic alpha and beta EEG rhythms. The identification of these rhythms in the MR environment was achieved by a blind source separation algorithm. Rhythm "strength", i.e. spectral power determined by wavelet analysis, inversely correlated most strongly with the fMRI-BOLD signal in the postcentral cortex for the Rolandic alpha (mu) rhythm and in the precentral cortex for the Rolandic beta rhythm. FMRI correlates of Rolandic alpha and beta rhythms were distinct from those associated with the posterior "classical" alpha rhythm, which correlated inversely with the BOLD signal in the occipital cortex. An inverse correlation with the BOLD signal in the respective sensory area seems to be a general feature of "idle rhythms".},

    abstract = {Characterization of large-scale brain networks using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging is typically based on the assumption of network stationarity across the duration of scan. Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks (RSNs) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize RSN dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the "oculomotor (OCM) network" strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows (<60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the OCM network and did not emerge in average RSN analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that RSNs can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure.

    abstract = "Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1-100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, <0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space-time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.",

METHODS: Eighteen TRD patients, 17 TSD patients and 17 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy subjects participated in the resting-state fMRI scans. RESULTS: There are widespread differences in ALFF values among TRD patients, TSD patients and healthy subjects throughout the cerebellum, the visual recognition circuit (middle temporal gyrus, middle/inferior occipital gyrus and fusiform), the hate circuit (putamen), the default circuit (ACC and medial frontal gyrus) and the risk/action circuit (inferior frontal gyrus). The brain circuits between the TRD and TSD patients are mainly in the cerebellum, the visual recognition circuit and the default circuit.

In total 17 ADHD boys and 17 matched controls were recruited to undergo rfMRI scan on a 3.0T MRI system.

Functional images were processed in AFNI for calculation of ALFF and then group comparison was performed using voxel-based t-test. With a corrected threshold of p<0.05 determined by AlphaSim, we found that in comparison with controls, ADHD patients demonstrated higher ALFF values in the left superior frontal gyrus and sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and lower ALFF values in the bilateral anterior, middle cingulate and the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Significant correlations were found between patients' WSCT measures and the peak ALFF located in the right MFG (r=0.69, p=0.02), and the left SMC (r=0.65, p=0.03).

    abstract = "The default mode network (DMN), based in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), exhibits higher metabolic activity at rest than during performance of externally oriented cognitive tasks. Recent studies have suggested that competitive relationships between the DMN and various task-positive networks involved in task performance are intrinsically represented in the brain in the form of strong negative correlations (anticorrelations) between spontaneous fluctuations in these networks. Most neuroimaging studies characterize the DMN as a homogenous network, thus few have examined the differential contributions of DMN components to such competitive relationships. Here, we examined functional differentiation within the DMN, with an emphasis on understanding competitive relationships between this and other networks. We used a seed correlation approach on resting-state data to assess differences in functional connectivity between these two regions and their anticorrelated networks. While the positively correlated networks for the vmPFC and PCC seeds largely overlapped, the anticorrelated networks for each showed striking differences. Activity in vmPFC negatively predicted activity in parietal visual spatial and temporal attention networks, whereas activity in PCC negatively predicted activity in prefrontal-based motor control circuits. Granger causality analyses suggest that vmPFC and PCC exert greater influence on their anticorrelated networks than the other way around, suggesting that these two default mode nodes may directly modulate activity in task-positive networks. Thus, the two major nodes comprising the DMN are differentiated with respect to the specific brain systems with which they interact, suggesting greater heterogeneity within this network than is commonly appreciated",

ASL is an innovative imaging technique which sidesteps the limitations of other functional neuroimaging techniques (functional MRI, positron emission tomography). A statistical analysis of perfusion maps was performed using SPM2 software. Statistically significant hyperperfusion regions were found in the depressed patient group compared with the healthy control group in the following: the bilateral sACC, left prefrontal dorsomedian cortex, left ACC and left subcortical areas (putamen, pallidum and amygdala). This study confirmed the involvement of the sACC in depression, particularly chronic and treatment-resistant depression, using ASL at 3T, a safe perfusion technique that seems to be appropriate for investigating functional abnormalities in psychiatric disorders.",

To determine the mechanism by which high-frequency neural activity results in low-frequency BOLD fluctuations, I obtained measurements of the effects of neurovascular coupling on the frequency content of BOLD fluctuations.MATERIALS AND METHODS:3T recordings of BOLD signal intensity in the primary visual cortex were obtained in response to visual stimuli presented at varying temporal frequencies to determine which stimulus frequencies were successfully transmitted to BOLD signal intensity. Additional BOLD time series recordings were performed in a resting state and during natural visual stimulation, and frequencies comprising BOLD fluctuations were measured. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) time series recordings were obtained in a resting state to measure which components of MEG signal intensity best correlated in frequency distribution to observed BOLD fluctuations.RESULTS:Visually driven oscillations in BOLD signal intensity were observed up to 0.2 Hz, representing a mismatch between low-pass filter properties of neurovascular coupling and observed frequencies of spontaneous BOLD fluctuations, which are <0.05 Hz in the primary visual cortex. Visual stimulation frequencies of >0.2 Hz resulted in frequency-dependent increases in mean BOLD response. Amplitude modulation of high-frequency neural activity was measured in MEG time series data, which demonstrated 1/frequency distribution with the greatest power comprising frequencies <0.05 Hz, consistent with the distribution of observed BOLD fluctuations.CONCLUSION:Synchronized low-frequency BOLD fluctuations likely arise from a combination of vascular low-pass filtering and low-frequency amplitude modulation of neural activity.",

In this article, the authors longitudinally studied voxel-based morphometry and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging 10 times in 1 patient during the course of Bell palsy (idiopathic facial nerve palsy) up to complete clinical recovery. RESULTS: . Morphometric analysis revealed a significant alteration in the face area of the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the paretic face, with an initial increase in gray matter concentration. Functional connectivity analysis between the M1 and other parts of the facial motor network revealed acutely disrupted intrahemispheric connectivity but unaltered interhemispheric connectivity. The disrupted functional connectivity was most pronounced on the day of the onset of symptoms, with a subsequent return toward normal during the course of recovery. This time course was found to differ between the selected parts of the facial motor network. However, the increase in functional connectivity strength preceded clinical recovery in all areas and reached a stable level before the patient fully recovered. CONCLUSION: . These results demonstrate that recovery from facial nerve palsy is complemented by cortical reorganization, with pronounced changes of functional connectivity that precede clinical recovery",

One important focus has been on the analysis of brain connectivity using the concept of networks instead of regions. Approximately ten years ago, two important research areas grew out of this concept. First, a network proposed to be "a default mode of brain function" since dubbed the default mode network was proposed by Raichle. Secondly, multisubject or group independent component analysis (ICA) provided a data-driven approach to study properties of brain networks, including the default mode network. In this paper, we provide a focused review of how ICA has contributed to the study of intrinsic networks. We discuss some methodological considerations for group ICA and highlight multiple analytic approaches for studying brain networks. We also show examples of some of the differences observed in the default mode and resting networks in the diseased brain. In summary, we are in exciting times and still just beginning to reap the benefits of the richness of functional brain networks as well as available analytic approaches},

Specifically, PCC/PCu dysfunction was positively related to the impairments of episodic memory from baseline to follow up in aMCI group.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The patterns of longitudinal deficits of DMN may assist investigators to identify and monitor the development of aMCI.",

    abstract = "RATIONALE: The default mode network (DMN), one of several resting-state networks (RSN) in the brain, is thought to be involved in self-referential thought, awareness, and episodic memories. Nicotine improves cognitive performance, in part by improving attention. Nicotinic agonists have been shown to decrease activity in regions within DMN and increase activity in regions involved in visual attention during effortful processing of external stimuli. It is unknown if these pharmacological effects also occur in the absence of effortful processing. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine if nicotine suppresses activity in default mode and enhances activity in extra-striate RSNs in the absence of an external visual task. METHODS: Within-subject, single-blinded, counterbalanced study of 19 non-smoking subjects who had resting functional MRI scans after 7 mg nicotine or placebo patch. Group independent component analysis was performed. The DMN component was identified by spatial correlation with a reference DMN mask. A visual attention component was identified by spatial correlation with an extra-striate mask. Analyses were conducted using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: Nicotine was associated with decreased activity in regions within the DMN and increased activity in extra-striate regions. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of DMN and enhancement of extra-striate resting-state activity in the absence of visual stimuli or effortful processing suggest that nicotine's cognitive effects may involve a shift in activity from networks that process internal to those that process external information. This is a potential mechanism by which cholinergic agonists may have a beneficial effect in diseases associated with altered resting-state activity.",

    title = "{Regional grey matter loss and brain disconnection across Alzheimer disease evolution.}",
    abstract = "It is becoming increasingly clearer that the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not only associated with regional grey matter (GM) damage, but also with abnormal integration between cortical brain regions by disconnection mechanism. This concept comes from the evidence that white matter (WM) damage (as assessed by diffusion MR imaging) can be observed in patients with AD since the early clinical stages, and it correlates with clinical measures of cognitive disability. In this perspective, several functional imaging studies, based on PET and resting state fMRI, have provided evidence that brain hypometabolism/disconnection may precede the occurrence of GM atrophy in certain regions of AD brains, such as the cingulate cortex. The cingulum represents the most prominent WM tract of the limbic system, being directly connected to the medial temporal lobe structures. Therefore, this structure likely contributes to changes in functional connectivity observed within the so called default-mode network of AD patients, and its damage is likely to play a remarkable role in the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Nowadays, the combination of several neuroimaging techniques that provide both, measures of regional GM loss and measures of functional and structural connectivity offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the pathophysiological changes of brain tissue modifications across the clinical evolution of AD. This paper reviews the main MR based methods of investigation of brain tissue involvement in patients with AD and MCI, and the role they have played in clarifying the differential contribution of GM damage and brain disconnection to AD pathophysiology. This subject seems to be relevant for both, speculative aspects of neurology and application to clinical trials.",

    abstract = "Most of what is known about the reorganization of functional brain networks that accompanies normal aging is based on neuroimaging studies in which participants perform specific tasks. In these studies, reorganization is defined by the differences in task activation between young and old adults. However, task activation differences could be the result of differences in task performance, strategy, or motivation, and not necessarily reflect reorganization. Resting-state fMRI provides a method of investigating functional brain networks without such confounds. Here, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used in an attempt to differentiate older adults from younger adults based on their resting-state functional connectivity. In addition, the information used by the SVM was investigated to see what functional connections best differentiated younger adult brains from older adult brains. Three separate resting-state scans from 26 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults (55-85) were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset made publically available in the 1000 Functional Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000. 100 seed-regions from four functional networks with 5mm(3) radius were defined based on a recent study using machine learning classifiers on adolescent brains. Time-series for every seed-region were averaged and three matrices of z-transformed correlation coefficients were created for each subject corresponding to each individual's three resting-state scans. SVM was then applied using leave-one-out cross-validation. The SVM classifier was 84\% accurate in classifying older and younger adult brains. The majority of the connections used by the classifier to distinguish subjects by age came from seed-regions belonging to the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks. These results suggest that age-related decreases in positive correlations within the cingulo-opercular and default networks, and decreases in negative correlations between the default and sensorimotor networks, are the distinguishing characteristics of age-related reorganization",

In this paper, a unified schema of voxel-wise functional connectivity and asymmetry analysis was presented and the network asymmetry of motor areas was studied. Twelve healthy male subjects with mean age 29.8±6.4 were studied. Functional network in the resting state was described by using functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) analysis. Motor areas were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). Network asymmetry, including intra- and inter-network asymmetries, was formulated and analyzed. The intra-network asymmetry was defined as the difference between the left and right part of a particular functional network. The inter-network asymmetry was defined as the difference between the networks for a specific ROI in the left hemisphere and its homotopic ROI in the right hemisphere. Primary motor area (M1), primary sensory area (S1) and premotor area (PMA) exhibited higher functional correlation with the right parietal-temporal-occipital circuit and the middle frontal gyrus than they did with the left hemisphere. Right S1 and right PMA exhibited higher functional correlation with the ipsilateral precentral and supramarginal areas. There exist the large-scale hierarchical network asymmetries of the motor areas in the resting state. These asymmetries imply the right hemisphere dominance for predictive motor coding based on spatial attention and higher sensory processing load for the motor performance of non-dominant hemisphere",

    abstract = "Recent functional imaging studies have indicated that the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be associated with the changes in spontaneous low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) blood oxygenation level-dependent fluctuations (LFBF) measured during a resting state. The purpose of this study was to examine regional LFBF coherence patterns in early AD and the impact of regional brain atrophy on the functional results. Both structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI scans were collected from 14 AD subjects and 14 age-matched normal controls. We found significant regional coherence decreases in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) in the AD patients when compared with the normal controls. Moreover, the decrease in the PCC/PCu coherence was correlated with the disease progression measured by the Mini-Mental State Exam scores. The changes in LFBF in the PCC/PCu may be related to the resting hypometabolism in this region commonly detected in previous positron emission tomography studies of early AD. When the regional PCC/PCu atrophy was controlled, these results still remained significant but with a decrease in the statistical power, suggesting that the LFBF results are at least partly explained by the regional atrophy. In addition, we also found increased LFBF coherence in the bilateral cuneus, right lingual gyrus and left fusiform gyrus in the AD patients. These regions are consistent with previous findings of AD-related increased activation during cognitive tasks explained in terms of a compensatory-recruitment hypothesis. Finally, our study indicated that regional brain atrophy could be an important consideration in functional imaging studies of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying hypnosis and especially the modulation of pain perception by hypnosis remain obscure. Using PET we first described the distribution of regional cerebral blood flow during the hypnotic state. Hypnosis relied on revivification of pleasant autobiographical memories and was compared to imaging autobiographical material in "normal alertness". The hypnotic state was related to the activation of a widespread set of cortical areas involving occipital, parietal, precentral, premotor, and ventrolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. This pattern of activation shares some similarities with mental imagery, from which it mainly differs by the relative deactivation of precuneus. Second, we looked at the anti-nociceptive effects of hypnosis. Compared to the resting state, hypnosis reduced pain perception by approximately 50\%. The hypnosis-induced reduction of affective and sensory responses to noxious thermal stimulation were modulated by the activity in the midcingulate cortex (area 24a'). Finally, we assessed changes in cerebral functional connectivity related to hypnosis. Compared to normal alertness (i.e., rest and mental imagery), the hypnotic state, significantly enhanced the functional modulation between midcingulate cortex and a large neural network involved in sensory, affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of nociception. These findings show that not only pharmacological but also psychological strategies for pain control can modulate the cerebral network involved in noxious perception.},

The ln cosh and kurtosis contrast functions were also compared using resting-state fMRI data from 10 normal adult volunteers.RESULTS:Higher-order contrast functions provided superior performance compared to lower-order contrast functions in the evaluation of metrics and via the simulations in the presence of a significant amount of noise. The performance of kurtosis was not statistically significantly different from that of a theoretically optimized contrast function. The choice of contrast function was found to result in substantial (R < 0.9) differences in 40\% of the components found from the resting-state fMRI data.CONCLUSION:The use of higher-order contrast functions, such as kurtosis, may provide superior performance in ICA analysis of fMRI data with low SNR.",

This study demonstrates this technique's continued viability at a field strength of 4 Tesla, affording a proportionally greater sensitivity to changes in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. In addition, for the study of alpha correlations, the authors used a larger number of subjects and scanning sessions than in the previous work. Random effects group regression analysis of 35 EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions against occipital alpha magnitude in a relaxed state detected bilateral widespread activation of dorsal thalamus and portions of the anterior cingulate and cerebellum. In the same group analysis, deactivations arose predominantly in the fusiform and adjacent visual association areas with a small activation cluster also detected in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This pattern is consistent with a correspondence between alpha magnitude variations and resting state network dynamics ascertained by recent studies of low frequency spontaneous BOLD fluctuations. The central role of the thalamus in resting state networks correlated with alpha activity is highlighted. Demonstrating the applicability of simultaneous EEG/functional magnetic resonance imaging up to 4 Tesla is particularly important for clinically relevant research involving challenging spontaneous EEG abnormalities, such as those of epilepsy.",

    abstract = "Recent brain imaging studies have emphasized the role of regional brain activity abnormalities in the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia (FD). However, whether the functional connectivity between brain regions is changed, especially between the cerebral hemispheres, in patients with FD remains unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes in patients with FD. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) was performed in 26 patients with FD and in 20 matched healthy controls. An interhemispheric RSFC map was obtained by calculating the Pearson correlation (Fisher Z transformed) between each pair of homotopic voxel time series for each subject. The between-group difference in interhemispheric RSFC was then examined at global and voxelwise levels separately. The global difference in interhemispheric RSFC between groups was tested using the independent two-sample t-test. Voxelwise comparisons were carried out using a permutation-based nonparametric test, and multiple comparisons across space were corrected using the threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method. The results showed that patients with FD had higher global interhemispheric RSFC than healthy controls (p < 0.01). Furthermore, voxelwise analysis revealed that patients with FD had increased interhemispheric RSFC in brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and thalamus (p < 0.01, TFCE corrected). Our findings provide preliminary evidence of interhemispheric correlation abnormalities in patients with FD and contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease.

    abstract = "Electrophysiological studies have long demonstrated a high degree of correlated activity between the left and right hemispheres, however little is known about regional variation in this interhemispheric coordination. Whereas cognitive models and neuroanatomical evidence suggest differences in coordination across primary sensory-motor cortices versus higher-order association areas, these have not been characterized. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 62 healthy volunteers to examine interregional correlation in spontaneous low-frequency hemodynamic fluctuations. Using a probabilistic atlas, we correlated probability-weighted time series from 112 regions comprising the entire cerebrum. We then examined regional variation in correlated activity between homotopic regions, contrasting primary sensory-motor cortices, unimodal association areas, and heteromodal association areas. Consistent with previous studies, robustly correlated spontaneous activity was noted between all homotopic regions, which was significantly higher than that between nonhomotopic (heterotopic and intrahemispheric) regions. We further demonstrated substantial regional variation in homotopic interhemispheric correlations that was highly consistent across subjects. Specifically, there was a gradient of interhemispheric correlation, with highest correlations across primary sensory-motor cortices (0.758, SD=0.152), significantly lower correlations across unimodal association areas (0.597, SD=0.230) and still lower correlations across heteromodal association areas (0.517, SD=0.226). These results demonstrate functional differences in interhemispheric coordination related to the brain's hierarchical subdivisions. Synchrony across primary cortices may reflect networks engaged in bilateral sensory integration and motor coordination, whereas lower coordination across heteromodal association areas is consistent with functional lateralization of these regions. This novel method of examining interhemispheric coordination may yield insights regarding diverse disease processes as well as healthy development.",

Their cognitive functions were evaluated by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Mattis dementia rating scale (DRS). The resting-state BOLD-fMRI data were acquired and preprocessed. Then the correlation coefficient of every pair of 90 regions was calculated and correlation matrix Z (N×N, N = 90) generated by Fisher Z transformation. The small-world property of functional brain networks was tested for AD patients and normal elders according to the definition of small-worldness. The changes of relevant parameters in AD patients were examined by two sample t-tests.RESULTS: Behavioral results: the MMSE scores of AD group and normal controls (NOR) were 20.60 ± 2.30 and 28.20 ± 1.80 respectively. The DRS scores of AD and NOR groups were 96.00 ± 10.82 and 123.22 ± 13.74 respectively. The MMSE and DRS scores were statistically different between two groups. Calculation of small-world parameters: Within the range of 0.1 ≤ Sparsity ≤ 0.4, both groups satisfied the small-world property. However, the clustering coefficient Cp and the average shortest path Lp of AD group were significantly higher than those of NOR group at each threshold (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The functional brain networks in AD patients still have the property of small-world. But the levels of Cp and Lp are higher in AD patients than those in normal controls. It suggests that the capacity of information transmission in functional brain networks and the ability of information integration in different brain regions in AD patients are impaired. This finding is of great importance in elucidating the pathological mechanisms of AD from the viewpoint of networks",

    abstract = "Functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions is thought to be central to the way in which the brain processes information. Abnormal connectivity is thought to be implicated in a number of diseases. The ability to study FC is therefore a key goal for neuroimaging. Functional connectivity (fc) MRI has become a popular tool to make connectivity measurements but the technique is limited by its indirect nature. A multimodal approach is therefore an attractive means to investigate the electrodynamic mechanisms underlying hemodynamic connectivity. In this paper, we investigate resting state FC using fcMRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In fcMRI, we exploit the advantages afforded by ultra high magnetic field. In MEG we apply envelope correlation and coherence techniques to source space projected MEG signals. We show that beamforming provides an excellent means to measure FC in source space using MEG data. However, care must be taken when interpreting these measurements since cross talk between voxels in source space can potentially lead to spurious connectivity and this must be taken into account in all studies of this type. We show good spatial agreement between FC measured independently using MEG and fcMRI; FC between sensorimotor cortices was observed using both modalities, with the best spatial agreement when MEG data are filtered into the $\beta$ band. This finding helps to reduce the potential confounds associated with each modality alone: while it helps reduce the uncertainties in spatial patterns generated by MEG (brought about by the ill posed inverse problem), addition of electrodynamic metric confirms the neural basis of fcMRI measurements. Finally, we show that multiple MEG based FC metrics allow the potential to move beyond what is possible using fcMRI, and investigate the nature of electrodynamic connectivity. Our results extend those from previous studies and add weight to the argument that neural oscillations are intimately related to functional connectivity and the BOLD response.",

    abstract = "During the past two decades, the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has fundamentally changed our understanding of brain-behavior relationships. However, the data from any one study add only incrementally to the big picture. This fact raises important questions about the dominant practice of performing studies in isolation. To what extent are the findings from any single study reproducible? Are researchers who lack the resources to conduct a fMRI study being needlessly excluded? Is pre-existing fMRI data being used effectively to train new students in the field? Here, we will argue that greater sharing and synthesis of raw fMRI data among researchers would make the answers to all of these questions more favorable to scientific discovery than they are today and that such sharing is an important next step for advancing the field of cognitive neuroscience",

    abstract = "Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet-repeat expansion-mutation in the Huntingtin gene. Subjects at risk for HD can be identified by genetic testing in the prodromal phase. Structural changes of basal-ganglia nuclei such as the caudate nucleus are well-replicated findings observable early in prodromal-HD subjects and may be preceded by distinct functional alterations of cortico-striatal circuits. This study aims to assess functional integrity of the motor system as a cortico-striatal circuit with particular clinical relevance in HD. Ten subjects in the prodromal phase of HD and ten matched controls were administered blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest (3T). Functional connectivity was measured as synchrony of BOLD activity between the caudate nucleus and thirteen cortical brain regions (seeds). Basal-ganglia volumes were assessed as established markers of disease progression in prodromal-HD. Linear regression analysis was performed to test for a relationship between structural changes and group differences in functional connectivity. Prodromal-HD subjects showed reduced BOLD synchrony between two seeds in the premotor cortex (BA6) and the caudate nucleus. While similar effect sizes could be observed for reduced basal-ganglia volumes and differences in functional connectivity, coefficients of determination indicate a moderate relationship between functional connectivity and striatal atrophy. Our data show reduced cortico-striatal functional connectivity at rest in prodromal-HD and suggest a relation to early structural brain changes. Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the temporal relationship between functional alterations and earliest structural brain changes in prodromal-HD",

Independent sensory networks are distinguished by two methods: data driven, where task activation defines regions of interest (ROI), and hypothesis driven, where regions are defined by the rat histological atlas. Success in these studies is attributed in part to the use of medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor) for anesthesia.

Commonly used regional interaction approaches, however, cannot address this question. In this paper, we proposed a multivariate network-level framework to directly quantify the interaction pattern between large-scale functional systems. The proposed framework was tested on three different brain states, including resting, finger tapping and movie watching using functional connectivity MRI. The interaction patterns among five predefined networks including dorsal attention (DA), default (DF), frontal-parietal control (FPC), motor-sensory (MS) and visual (V) were delineated during each state. Results show dramatic and expected network-level correlation changes across different states underscoring the importance of network-level interactions for successful transition between different states. In addition, our analysis provides preliminary evidence of the potential regulating role of FPC on the two opposing systems-DA and DF on the network level.",

Here, resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) is used to characterize the functional relationships of the pVWFA to help adjudicate between these possibilities. rs-fcMRI defines relationships based on correlations in slow fluctuations of blood oxygen level-dependent activity occurring at rest. In this study, rs-fcMRI correlations show little relationship between the pVWFA and reading-related regions but a strong relationship between the pVWFA and dorsal attention regions thought to be related to spatial and feature attention. The rs-fcMRI correlations between the pVWFA and regions of the dorsal attention network increase with age and reading skill, while the correlations between the pVWFA and reading-related regions do not. These results argue the pVWFA is not used predominantly in reading but is a more general visual processor used in other visual tasks, as well as reading",

    abstract = "The last two decades have witnessed great progress in mapping neural networks associated with task-induced brain activation. More recently, identification of resting state networks (RSN) paved the way to investigate spontaneous task-unrelated brain activity. The cardinal features characterising RSN are low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals synchronised between spatially distinct, but functionally connected brain areas. Simultaneous EEG/fMRI has been previously deployed to study the neurophysiological signature of RSN by comparing EEG power with BOLD amplitudes. We hypothesised that band-limited EEG power may be directly related to network-specific functional connectivity (FC) of BOLD signal time courses. Hence, we studied the association between individual EEG signature and FC in a core RSN, the so-called default mode network (DMN). Combined EEG/fMRI data of 20 healthy volunteers collected during a 15-minute rest period were analysed. Using an inter-subject analysis design, we demonstrated a network and frequency specific relation between RSN FC and EEG. In a multiple regression model, EEG band-powers explained 70\% of DMN FC variance, with significant partial correlations of DMN FC to delta (r=-0.73) and beta (r=0.53) power. The identified EEG pattern has been previously associated with increased alertness. Conversely, an established EEG-derived sedation index (spectral edge frequency SEF95) closely correlated with DMN FC. The study presents an approach that opens a new perspective to EEG/fMRI correlation. Direct evidence was provided for a distinct neurophysiological correlate of DMN FC. This finding further validates the biological relevance of network-specific intrinsic FC and provides an initial neurophysiological basis for interpreting studies of DMN FC alterations.",

The relationships between ALFF in regions with significant group differences and the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), disease duration, and T2 lesion volume (T2LV) were further explored.ResultsPatients with CIS had significantly decreased ALFF in the right anterior cingulate cortex, right caudate, right lingual gyrus, and right cuneus (P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using Monte Carlo simulation) compared to normal controls, while no significantly increased ALFF were observed in CIS. No significant correlation was found between the EDSS, disease duration, T2LV, and ALFF in regions with significant group differences.ConclusionIn patients with CIS, resting-state fMRI demonstrates decreased activity in several brain regions. These results are in contrast to patients with established MS, in whom ALFF demonstrates several regions of increased activity. It is possible that this shift from decreased activity in CIS to increased activity in MS could reflect the dynamics of cortical reorganization",

Forty-five individuals with a clinically definite diagnosis of MS were recruited for the study. Consistent with previous reports, hippocampus was functionally connected to the posteromedial cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and the medial frontal cortex. Higher levels of physical activity in MS patients were associated with an increased coherence between the hippocampus and the posteromedial cortex (PMC). The increased connectivity between these two regions, in turn, was predictive of better relational memory, such that MS patients who showed an increased coherence between the left (not right) hippocampus and the PMC also showed better relational memory.

Beyond intracortical effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional tDCS-driven alterations of subcortical areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is scarce. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortico-subcortical functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different striatal and thalamic regions to prove tDCS-induced alterations of the cortico-striato-thalamic circuit. fMRI resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 min of bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode/anode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. To control for possible placebo effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried out. Functional coupling between the left thalamus and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) significantly increased following anodal stimulation over M1. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and parietal association cortices was significantly strengthened. In contrast, cathodal tDCS over M1 decreased functional coupling between left M1 and contralateral putamen. In summary, in this study, we show for the first time that tDCS modulates functional connectivity of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical circuits. Here we highlight that anodal tDCS over M1 is capable of modulating elements of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical functional motor circuit. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

In the current study, we conducted a concurrent resting-state fMRI and NIRS experiment with healthy volunteers. LFO data was collected simultaneously at peripheral sites (middle fingertip and big toes) by NIRS, and centrally in the brain by BOLD fMRI. The cross-correlations of the LFOs collected from the finger, toes, and brain were calculated. Our data show that the LFOs measured in the periphery (NIRS signals) and in the brain (BOLD fMRI) were strongly correlated with varying time delays. This demonstrates that some portion of the LFOs actually reflect systemic physiological circulatory effects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NIRS is effective for measuring the peripheral LFOs, and that these LFOs and the temporal shifts between them are consistent in healthy participants and may serve as useful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring circulatory dysfunction",

In unpublished data utilizing an fMRI 2X2 design at resting state, NAAT in comparison to placebo shows activation of the caudate brain region and potentially a smoothing out of heroin-induced putamen (a site for emotionality) abnormal connectivity. Although awaiting final analysis, if confirmed by ongoing studies in China coupled with published qEEG results in America, showing an increase in alpha and low beta, NAAT may be shown to impact treatment outcomes.},

    abstract = "The regions that comprise the functionally connected resting-state default-mode network (DMN) in adults appear to be the same as those that are characterized by task-induced decreases in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Independent component analysis can be used to produce a picture of the DMN as an individual rests quietly in the scanner. Contrasts across conditions in which cognitive load is parametrically modulated can delineate neural structures that have decreases in activation in response to high-demand task conditions. Examination of the degree to which these networks subsume dissociable brain substrates, and of the degree to which they overlap, provides insight concerning their purpose, function, and the nature of their associations. Few studies have examined the DMN in children, and none have tested whether the neural regions that comprise the DMN during a resting condition are the same regions that show reduced activity when children engage in cognitive tasks. In this paper we describe regions that show both task-related decreases and spontaneous intrinsic activity at rest in children, and we examine the co-localization of these networks. We describe ways in which the DMN in 7-12-year-old children is both similar to and different from the DMN in adults; moreover, we document that task-induced deactivations and default-mode resting-state activity in children share common neural substrates. It appears, therefore, that even before adolescence a core aspect of task-induced deactivation involves reallocating processing resources that are active at rest. We describe how future studies assessing the development of these systems would benefit from examining these constructs as part of one continuous system",

In this single case study a small BOLD response synchronised with the stimulus paradigm is found globally, i.e. in all areas outside those of expected activation in a single subject study. The nature of the global response has similar shape properties to the archetypal BOLD HDR, with an early positive signal and a late negative response typical of the negative overshoot. Fitting Poisson curves to these responses showed that voxels were potentially split into two sets: one with dominantly positive signal and the other predominantly negative. A description, quantification and mapping of the global BOLD response is provided along with a 2 × 2 classification table test to demonstrate existence with very high statistical confidence. Potential explanations of the global response are proposed in terms of 1) global HDR balancing; 2) resting state network modulation; and 3) biological systems synchronised with the stimulus cycle. Whilst these widespread and low-level patterns seem unlikely to provide additional information for determining activation in functional neuroimaging studies as conceived in the last 15 years, knowledge of their properties may assist more comprehensive accounts of brain connectivity in the future.",

In this work, we examined resting-state fMRI networks from 194 subjects at a voxel-level resolution, and examined the consistency of RSNs across subjects using a metric called scaled inclusivity (SI), which summarizes consistency of modular partitions across networks. Our SI analyses indicated that some RSNs are robust across subjects, comparable to the corresponding RSNs identified by ICA. We also found that some commonly reported RSNs are less consistent across subjects.

    abstract = "The ADHD-200 Global Competition provides an excellent opportunity for building diagnostic classifiers of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI data. Here, we introduce a simple method to classify ADHD based on morphological information without using functional data. Our test results show that the accuracy of this approach is competitive with methods based on rs-fMRI data. We used isotropic local binary patterns on three orthogonal planes (LBP-TOP) to extract features from MR brain images. Subsequently, support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop classification models based on the extracted features. In this study, a total of 436 male subjects (210 with ADHD and 226 controls) were analyzed to show the discriminative power of the method. To analyze the properties of this approach, we tested disparate LBP-TOP features from various parcellations and different image resolutions. Additionally, morphological information using a single brain tissue type (i.e., gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and CSF) was tested. The highest accuracy we achieved was 0.6995. The LBP-TOP was found to provide better discriminative power using whole-brain data as the input. Datasets with higher resolution can train models with increased accuracy. The information from GM plays a more important role than that of other tissue types. These results and the properties of LBP-TOP suggest that most of the disparate feature distribution comes from different patterns of cortical folding. Using LBP-TOP, we provide an ADHD classification model based only on anatomical information, which is easier to obtain in the clinical environment and which is simpler to preprocess compared with rs-fMRI data",

Among the brain regions implicated in this network, several, including the posterior cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobes, have also shown decreased metabolism early in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reasoned that default-mode network activity might therefore be abnormal in AD. To test this hypothesis, we used independent component analysis to isolate the network in a group of 13 subjects with mild AD and in a group of 13 age-matched elderly controls as they performed a simple sensory-motor processing task. Three important findings are reported. Prominent coactivation of the hippocampus, detected in all groups, suggests that the default-mode network is closely involved with episodic memory processing. The AD group showed decreased resting-state activity in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, suggesting that disrupted connectivity between these two regions accounts for the posterior cingulate hypometabolism commonly detected in positron emission tomography studies of early AD. Finally, a goodness-of-fit analysis applied at the individual subject level suggests that activity in the default-mode network may ultimately prove a sensitive and specific biomarker for incipient AD.",

    abstract = "Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06-0.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.",

Previous studies have shown that the primary function subserved by the default mode is that of an introspectively oriented, self-referential mode of mental activity. The default mode of brain function hypothesis is readdressed from the perspective of the presence of low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal changes (0.012-0.1 Hz) in the resting brain. The results show that the brain during rest is not tonically active in a single mode of brain function. Rather, the findings presented here suggest that the brain recurrently toggles between an introspectively oriented mode (default mode) and a state-of-mind that tentatively might be interpreted as an extrospectively oriented mode that involves a readiness and alertness to changes in the external and internal environment.",

Changes in posterior areas of the default network (DN) and the medial temporal lobes seem to be central to AD. These areas show remarkable disturbances in neuronal communication at all spatial levels and in very early stages of the disease.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether, like in schizophrenia, psychosis-related disruption in connectivity between certain regions, as an index of intrinsic functional disintegration, occurs in schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy (SLPE). In this study, we sought to determine abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with SLPE, compared with nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, and to assess correlations with psychopathological deficits.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Resting EEG was recorded in 21 patients with focal epilepsy and SLPE and in 21 clinically-matched non-psychotic epilepsy controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA software. For connectivity analysis, a novel nonlinear connectivity measure called "lagged phase synchronization" was used. We found increased theta oscillations in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), namely the medial and lateral parietal cortex bilaterally in the psychotic patients relative to their nonpsychotic counterparts. In addition, patients with psychosis had increased beta temporo-prefrontal connectivity in the hemisphere with predominant seizure focus. This functional connectivity in temporo-prefrontal circuits correlated with positive symptoms. Additionally, there was increased interhemispheric phase synchronization between the auditory cortex of the affected temporal lobe and the Broca's area correlating with auditory hallucination scores.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to dysfunction of parietal regions that are part of the DMN, resting-state disrupted connectivity of the medial temporal cortex with prefrontal areas that are either involved in the DMN or implicated in psychopathological dysfunction may be critical to schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This suggests that DMN deficits might be a core neurobiological feature of the disorder, and that abnormalities in theta oscillations and beta phase synchronization represent the underlying neural activity},

However, the neurobiological bases of these teratogenic effects have not been well characterized. Because activities in the default mode network (DMN) reflect intrinsic brain functions that are closely associated with arousal regulation and cognition, alterations in the DMN could underlie cognitive effects related to PCE. With resting-state and task activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the possible PCE related changes in functional brain connectivity and brain activation in the DMN. In the resting state, the PCE group was found to have stronger functional connectivity in the DMN, as compared to the nonexposed controls. During a working memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE group exhibited less deactivation in the DMN and their fMRI signal was more increased by emotional arousal. These data revealed additional neural effects related to PCE, and consistent with previous findings, indicate that PCE may affect behavior and functioning by increasing baseline arousal and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balancing mechanisms involved in cognitive resource allocation.",

Data for low-frequency BOLD fluctuations were acquired with subjects at rest and during continuous performance of a bilateral finger-tapping task. These data were low-pass filtered (<0.08 Hz), and cross correlations of all acquired pixels to a region of interest in the left precentral gyrus were calculated. Confidence levels were calculated from the cross correlations. The fraction of pixels in the right precentral gyrus above a confidence level of 95\% for correlation with the left precentral gyrus was calculated for each subject.RESULTS: A plot of the fraction of the right precentral gyrus with high correlation with the left precentral gyrus for the finger-tapping state versus the resting state showed a clear discrimination between patients with MS and control subjects. Compared with control subjects, patients with MS generally had a smaller fraction of the pixels in the right precentral gyrus above the confidence level. This finding indicates that our method results in greater than 60\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for discriminating patients with MS from control subjects. No significant correlation was found between clinical measures of MS disease and correlations of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations between left and right precentral gyri.CONCLUSION: On the basis of the connectivity measure of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations, patients with MS exhibited lower functional connectivity between right- and left-hemisphere primary motor cortices when compared with that in control subjects.",

These networks of spontaneous activity correlation or resting state networks (RSN) are closely related to the underlying anatomical connectivity, but their topography is also gated by the history of prior task activation. Network coherence does not depend on covert cognitive activity, but its strength and integrity relates to behavioral performance. Some RSN are functionally organized as dynamically competing systems both at rest and during tasks. Computational studies show that one of such dynamics, the anticorrelation between networks, depends on noise-driven transitions between different multistable cluster synchronization states. These multistable states emerge because of transmission delays between regions that are modeled as coupled oscillators systems. Large-scale systems dynamics are useful for keeping different functional subnetworks in a state of heightened competition, which can be stabilized and fired by even small modulations of either sensory or internal signals",

    abstract = "Previous studies have defined low-frequency, spatially consistent networks in resting fMRI data which may reflect functional connectivity. We sought to explore how a complex somatosensory stimulation, acupuncture, influences intrinsic connectivity in two of these networks: the default mode network (DMN) and sensorimotor network (SMN). We analyzed resting fMRI data taken before and after verum and sham acupuncture. Electrocardiography data were used to infer autonomic modulation through measures of heart rate variability (HRV). Probabilistic independent component analysis was used to separate resting fMRI data into DMN and SMN components. Following verum, but not sham, acupuncture there was increased DMN connectivity with pain (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), periaqueductal gray), affective (amygdala, ACC), and memory (hippocampal formation, middle temporal gyrus) related brain regions. Furthermore, increased DMN connectivity with the hippocampal formation, a region known to support memory and interconnected with autonomic brain regions, was negatively correlated with acupuncture-induced increase in a sympathetic related HRV metric (LFu), and positively correlated with a parasympathetic related metric (HFu). Following verum, but not sham, acupuncture there was also increased SMN connectivity with pain-related brain regions (ACC, cerebellum). We attribute differences between verum and sham acupuncture to more varied and stronger sensations evoked by verum acupuncture. Our results demonstrate for the first time that acupuncture can enhance the post-stimulation spatial extent of resting brain networks to include anti-nociceptive, memory, and affective brain regions. This modulation and sympathovagal response may relate to acupuncture analgesia and other potential therapeutic effects",

In this study we asked two questions: First, is it possible to attenuate intrinsic activity in the self-referential, default mode of brain function by directing the brains resources to a goal-oriented and attention-demanding task? Second, what effect does a sustained attention-demanding overt task performance have on the two intrinsically active networks in the brain, those being the task-negative, default-mode and the anticorrelated, task-positive network? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor spontaneous intrinsic activity during rest and sustained performance of a sequential two-back working memory task. We compared intrinsic activity during rest and the two-back task to the signal increases and decreases observed in an epoch-related version of the working memory task. Our results show that spontaneous intrinsic activity in the default-mode network is not extinguished but rather attenuated during performance of the working memory task. Moreover, we show that the intrinsic activity in the task-positive network is reorganized in response to the working memory task. The results presented here complements earlier work that have shown that task-induced signal deactivations in the default-mode regions is modulated by cognitive load to also show that intrinsic, spontaneous signal fluctuations in the default-mode regions persist and reorganize in response to changes in external work load",

    title = "{Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disruption in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: MRI studies, including recent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies, have shown corpus callosum abnormalities in children prenatally exposed to alcohol, especially in the posterior regions. These abnormalities appear across the range of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cognitive correlates of callosal abnormalities in FASD including deficits in visual-motor skill, verbal learning, and executive functioning. The goal of this study was to determine whether inter-hemispheric structural connectivity abnormalities in FASD are associated with disrupted inter-hemispheric functional connectivity and disrupted cognition. METHODS: Twenty-one children with FASD and 23 matched controls underwent a 6-minute resting-state functional MRI scan as well as anatomical imaging and DTI. Using a semi-automated method, we parsed the corpus callosum and delineated 7 inter-hemispheric white matter tracts with DTI tractography. Cortical regions of interest (ROIs) at the distal ends of these tracts were identified. Right-left correlations in resting fMRI signal were computed for these sets of ROIs, and group comparisons were made. Correlations with facial dysmorphology, cognition, and DTI measures were computed. RESULTS: A significant group difference in inter-hemispheric functional connectivity was seen in a posterior set of ROIs, the para-central region. Children with FASD had functional connectivity that was 12\% lower than in controls in this region. Subgroup analyses were not possible owing to small sample size, but the data suggest that there were effects across the FASD spectrum. No significant association with facial dysmorphology was found. Para-central functional connectivity was significantly correlated with DTI mean diffusivity, a measure of microstructural integrity, in posterior callosal tracts in controls but not in FASD. Significant correlations were seen between these structural and functional measures, and Wechsler perceptual reasoning ability. CONCLUSIONS: Inter-hemispheric functional connectivity disturbances were observed in children with FASD relative to controls. The disruption was measured in medial parietal regions (para-central) that are connected by posterior callosal fiber projections. We have previously shown microstructural abnormalities in these same posterior callosal regions, and the current study suggests a possible relationship between the two. These measures have clinical relevance as they are associated with cognitive functioning.",

    abstract = {The "default-mode" network is an ensemble of cortical regions, which are typically deactivated during demanding cognitive tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Using functional connectivity, this network can be conceptualized and studied as a "stand-alone" function or system. Regardless of the task, independent component analysis (ICA) produces a picture of the "default-mode" function even when the subject is performing a simple sensori-motor task or just resting in the scanner. This has boosted the use of default-mode fMRI for non-invasive research in brain disorders. Here, we studied the effect of cognitive load modulation of fMRI responses on the ICA-based pictures of the default-mode function. In a standard graded working memory study based on the n-back task, we used group-level ICA to explore the variability of the default-mode network related to the engagement in the task, in 10 healthy volunteers. The analysis of the default-mode components highlighted similarities and differences in the layout under three different cognitive loads. We found a load-related general increase of deactivation in the cortical network. Nonetheless, a variable recruitment of the cingulate regions was evident, with greater extension of the anterior and lesser extension of the posterior clusters when switching from lower to higher working memory loads. A co-activation of the hippocampus was only found under no working memory load. As a generalization of our results, the variability of the default-mode pattern may link the default-mode system as a whole to cognition and may more directly support use of the ICA model for evaluating cognitive decline in brain disorders},

For a broad application of this method especially for clinical populations and longitudinal studies, the reliability of this approach and its robustness to confounding factors need to be explored. Here we investigated test-retest reliability of graph metrics of functional networks derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded in 33 healthy subjects during rest. We constructed undirected networks based on the Anatomic-Automatic-Labeling (AAL) atlas template and calculated several commonly used measures from the field of graph theory, focusing on the influence of different strategies for confound correction. For each subject, method and session we computed the following graph metrics: clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, local and global efficiency, assortativity, modularity, hierarchy and the small-worldness scalar. Reliability of each graph metric was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Overall ICCs ranged from low to high (0 to 0.763) depending on the method and metric. Methodologically, the use of a broader frequency band (0.008-0.15 Hz) yielded highest reliability indices (mean ICC=0.484), followed by the use of global regression (mean ICC=0.399). In general, the second order metrics (small-worldness, hierarchy, assortativity) studied here, tended to be more robust than first order metrics. In conclusion, our study provides methodological recommendations which allow the computation of sufficiently robust markers of network organization using graph metrics derived from fMRI data at rest",

Knowing this is important to allow appropriate inferences from functional imaging studies of epileptic activity. Recent blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated negative BOLD responses (NBR) in frontal, parietal and posterior cingulate cortices during generalised spike wave activity (GSW). We hypothesized that GSW-related NBR commonly reflect decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF). We measured BOLD and cerebral blood flow responses using simultaneous EEG with BOLD and arterial spin label (ASL) fMRI at 3 T. Four patients with epilepsy were studied; two with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and two with secondary generalized epilepsy (SGE). We found GSW-related NBR in frontal, parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. We measured the coupling between BOLD and CBF changes during GSW and normal background EEG and found a positive correlation between the simultaneously measured BOLD and CBF throughout the imaged volume. Frontal and thalamic activation were seen in two patients with SGE, concordant with the electro-clinical features of their epilepsy. There was striking reproducibility of the GSW-associated BOLD response in subjects previously studied at 1.5 T. Our results show a preserved relationship between BOLD and CBF changes during rest and GSW activity consistent with normal neurovascular coupling in patients with generalized epilepsy and in particular during GSW activity. Cortical activations appear to reflect areas of discharge generation whilst deactivations reflect changes in conscious resting state activity.",

In the present fMRI study, seven nodes of the DMN were identified and their activity levels were rank-ordered based on a power spectral analysis of the resting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Furthermore, the direction of information flow among these DMN nodes was determined using Granger causality analysis and graph-theoretic methods. We found that the activity levels in these seven DMN nodes had a highly consistent hierarchical distribution, with the highest activity level in the posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices, followed by ventral medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and with the lowest level in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Importantly, a significant correlation was found between the activity levels and the In-Out degrees of information flow across the DMN nodes, suggesting that Granger causal influences can be used to predict BOLD activity levels. These findings shed light on the dynamical organization of cortical neuronal networks and may provide the basis for characterizing network disruption by brain disorders",

A human COMT polymorphism (Val(158)Met) alters enzyme activity and is associated with both the activation and functional connectivity of the PFC during task performance, particularly working memory. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a data-driven, independent components analysis (ICA) approach to compare resting state functional connectivity within the executive control network (ECN) between young, male COMT Val(158) (n=27) and Met(158) (n=28) homozygotes. COMT genotype effects on grey matter were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. COMT genotype significantly modulated functional connectivity within the ECN, which included the head of the caudate, and anterior cingulate and frontal cortical regions. Val(158) homozygotes showed greater functional connectivity between a cluster within the left ventrolateral PFC and the rest of the ECN (using a threshold of Z>2.3 and a family-wise error cluster significance level of p<0.05). This difference occurred in the absence of any alterations in grey matter. Our data show that COMT Val(158)Met affects the functional connectivity of the PFC at rest, complementing its prominent role in the activation and functional connectivity of this region during cognitive task performance. The results suggest that genotype-related differences in prefrontal dopaminergic tone result in neuroadaptive changes in basal functional connectivity, potentially including subtle COMT genotype-dependent differences in the relative coupling of task-positive and task-negative regions, which could in turn contribute to its effects on brain activation, connectivity, and behaviour",

METHODS: Eyes closed RS-fMRI data were acquired from 10 mTLE-HS patients (four right-side, six left-side) and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects, and were analyzed by using ReHo. For group analysis, four right-side MTLE-HS patients' functional images were flipped, in order to make a homogeneous left MTLE-HS group (10 cases) and increase the sample size. KEY FINDINGS: Compared to the healthy control group, patients showed significantly increased ReHo in ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus, midbrain, insula, corpus callosum, bilateral sensorimotor cortex, and frontoparietal subcortical structures, whereas decreased ReHo was observed mainly in default mode network (DMN) (including precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus, bilateral inferior lateral parietal, and mesial prefrontal cortex) and cerebellum in patients relative to the control group. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identified that ReHo pattern in mTLE-HS patients was altered compared to healthy controls. We consider decreased ReHo in DMN to be responsible for wide functional impairments in cognitive processes. We propose that the increased ReHo in specific regions may form a network that might be responsible for seizure genesis and propagation",

With the growing interest in studying synchronized BOLD fluctuations during the resting state, the extent to which the apparent synchrony is due to variations in the end-tidal pressure of CO(2) (PETCO(2)) is an important consideration. CO(2)-related fluctuations in BOLD signal may also represent a potential confound when studying task-related responses, especially if breathing depth and rate are affected by the task. While previous studies of the above issues have explored retrospective correction of BOLD fluctuations related to arterial PCO(2), here we demonstrate an alternative approach based on physiological clamping of the arterial CO(2) level to a near-constant value. We present data comparing resting state functional connectivity within the default-mode-network (DMN), as well as task-related BOLD responses, acquired in two conditions in each subject: 1) while subject's PETCO(2) was allowed to vary spontaneously; and 2) while controlling subject's PETCO(2) within a narrow range. Strong task-related responses and areas of maximal signal correlation in the DMN were not significantly altered by suppressing fluctuations in PETCO(2). Controlling PETCO(2) did, however, improve the performance of retrospective physiological noise correction techniques, allowing detection of additional regions of task-related response and resting-state connectivity in highly vascularized regions such as occipital cortex. While these results serve to further rule out systemic physiological fluctuations as a significant source of apparent resting-state network connectivity, they also demonstrate that fluctuations in arterial CO(2) are one of the factors limiting sensitivity in task-based and resting-state fMRI, particularly in regions of high vascular density.

The use of 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dedicated postprocessing tools to measure brain tissue volumes (cerebral cortical gray matter, white matter), surface and sulcation index can elucidate phenotypes associated with early behavior development. The use of diffusion tensor imaging can further help in assessing microstructural changes within the cerebral white matter and the establishment of brain connectivity. Finally, the use of functional MRI and resting-state functional MRI connectivity allows exploration of the impact of adverse conditions on functional brain connectivity in vivo. Results from studies using these methods have for the first time illustrated the structural impact of antenatal conditions and neonatal intensive care on the functional brain deficits observed after premature birth. In order to study the pathophysiology of these adverse conditions, MRI has also been used in conjunction with histology in animal models of injury in the immature brain.

The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz).RESULTS: For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies (<0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity MR imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient.CONCLUSION: Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

    abstract = {Functional imaging studies have begun to identify a set of brain regions whose brain activity is greater during 'rest' (e.g., fixation) states than during cognitive tasks. It has been posited that these regions constitute a network that supports the brain's default mode, which is temporarily suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors. Exogenous tasks that require cognitive effort are thought to command reallocation of resources away from the brain's default state. However, it remains unknown if brain activity during fixation periods between active task periods is influenced by previous task-related emotional content. We examined brain activity during periods of FIXATION (viewing and rating gray-scale images) interspersed among periods of viewing and rating complex images ('PICTURE') with positive, negative, and neutral affective content. We show that a selected group of brain regions (PCC, precuneus, IPL, vACC) do exhibit activity that is greater during FIXATION (>PICTURE); these regions have previously been implicated in the "default brain network". In addition, we report that activity within precuneus and IPL in the FIXATION period is attenuated by the precedent processing of images with positive and negative emotional content, relative to non-emotional content. These data suggest that the activity within regions implicated in the default network is modulated by the presence of environmental stimuli with motivational salience and, thus, adds to our understanding of the brain function during periods of low cognitive, emotional, or sensory demand},

Specifically, anodal tDCS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) together with cathodal tDCS of the supraorbital region have been associated with improvement of cognition and mood, and have been suggested for the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although modeled mathematically, the distribution, direction, and extent of tDCSmediated effects on brain physiology are not well understood. The current study investigates whether tDCS of the human prefrontal cortex modulates resting-state network (RSN) connectivity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirteen healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS in random order on separate days. tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA with the anode positioned over the left DLPFC and the cathode over the right supraorbital region. Patterns of resting-state brain connectivity were assessed before and after tDCS with 3 T fMRI, and changes were analyzed for relevant networks related to the stimulation- electrode localizations. At baseline, four RSNs were detected, corresponding to the default mode network (DMN), the left and right frontal-parietal networks (FPNs) and the self-referential network. After real tDCS and compared with sham tDCS, significant changes of regional brain connectivity were found for the DMN and the FPNs both close to the primary stimulation site and in connected brain regions. These findings show that prefrontal tDCS modulates resting-state functional connectivity in distinct functional networks of the human brain. © 2011 the authors.",

    abstract = "Functional and structural maturation of networks comprised of discrete regions is an important aspect of brain development. The default-mode network (DMN) is a prominent network which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTL), and angular gyrus (AG). Despite increasing interest in DMN function, little is known about its maturation from childhood to adulthood. Here we examine developmental changes in DMN connectivity using a multimodal imaging approach by combining resting-state fMRI, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography. We found that the DMN undergoes significant developmental changes in functional and structural connectivity, but these changes are not uniform across all DMN nodes. Convergent structural and functional connectivity analyses suggest that PCC-mPFC connectivity along the cingulum bundle is the most immature link in the DMN of children. Both PCC and mPFC also showed gray matter volume differences, as well as prominent macrostructural and microstructural differences in the dorsal cingulum bundle linking these regions. Notably, structural connectivity between PCC and left MTL was either weak or non-existent in children, even though functional connectivity did not differ from that of adults. These results imply that functional connectivity in children can reach adult-like levels despite weak structural connectivity. We propose that maturation of PCC-mPFC structural connectivity plays an important role in the development of self-related and social-cognitive functions that emerge during adolescence. More generally, our study demonstrates how quantitative multimodal analysis of anatomy and connectivity allows us to better characterize the heterogeneous development and maturation of brain networks.",

This does not only include regions subserving language production and perception, but also auditory processing and attention. We investigated resting state network connectivity of auditory, language and attention networks of patients with schizophrenia and hypothesized that patients would show reduced connectivity. Patients with schizophrenia (n=45) and healthy controls (n=30) underwent a resting state fMRI scan. Independent components analysis was used to identify networks of the auditory cortex, left inferior frontal language regions and the anterior cingulate region, associated with attention. The time courses of the components where correlated with each other, the correlations were transformed by a Fisher's Z transformation, and compared between groups. In patients with schizophrenia, we observed decreased connectivity between the auditory and language networks. Conversely, patients showed increased connectivity between the attention and language network compared to controls. There was no relationship with severity of symptoms such as auditory hallucinations. The decreased connectivity between auditory and language processing areas observed in schizophrenia patients is consistent with earlier research and may underlie language processing difficulties. Altered anterior cingulate connectivity in patients may be a correlate of habitual suppression of unintended speech, or of excessive attention to internally generated speech. This altered connectivity pattern appears to be present independent of symptom severity, and may be suggestive of a trait, rather than a state characteristic",

    abstract = "The hallmark clinical symptom of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) is episodic memory impairment. Recent functional imaging studies suggest that memory function is subserved by a set of distributed networks, which include both the medial temporal lobe (MTL) system and the set of cortical regions collectively referred to as the default network. Specific regions of the default network, in particular, the posteromedial cortices, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate, are selectively vulnerable to early amyloid deposition in AD. These regions are also thought to play a key role in both memory encoding and retrieval, and are strongly functionally connected to the MTL. Multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies during memory tasks have revealed alterations in these networks in patients with clinical AD. Similar functional abnormalities have been detected in subjects at-risk for AD, including those with genetic risk and older individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Recently, we and other groups have found evidence of functional alterations in these memory networks even among cognitively intact older individuals with occult amyloid pathology, detected by PET amyloid imaging. Taken together, these findings suggest that the pathophysiological process of AD exerts specific deleterious effects on these distributed memory circuits, even prior to clinical manifestations of significant memory impairment. Interestingly, some of the functional alterations seen in prodromal AD subjects have taken the form of increases in activity relative to baseline, rather than a loss of activity. It remains unclear whether these increases in fMRI activity may be compensatory to maintain memory performance in the setting of early AD pathology or instead, represent evidence of excitotoxicity and impending neuronal failure. Recent studies have also revealed disruption of the intrinsic connectivity of these networks observable even during the resting state in early AD and asymptomatic individuals with high amyloid burden. Research is ongoing to determine if these early network alterations will serve as sensitive predictors of clinical decline, and eventually, as markers of pharmacological response to potential disease-modifying treatments for AD.",

Non-human primate and human CNS imaging studies have identified the DMN in these two species. Clinical imaging studies have shown that the pattern of activity within the DMN is often modulated in various disease states (e.g., Alzheimer's, schizophrenia or chronic pain). However, whether the DMN exists in awake rodents has not been characterized. The current data provides evidence that awake rodents also possess 'DMN-like' functional connectivity, but only subsequent to habituation to what is initially a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment as well as physical restraint. Specifically, the habituation process spanned across four separate scanning sessions (Day 2, 4, 6 and 8). At Day 8, significant (p<0.05) functional connectivity was observed amongst structures such as the anterior cingulate (seed region), retrosplenial, parietal, and hippocampal cortices. Prior to habituation (Day 2), functional connectivity was only detected (p<0.05) amongst CNS structures known to mediate anxiety (i.e., anterior cingulate (seed region), posterior hypothalamic area, amygdala and parabracial nucleus). In relating functional connectivity between cingulate-default-mode and cingulate-anxiety structures across Days 2-8, a significant inverse relationship (r = -0.65, p = 0.0004) was observed between these two functional interactions such that increased cingulate-DMN connectivity corresponded to decreased cingulate anxiety network connectivity. This investigation demonstrates that the cingulate is an important component of both the rodent DMN-like and anxiety networks",

The aim of this study was to determine which method of data processing provides highest diagnostic power and to define metrics to further optimize the diagnostic value. fMRI was acquired in 21 healthy subjects, 17 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and data evaluated both with volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course evaluations and independent component analyses (ICA). The first approach determines the amount of DMN region interconnectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients); the second method determines the magnitude of DMN coactivation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping was available in 41 of the subjects examined. Diagnostic power (expressed as accuracy) of data of a single DMN region in independent component analyses was 64\%, that of a single correlation of time courses between 2 DMN regions was 71\%, respectively. With multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis and data from various regions, accuracy could be increased to 97\% (sensitivity 100\%, specificity 95\%). In nondemented subjects, no significant differences in activity within DMN could be detected comparing ApoE $\epsilon$4 allele carriers and ApoE $\epsilon$4 allele noncarriers. However, there were some indications that fMRI might yield useful information given a larger sample. Time course correlation analyses seem to outperform independent component analyses in the identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis by considering the activity of various parts of the DMN as well as the interconnectivity between these regions are required to achieve optimal and clinically acceptable diagnostic power",

The sequence of events leading up to dementia has been hypothesized to begin many years or decades before any clinical symptoms occur. Here we review the findings across rs-fMRI studies in the spectrum of preclinical AD to clinical AD.

    abstract = "In recent years, graph theory has been successfully applied to study functional and anatomical connectivity networks in the human brain. Most of these networks have shown small-world topological characteristics: high efficiency in long distance communication between nodes, combined with highly interconnected local clusters of nodes. Moreover, functional studies performed at high resolutions have presented convincing evidence that resting-state functional connectivity networks exhibits (exponentially truncated) scale-free behavior. Such evidence, however, was mostly presented qualitatively, in terms of linear regressions of the degree distributions on log-log plots. Even when quantitative measures were given, these were usually limited to the r(2) correlation coefficient. However, the r(2) statistic is not an optimal estimator of explained variance, when dealing with (truncated) power-law models. Recent developments in statistics have introduced new non-parametric approaches, based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, for the problem of model selection. In this work, we have built on this idea to statistically tackle the issue of model selection for the degree distribution of functional connectivity at rest. The analysis, performed at voxel level and in a subject-specific fashion, confirmed the superiority of a truncated power-law model, showing high consistency across subjects. Moreover, the most highly connected voxels were found to be consistently part of the default mode network. Our results provide statistically sound support to the evidence previously presented in literature for a truncated power-law model of resting-state functional connectivity.",

Functional connectivity as measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a useful tool for studying disease effects on baseline states of neuronal networks. In this study, we use high resolution MRI to label subregions within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a site of early pathology in AD, and report an increase in functional connectivity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment between entorhinal cortex and subregions of the MTL, with the strongest effect in the anterior hippocampus. However, our data also replicated the effects of decreased connectivity of the MTL to other nodes of the default mode network reported by other researchers. This dissociation of changes in functional connectivity within the MTL versus the MTL's connection with other neocortical structures can help enrich the characterization of early stages of disease progression in AD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

    abstract = "A better understanding of how behavioral performance emerges from interacting brain systems may come from analysis of functional networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies comparing such networks with human behavior have begun to identify these relationships, but few have used a time scale small enough to relate their findings to variation within a single individual's behavior. In the present experiment we examined the relationship between a psychomotor vigilance task and the interacting default mode and task positive networks. Two time-localized comparative metrics were calculated: difference between the two networks' signals at various time points around each instance of the stimulus (peristimulus times) and correlation within a 12.3-s window centered at each peristimulus time. Correlation between networks was also calculated within entire resting-state functional imaging runs from the same individuals. These metrics were compared with response speed on both an intraindividual and an interindividual basis. In most cases, a greater difference or more anticorrelation between networks was significantly related to faster performance. While interindividual analysis showed this result generally, using intraindividual analysis it was isolated to peristimulus times 4 to 8 s before the detected target. Within that peristimulus time span, the effect was stronger for individuals who tended to have faster response times. These results suggest that the relationship between functional networks and behavior can be better understood by using shorter time windows and also by considering both intraindividual and interindividual variability.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although body image disturbance is considered one of the core characteristics of anorexia nervosa (AN), the exact nature of this complex feature is poorly understood. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies can only partially explore the multimodal complexity of body consciousness, which is a complex cognition underpinned by aspects of visual perception, proprioception, and touch. The aim of the present study was to explore the functional connectivity of networks involved in visuospatial and somatosensory processing in AN. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with AN, 16 women who had recovered from it, and 26 healthy women underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan and neuropsychological assessment of their visuospatial abilities using the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. RESULTS: Both AN groups showed areas of decreased connectivity in the ventral visual network, a network involved in the "what?" pathway of visual perception. Even more interestingly, the AN group, but not the recovered AN group, displayed increased coactivation in the left parietal cortex, encompassing the somatosensory cortex, in an area implicated in long-term multimodal spatial memory and representation, even in the absence of visual information. A neuropsychological assessment of visuospatial abilities revealed that aspects of detail processing and global integration (central coherence) showed correlations with connectivity of this brain area in the AN group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that AN is associated with double disruption of brain connectivity, which shows a specific association with visuospatial difficulties and may explain the failure of the integration process between visual and somatosensory perceptual information that might sustain body image disturbance},

We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine potential amygdala-PFC functional connectivity abnormalities in treatment-naive subjects with MDD. METHODS: Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 28 individuals with MDD and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Amygdala-PFC functional connectivity was compared between the MDD and HC groups. RESULTS: Decreased functional connectivity to the left ventral PFC (VPFC) from the left and right amygdala was observed in the MDD group, compared with the HC group (p < 0.05, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment-naive subjects with MDD showed decreased functional connectivity from the amygdala to the VPFC, especially to the left VPFC. This suggests that these connections may play an important role in the neuropathophysiology of MDD at its onset",

Data was analyzed using both the rCCA method and the General Linear Model (GLM). A modified Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method was used to evaluate the performance of the different analysis methods. The area under a fraction of the ROC curve was used as a measure of performance. On resting state data the fraction of voxels above certain significance thresholds were used to evaluate the significance estimation method.RESULTS:The rCCA method scored significantly higher on the area under the ROC curve than the GLM. The fraction of activated voxels determined by thresholding according to the introduced significance estimation technique showed good agreement with the thresholds selected.CONCLUSION:The rCCA method is an effective analysis tool for fMRI data and its usability is increased with the introduced significance estimation method.",

In this study, we perform three fMRI experiments that demonstrate consistency and specialization in the default mode network. Correlated activity fluctuations of default mode network regions are identified during (i) eyes-closed spontaneous rest, (ii) activation by moral dilemma, and (iii) deactivation by Stroop task performance. Across these imaging states, striking uniformity is shown in the basic anatomy of the default mode network, but with both tasks clearly and differentially modulating this activity compared with spontaneous fluctuations of the network at rest. Against rest, moral dilemma is further shown to evoke regionally specific activity increases of hypothesized functional relevance. Mapping spontaneous and task-related brain activity will help to constrain the meaning of the default mode network. These findings are discussed in relation to recent debate on the topic of default modes of brain function},

METHODS: Fifteen healthy young volunteers received ST36 Ac and non-acupoints Ac respectively, the resting-state fMRI data were acquired before and 20 min after the withdrawal of AC. ALFF of encephalic regions were calculated using REST software, and one-sample t-test analysis was performed on the intragroup data acquired after Ac by statistical parametric mapping 5 (SPM5), to get the maps of ALFF changes induced by ST36 Ac and non-acupoints Ac respectively for analyzing the difference between them finally. RESULTS: ST36 Ac increased ALFF in widespread brain areas, including cerebral cortex (frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobe), brainstem, cerebellum, etc., with the amplitude and extent higher than those increased by non-acupoint Ac, showing statistical significance in ALEF of right cerebellar posterior lobe, fusiform gyrus, central posterior gyrus, central anterior gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, ALFF in brain areas of left temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus, mid-temporal gyrus, uncus, bilateral forepart of callosal gyrus, right amygdala, right inferior gyri orbitales were decreased by Ac, also showing significant difference between ST36 Ac and non-acupoint Ac (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ST36 Ac could induce ALFF changes in multiple functional regions of brain,and its mechanism is probably produced by modulating the respective functional center and complex network in brain to influence the target organs.",

The method simultaneously infers the templates of latent connectivity for each population and the differences in connectivity between the groups. We demonstrate our method on a schizophrenia study. Our model identifies significant increases in functional connectivity between the parietal/posterior cingulate region and the frontal lobe and reduced functional connectivity between the parietal/posterior cingulate region and the temporal lobe in schizophrenia.

    abstract = "Correlative low frequency fluctuations in functional MRI (fMRI) signals across brain regions at rest have been taken as a measure of functional connectivity to map large-scale neural networks; however, the neural origin is still not clear. Receptor-targeted pharmacological manipulation could elucidate the role of neuroreceptor systems in resting-state functional connectivity to provide another perspective on the mechanism. In this study, the dose-dependent effects of an $\alpha$(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist, medetomidine, on brain activation and functional connectivity were investigated. Forepaw stimulation-induced activation and resting-state fluctuation in the rat somatosensory cortices and caudate putamen were measured using the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI. The results showed significant dose-dependent suppression of inter-hemispheric correlation but not the amplitude in the somatosensory areas, while the stimulation-induced activation in the same areas remained unchanged. To clarify the potential change in the hemodynamic response caused by the vasoconstrictive effect of medetomidine, the resting perfusion fluctuation was studied by arterial spin labeling and showed similar results as the BOLD. This suggests that the oxygen metabolic rate and hence the neural activity may not be affected by medetomidine but only the synchrony between brain regions was suppressed. Furthermore, no change in functional connectivity with medetomidine dosages was seen in the caudate putamen, a region with much lower $\alpha$(2)-receptor density. These results indicate that resting-state signal correlation may reflect underlying neuroreceptor activity and a potential role of the adrenergic system in the functional connectivity",

    abstract = "Some promising genetic correlates of schizophrenia have emerged in recent years but none explain more than a small fraction of cases. The challenge of our time is to characterize the neuronal networks underlying schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric illnesses. Early models of schizophrenia have been limited by the ability to readily evaluate large-scale networks in living patients. With the development of resting state and advanced structural magnetic resonance imaging, it has become possible to do this. While we are at an early stage, a number of models of intrinsic brain networks have been developed to account for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This paper reviews the recent voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging literature in light of the proposed networks underlying these disorders. It is suggested that there is support for recently proposed models that suggest a pivotal role for the salience network. However, the interactions of this network with the default mode network and executive control networks are not sufficient to explain schizophrenic symptoms or distinguish them from other neuropsychiatric disorders. Alternatively, it is proposed that schizophrenia arises from a uniquely human brain network associated with directed effort including the dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), auditory cortex, and hippocampus while mood disorders arise from a different brain network associated with emotional encoding including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbital frontal cortex, and amygdala. Both interact with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a representation network including the frontal and temporal poles and the fronto-insular cortex, allowing the representation of the thoughts, feelings, and actions of self and others across time",

Using Kendall'sW, concordance of spatial maps ranged from .60 to .86 across networks, for various derived measures. The Pearson correlation coefficient for temporal coherence between networks across all Time 1-Time 2 (T1/T2) z-converted measures was .66 (p<.001). There were no differences between T1/T2 measurements in low-frequency power of the ICNs. For the visual network, within-session T1 correlated with the T2 low-frequency power, across participants. These measures from resting-state data in children were consistent across multiple domains (spatial, temporal, and frequency).

Cross-cultural effect on the brain revisited: universal structures plus writing system variation. Hum Brain Mapp. 25: 92-104). In 25 native adult readers of English, patterns of positive RSFC were consistent with patterns of task-based activity and functional connectivity associated with word reading. Moreover, conjunction analyses highlighted the posterior left inferior frontal gyrus and the posterior left middle temporal gyrus (post-LMTG) as potentially important loci of functional interaction among 5 of the 6 reading networks. The significance of the post-LMTG has typically been unappreciated in task-based studies on unimpaired readers but is frequently reported to be a locus of hypoactivity in dyslexic readers and exhibits intervention-induced changes of activity in dyslexic children. Finally, patterns of negative RSFC included not only regions of the so-called default mode network but also regions involved in effortful controlled processes, which may not be required once reading becomes automatized. In conclusion, the current study supports the utility of resting-state fMRI for investigating reading networks and has direct relevance for the understanding of reading disorders such as dyslexia.",

However the validity of fNIRS-based RSFC has rarely been studied. In the present study, fNIRS and fMRI data were simultaneously acquired from 21 subjects during the resting state. After the spatial correspondence was established between the two imaging modalities by transforming the fMRI data into fNIRS measurements space, the index of Between-Modality-Similarity (BMS) of RSFC was evaluated across multiple spatial scales. First, the RSFC between the bilateral primary motor ROI was quite similar between fNIRS and fMRI for all the subjects (BMS(ROI)=0.95±0.04 for HbO and BMS(ROI)=0.86±0.13 for HbR). Second, group-level sensorimotor RSFC maps (0.79 for HbO and 0.74 for HbR) showed higher between-modality similarity than individual-level RSFC maps (0.48±0.16 for HbO and 0.41±0.15 for HbR). Finally, for the first time, we combined fNIRS and graph theory to investigate topological properties of resting-state brain networks. The clustering coefficient (C(p)) and characteristic path length (L(p)) which are the most important network topological parameters, both showed high between-modality similarities (BMS(Cp)=0.90±0.03 for HbO and 0.90±0.06 for HbR; BMS(Lp)=0.92±0.04 for HbO and 0.91±0.05 for HbR). In summary, the converged results across all the spatial scales demonstrated that fNIRS is capable of providing comparable RSFC measures to fMRI, and thus provide direct evidence for the validity of the optical brain connectivity and the optical brain network approaches to functional brain integration during resting state",

Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether parietal-frontal functional connectivity is associated with intelligence in young children. We performed independent component analyses on resting-state fMRI data of 115 children (6-8 years old) to select seed and target regions for a seed/target region correlation analysis. We found that higher nonverbal intelligence was associated with increased functional connectivity between right parietal and right frontal regions, and between right parietal and dorsal anterior cingulate regions. The association between intelligence and functional connectivity between certain brain regions was stronger in girls than boys.

Probabilistic tractography and functional correlation analyses were performed to map connections between brain structures and to derive indices of connectivity that were then used to compare groups. Anatomical connectivity deficits were demonstrated in PD patients, specifically for sensorimotor connections. Functional deficits were also found in some of the same connections. In addition, functional connectivity was found to increase in associative and limbic connections in PD patients compared with controls. This study lends support to findings regarding the dysfunction of the sensorimotor circuit in PD. As deficits in anatomical and functional connectivity within this circuit were in some cases concordant in PD patients, a possible link between brain structure and function is suggested. Increases in functional connectivity in other cortico-basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits may be indicative of compensatory effects in response to system deficits elsewhere. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society",

Arbitrating these accounts using functional magnetic resonance imaging has previously been difficult because of magnetic susceptibility artifacts in the region. The present study used parameters optimized for imaging the ATL, and had subjects encode facts about unfamiliar people, buildings, and hammers. Using both conjunction and region of interest analyses, person-selective responses were observed in both the left and right ATL. Neither building-selective, hammer-selective nor domain-general responses were observed in the ATLs, although they were observed in other brain regions. These findings were supported by "resting-state" functional connectivity analyses using independent datasets from the same subjects. Person-selective ATL clusters were functionally connected with the brain's wider social cognition network. Rather than serving as a domain-general semantic hub, the ATLs work in unison with the social cognition system to support learning facts about others.},

While their physiological origin and implications are not fully understood, these signals are believed to reflect some types of neuronal signaling, systemic hemodynamics, and/or cerebral vascular auto-regulation processes. Here, we examine a new method of integrated processing of concurrent NIRS and fMRI data collected on six human subjects during a whole brain resting state acquisition. The method combines the high spatial resolution offered by fMRI (approximately 3mm) and the high temporal resolution offered by NIRS (approximately 80 ms) to allow for the quantitative assessment of temporal relationships between the LFOs observed at different spatial locations in fMRI data. This temporal relationship allowed us to infer that the origin of a large proportion of the LFOs is independent of the baseline neural activity. The spatio-temporal pattern of LFOs detected by NIRS and fMRI evolves temporally through the brain in a way that resembles cerebral blood flow dynamics. Our results suggest that a major component of the LFOs arise from fluctuations in the blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation at a global circulatory system level.",

We used resting-state fMRI to study basal functional connectivity within temporal lobes in medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) during interictal period. Two hundred consecutive single-shot GE-EPI acquisitions were acquired in 37 right-handed subjects (26 controls, eight patients presenting with left and three patients with right MTLE). For each hemisphere, normalized correlation coefficients were computed between pairs of time-course signals extracted from five regions involved in MTLE epileptogenic networks (Brodmann area 38, amygdala, entorhinal cortex (EC), anterior hippocampus (AntHip), and posterior hippocampus (PostHip)). In controls, an asymmetry was present with a global higher connectivity in the left temporal lobe. Relative to controls, the left MTLE group showed disruption of the left EC-AntHip link, and a trend of decreased connectivity of the left AntHip-PostHip link. In contrast, a trend of increased connectivity of the right AntHip-PostHip link was observed and was positively correlated to memory performance. At the individual level, seven out of the eight left MTLE patients showed decreased or disrupted functional connectivity. In this group, four patients with left TLE showed increased basal functional connectivity restricted to the right temporal lobe spared by seizures onset. A reverse pattern was observed at the individual level for patients with right TLE. This is the first demonstration of decreased basal functional connectivity within epileptogenic networks with concomitant contralateral increased connectivity possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms",

    abstract = "Scaling temporal dynamics in functional MRI (fMRI) signals have been evidenced for a decade as intrinsic characteristics of ongoing brain activity (Zarahn et al., 1997). Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate across brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011): notably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in activating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were obtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence focusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs) and raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation in RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling exponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on models that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic) self-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either of those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address these issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the scaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant variations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the recently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et al., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a richer and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation and Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from improved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the literature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN structures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one, using a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis (ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset comprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et al., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported task-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that it occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional networks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal at rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of multifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be considered as the key property disentangling functional networks from artifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature reporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing non-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes",

We combined fractional anisotropy measures of fiber tract integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state fMRI data obtained at 3 Tesla from 20 healthy elderly subjects (56 to 83 years of age) to determine white matter microstructure underlying default mode connectivity. We hypothesized that the functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and hippocampus from resting state fMRI data would be associated with the white matter microstructure in the cingulate bundle and fiber tracts connecting posterior cingulate gyrus with lateral temporal lobes, medial temporal lobes, and precuneus. This was demonstrated at the p<0.001 level using a voxel-based multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) approach. In addition, we used a data-driven technique of joint independent component analysis (ICA) that uncovers spatial pattern that are linked across modalities. It revealed a pattern of white matter tracts including cingulate bundle and associated fiber tracts resembling the findings from the hypothesis-driven analysis and was linked to the pattern of default mode network (DMN) connectivity in the resting state fMRI data. Our findings support the notion that the functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and hippocampus and the functional connectivity across the entire DMN is based on distinct pattern of anatomical connectivity within the cerebral white matter.",

Here we examine the effect of aging on engagement of the default network (DN) and reward network (RN) during these tasks. Previous studies have shown reduced engagement of the DN and reward areas in older adults, but the influence of age on these circuits during self-relevant tasks has not been examined. The tasks involved judging personality traits about one's self or a well known other person. There were no age differences in reaction time on the tasks but older adults had more positive Self and Other judgments, whereas younger adults had more negative judgments. Both groups had increased DN and RN activity during the self-relevant tasks, relative to non-self tasks, but this increase was reduced in older compared to young adults. Functional connectivity of both networks during the tasks was weaker in the older relative to younger adults. Intrinsic functional connectivity, measured at rest, also was weaker in the older adults in the DN, but not in the RN. These results suggest that, in younger adults, the processing of personally relevant information involves robust activation of and functional connectivity within these two networks, in line with current models that emphasize strong links between the self and reward. The finding that older adults had more positive judgments, but weaker engagement and less consistent functional connectivity in these networks, suggests potential brain mechanisms for the "positivity bias" with aging},

Using diffusion tensor imaging, we found higher WM integrity in older people who were lifelong bilinguals than in monolinguals. This maintained integrity was measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) and was found in the corpus callosum extending to the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi. We also hypothesized that stronger WM connections would be associated with more widely distributed patterns of functional connectivity in bilinguals. We tested this by assessing the resting-state functional connectivity of frontal lobe regions adjacent to WM areas with group differences in FA. Bilinguals showed stronger anterior to posterior functional connectivity compared to monolinguals. These results are the first evidence that maintained WM integrity is related to lifelong naturally occurring experience; the resulting enhanced structural and functional connectivity may provide a neural basis for "brain reserve.},

    abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often characterized by aberrant amygdala activation and functional abnormalities in corticolimbic circuitry, as elucidated by functional neuroimaging. These "activation" studies have primarily relied on tasks designed to induce region-specific, and task-dependent brain responses in limbic (e.g., amygdala) and paralimbic brain areas through the use of aversive evocative probes. It remains unknown if these corticolimbic circuit abnormalities exist at baseline or "at rest," in the absence of fear/anxiety-related provocation and outside the context of task demands. Therefore the primary aim of the present experiment was to investigate aberrant amygdala functional connectivity patterns in combat-related PTSD patients during resting-state. Seventeen Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans with combat-related PTSD (PTSD group) and 17 combat-exposed OEF/OIF veterans without PTSD [combat-exposed control (CEC) group] underwent an 8-min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Using an anatomically derived amygdala "seed" region we observed stronger functional coupling between the amygdala and insula in the PTSD group compared to the CEC group, but did not find group differences in amygdala-prefrontal connectivity. These findings suggest that the aberrant amygdala and insula activation to fear-evocative probes previously characterized in PTSD may be driven by an underlying enhanced connectivity between the amygdala, a region known for perceiving threat and generating fear responses, and the insula, a region known for processing the meaning and prediction of aversive bodily states. This enhanced amygdala-insula connectivity may reflect an exaggerated, pervasive state of arousal that exists outside the presence of an overt actual threat/danger. Studying amygdala functional connectivity "at rest" extends our understanding of the pathophysiology of PTSD},

In the present study, we examine non-homotopic regions, characterizing heterotopic RSFC and comparing it to intrahemispheric RSFC, to examine the impact of hemispheric separation on the integration and segregation of processing in the brain. Resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 59 healthy participants to examine inter-regional correlations in spontaneous low frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal. Using a probabilistic atlas, we correlated probability-weighted time series from 112 regions (56 per hemisphere) distributed throughout the entire cerebrum. We compared RSFC for pairings of non-homologous regions located in different hemispheres (heterotopic connectivity) to RSFC for the same pairings when located within hemisphere (intrahemispheric connectivity). For positive connections, connectivity strength was greater within each hemisphere, consistent with integrated intrahemispheric processing. However, for negative connections, RSFC strength was greater between the hemispheres, consistent with segregated interhemispheric processing. These patterns were particularly notable for connections involving frontal and heteromodal regions. The distribution of positive and negative connectivity was nearly identical within and between the hemispheres, though we demonstrated detailed regional variation in distribution. We discuss implications for leading models of interhemispheric interaction. The future application of our analyses may provide important insight into impaired interhemispheric processing in clinical and aging populations.",

Research in recent years has focused on assessing the reliability of FC across younger subjects within and between scan-sessions. Test-retest reliability in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has not yet been examined in older adults. In this study, we investigated age-related differences in reliability and stability of RSFC across scans. In addition, we examined how global signal regression (GSR) affects RSFC reliability and stability. Three separate resting-state scans from 29 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults (55-85 yrs) were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) dataset made publically available as part of the 1000 Functional Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000. 92 regions of interest (ROIs) with 5 cubic mm radius, derived from the default, cingulo-opercular, fronto-parietal and sensorimotor networks, were previously defined based on a recent study. Mean time series were extracted from each of the 92 ROIs from each scan and three matrices of z-transformed correlation coefficients were created for each subject, which were then used for evaluation of multi-scan reliability and stability. The young group showed higher reliability of RSFC than the old group with GSR (p-value = 0.028) and without GSR (p-value <0.001). Both groups showed a high degree of multi-scan stability of RSFC and no significant differences were found between groups. By comparing the test-retest reliability of RSFC with and without GSR across scans, we found significantly higher proportion of reliable connections in both groups without GSR, but decreased stability. Our results suggest that aging is associated with reduced reliability of RSFC which itself is highly stable within-subject across scans for both groups, and that GSR reduces the overall reliability but increases the stability in both age groups and could potentially alter group differences of RSFC",

    abstract = "Independent component analysis (ICA) of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data is usually performed over the temporal dimension: each channel is one row of the data matrix, and a linear transformation maximizing the independence of component time courses is sought. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), by contrast, most studies use spatial ICA: each time point constitutes a row of the data matrix, and independence of the spatial patterns is maximized. Here, we show the utility of spatial ICA in characterizing oscillatory neuromagnetic signals. We project the sensor data into cortical space using a standard minimum-norm estimate and apply a sparsifying transform to focus on oscillatory signals. The resulting method, spatial Fourier-ICA, provides a concise summary of the spatiotemporal and spectral content of spontaneous neuromagnetic oscillations in cortical source space over time scales of minutes. Spatial Fourier-ICA applied to resting-state and naturalistic stimulation MEG data from nine healthy subjects revealed consistent components covering the early visual, somatosensory and motor cortices with spectral peaks at ∼10 and ∼20 Hz. The proposed method seems valuable for inferring functional connectivity, stimulus-related modulation of rhythmic activity, and their commonalities across subjects from nonaveraged MEG data.

    abstract = "Graph analysis has become an increasingly popular tool for characterizing topological properties of brain connectivity networks. Within this approach, the brain is modeled as a graph comprising N nodes connected by M edges. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the nodes typically represent brain regions and the edges some measure of interaction between them. These nodes are commonly defined using a variety of regional parcellation templates, which can vary both in the volume sampled by each region, and the number of regions parcellated. Here, we sought to investigate how such variations in parcellation templates affect key graph analytic measures of functional brain organization using resting-state fMRI in 30 healthy volunteers. Seven different parcellation resolutions (84, 91, 230, 438, 890, 1314, and 4320 regions) were investigated. We found that gross inferences regarding network topology, such as whether the brain is small-world or scale-free, were robust to the template used, but that both absolute values of, and individual differences in, specific parameters such as path length, clustering, small-worldness, and degree distribution descriptors varied considerably across the resolutions studied. These findings underscore the need to consider the effect that a specific parcellation approach has on graph analytic findings in human fMRI studies, and indicate that results obtained using different templates may not be directly comparable.",

    abstract = "The early detection of major depression in elderly individuals who are at risk of developing the disease is of prime importance when it comes to the prevention of geriatric depression. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in regional homogeneity (ReHo) of spontaneous activity in late-life subthreshold depression (StD), and we evaluated the sensitivity/specificity performance of these changes. Nineteen elderly individuals with StD and 18 elderly controls underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. The ReHo approach was employed to examine whether StD was related to alterations in resting-state neural activity, in the form of abnormal regional synchronization. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and the Fisher stepwise discriminant analysis were used to evaluate the sensitivity/specificity characteristics of the ReHo index in discriminating between the StD subjects and normal controls. The results demonstrated that, compared to controls, StD subjects display lower ReHo in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left postcentral gyrus (PCG), and left middle frontal and inferior temporal gyri, as well as higher ReHo in the bilateral insula and right DLPFC. The left PCG and the right DLPFC, OFC, and posterior insula, together reported a predictive accuracy of 91.9\%. These results suggest that the regional activity coherence was changed in the resting brain of StD subjects, and that these alterations may serve as potential markers for the early detection of StD in late-life depression",

The comparison between genders showed that for the contrast of female minus male, significant difference was observed at mid-cingulate cortex; for the contrast of male minus female, significant differences were observed at left medial orbital prefrontal cortex, and uncus; right insula/operculum and prefrontal cortex.

    title = "{Abnormal functional connectivity of the default mode network in remitted late-onset depression.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: The functional neural network model has been a major method used to investigate mechanisms of neuropsychopathy. There is considerable evidence that late-onset depression (LOD) is the prodrome, or the early clinical manifestation, of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The default mode network (DMN) is one of the neural networks that can be used to explore the complex relationships between depressive symptoms, episodic memory deficits and other cognitive impairments. To date, no study has directly linked the DMN to LOD while focusing on episodic memory and the influence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for AD in LOD patients. METHODS: In total, 33 remitted LOD (rLOD) patients and 33 elderly controls underwent fMRI scanning using low-frequency BOLD signal imaging during the resting state and during an episodic memory task. Furthermore, function-based functional connectivities (FCs) in the region of interesting (ROI) (posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the DMN) were analysed to explore interactions between disease states, task states and genetic risk factors (APOE4). RESULTS: Compared to healthy control subjects (HC), the FCs between the PCC and the right medial temporal lobe of the rLOD patients were significantly stronger during rest (p<0.005) and significantly weaker (p<0.05) during performance of the task. The mode of change from rest to task performance in the HC was in contrast to the mode of change in the rLOD patients. The FCs of the rLOD patients without APOE4 were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the resting state, but the rLOD patients who carried APOE4 showed a trend toward decreased FCs. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small. While the study was cross-sectional, we did not differentiate between the various types of antidepressants the patients used, which may have had different effects on cognitive function, especially on episodic memory. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that rLOD might be the prodrome, or the early clinical manifestation, of AD and that rLOD patients with APOE4 showed an increased risk for episodic memory decline and AD",

    abstract = "Dysfunction of the corticolimbic circuitry has been highlighted in social anxiety disorder (SAD) during social stimuli. However, few studies have investigated functional connectivity in SAD during the resting state, which may improve our understanding of SAD pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether whole-brain functional connectivity might be aberrant in SAD patients, and if so, whether these changes are related to the measured clinical severity. Seventeen SAD patients and 19 healthy controls participated in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The brain was first divided into 90 paired brain regions and functional connectivity was then estimated by temporal correlation between each of these regions. Furthermore, connections that were significantly disrupted in SAD patients were correlated with clinical severity measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Compared with healthy controls, SAD patients showed decreased positive connections within the frontal lobe and decreased negative connections between the frontal and occipital lobes. In particular, the weaker negative connections between the frontal lobe, which mainly involved the right median prefrontal cortex, and the occipital lobe had a significant positive correlation with the severity of SAD symptoms. The results support the hypothesis that some abnormalities of functional connectivity exist in SAD patients, which relate to the frontal cortex and occipital cortex. In addition, decreased functional connectivity between the frontal and occipital lobes and within the frontal lobe might be related to abnormal information processing and reflect disturbed neural organization resulting in defective social cognition, which could represent an early imaging biomarker for SAD.",

A number of studies have proposed using resting-state BOLD data to parcellate the brain into functional subunits. In this work, we present two state-of-the-art graph-based partitioning approaches, and investigate their application to the problem of brain network segmentation using resting-state fMRI. The two approaches, the normalized cut (Ncut) and the modularity detection algorithm, are also compared to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach. We show that the Ncut approach performs consistently better than the modularity detection approach, and it also outperforms the GMM approach for in vivo fMRI data. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 43 healthy subjects, and the Ncut algorithm was used to parcellate several different cortical regions of interest. The group-wise delineation of the functional subunits based on resting-state fMRI was highly consistent with the parcellation results from two task-based fMRI studies (one with 18 subjects and the other with 20 subjects). The findings suggest that whole-brain parcellation of the cortex using resting-state fMRI is feasible, and that the Ncut algorithm provides the appropriate technique for this task.",

Group independent-component analysis and the BN learning approach were used, respectively, to separate the RSNs and construct the network-to-network connectivity patterns for each group. The convergence index for the special network DMN was measured.RESULTS:Three of the 4 connections were significantly lower in AD compared with NC. Although numerically the AD group had more connections, none was statistically different from that in the NC group except for 1 increased connection from the DMN to the DAN. The convergence index for the DMN node was lower in AD than in NC.CONCLUSIONS:Connections among cognitive networks in AD were more vulnerable to impairment than sensory networks. The DMN decreased its integration function for other RSNs but may also play a role in compensating for the disrupted connections in AD",

Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain these sensations [3, 4], yet without direct, objective measures, the cause is unknown. We found that all of our healthy human subjects developed a robust nystagmus while simply lying in the static magnetic field of an MRI machine. Patients lacking labyrinthine function did not. We use the pattern of eye movements as a measure of vestibular stimulation to show that the stimulation is static (continuous, proportional to static magnetic field strength, requiring neither head movement nor dynamic change in magnetic field strength) and directional (sensitive to magnetic field polarity and head orientation). Our calculations and geometric model suggest that magnetic vestibular stimulation (MVS) derives from a Lorentz force resulting from interaction between the magnetic field and naturally occurring ionic currents in the labyrinthine endolymph fluid. This force pushes on the semicircular canal cupula, leading to nystagmus. We emphasize that the unique, dual role of endolymph in the delivery of both ionic current and fluid pressure, coupled with the cupula's function as a pressure sensor, makes magnetic-field-induced nystagmus and vertigo possible. Such effects could confound functional MRI studies of brain behavior, including resting-state brain activity.",

During fMRI, a mechanic device was used to move the subject's index and middle fingers. We assessed four movement conditions (unimanual left/right, bimanual symmetric/asymmetric), plus Rest. A conventional intra-regional analysis identified the passive stimulation network, including motor cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, plus the cerebellum. The posterior (sensory) part of the sensory-motor activation around the central sulcus showed a significant modulation according to the symmetry of the bimanual movement, with greater activation for asymmetric compared to symmetric movements. A second set of fMRI analyses assessed condition-dependent changes of coupling between sensory-motor regions around the superior central sulcus and the rest of the brain. These analyses showed a high inter-regional covariation within the entire network activated by passive movement. However, the specific experimental conditions modulated these patterns of connectivity. Highest coupling was observed during the Rest condition, and the coupling between homologous sensory-motor regions around the left and right central sulcus was higher in bimanual than unimanual conditions. These findings demonstrate that passive movement can affect the connectivity within the sensory-motor network. We conclude that implicit detection of asymmetry during bimanual movement relies on associative somatosensory region in post-central areas, and that passive stimulation reduces the functional connectivity within the passive movement network. Our findings open the possibility to combine passive movement and inter-regional connectivity as a tool to investigate the functionality of the sensory-motor system in patients with very poor mobility",

Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with HIPAA regulations. Twenty-three patients with MTBI who had posttraumatic symptoms shortly after injury (<2 months) and 18 age-matched healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3 T to characterize the DMN by using ICA methods, including a single-participant ICA on the basis of a comprehensive template from core seeds in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) nodes. ICA z images of DMN components were compared between the two groups and correlated with neurocognitive tests and clinical performance in patients by using Pearson and Spearman rank correlation. Results: When compared with the control subjects, there was significantly reduced connectivity in the PCC and parietal regions and increased frontal connectivity around the MPFC in patients with MTBI (P < .01). These frontoposterior opposing changes within the DMN were significantly correlated (r = -0.44, P = .03). The reduced posterior connectivity correlated positively with neurocognitive dysfunction (eg, cognitive flexibility), while the increased frontal connectivity correlated negatively with posttraumatic symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and postconcussion syndrome). Conclusion: These results showed abnormal DMN connectivity patterns in patients with MTBI, which may provide insight into how neuronal communication and information integration are disrupted among DMN key structures after mild head injury. © RSNA, 2012",

When a person is not actively engaged in a goal-directed task, spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals can reveal functionally connected brain networks, including the so-called default mode network (DMN). To date, only a few studies have investigated DMN functions in aMCI populations. In this study, group-independent component analysis was conducted for resting-state fMRI data, with slices acquired perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus, from eight subjects with aMCI and eight normal control subjects. Subjects with aMCI showed an increased DMN activity in middle cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and left inferior parietal cortex compared to the normal control group. Decreased DMN activity for the aMCI group compared to the normal control group was noted in lateral prefrontal cortex, left medial temporal lobe (MTL), left medial temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex/retrosplenial cortex/precuneus and right angular gyrus. Although MTL volume difference between the two groups was not statistically significant, a decreased activity in left MTL was observed for the aMCI group. Positive correlations between the DMN activity and memory scores were noted for left lateral prefrontal cortex, left medial temporal gyrus and right angular gyrus. These findings support the premise that alterations of the DMN occur in aMCI and may indicate deficiencies in functional, intrinsic brain architecture that correlate with memory function, even before significant MTL atrophy is detectable by structural MRI",

Neuropsychological testing and conventional neuroimaging techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to detect these changes, which adds to the complexity and difficulty in relating symptoms from mTBI to their underlying structural or functional deficits. With the inability of traditional brain imaging techniques to properly assess the severity of brain damage induced by mTBI, there is hope that more advanced neuroimaging applications will be more sensitive, as well as specific, in accurately assessing mTBI. In this study, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the default mode network (DMN) in the subacute phase of mTBI. Fourteen concussed student-athletes who were asymptomatic based upon clinical symptoms resolution and clearance for aerobic exercise by medical professionals were scanned using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nine additional asymptomatic yet not medically cleared athletes were recruited to investigate the effect of a single episode of mTBI versus multiple mTBIs on the resting state DMN. In concussed individuals the resting state DMN showed a reduced number of connections and strength of connections in the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices. An increased number of connections and strength of connections was seen in the medial prefrontal cortex. Connections between the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and left lateral parietal cortex showed a significant reduction in magnitude as the number of concussions increased. Regression analysis also indicated an overall loss of connectivity as the number of mTBI episodes increased. Our findings indicate that alterations in the brain resting state default mode network in the subacute phase of injury may be of use clinically in assessing the severity of mTBI and offering some insight into the pathophysiology of the disorder.",

We participated in the 2011 ADHD-200 Global Competition which involved analyzing a large dataset of 973 participants including Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and healthy controls. Each participant's data included a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan as well as personal characteristic and diagnostic data. The goal was to learn a machine learning classifier that used a participant's resting state fMRI scan to diagnose (classify) that individual into one of three categories: healthy control, ADHD combined (ADHD-C) type, or ADHD inattentive (ADHD-I) type. We used participants' personal characteristic data (site of data collection, age, gender, handedness, performance IQ, verbal IQ, and full scale IQ), without any fMRI data, as input to a logistic classifier to generate diagnostic predictions. Surprisingly, this approach achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (62.52\%) as well as the highest score (124 of 195) of any of the 21 teams participating in the competition. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for differences in age, gender, and other personal characteristics in imaging diagnostics research. We discuss further implications of these results for fMRI-based diagnosis as well as fMRI-based clinical research. We also document our tests with a variety of imaging-based diagnostic methods, none of which performed as well as the logistic classifier using only personal characteristic data",

    abstract = "A number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reported the existence of default mode network (DMN) and its disruption due to the presence of a disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this investigation, first, we used the independent component analysis (ICA) technique to confirm the DMN difference between patients with AD and normal control (NC) reported in previous studies. Consistent with the previous studies, the decreased resting-state functional connectivity of DMN in AD was identified in posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), inferior temporal cortex (ITC), and hippocampus (HC). Moreover, we introduced Bayesian network (BN) to study the effective connectivity of DMN and the difference between AD and NC. When compared the DMN effective connectivity in AD with the one in NC using a nonparametric random permutation test, we found that connections from left HC to left IPC, left ITC to right HC, right HC to left IPC, to MPFC and to PCC were all lost. In addition, in AD group, the connection directions between right HC and left HC, between left HC and left ITC, and between right IPC and right ITC were opposite to those in NC group. The connections of right HC to other regions, except left HC, within the BN were all statistically in-distinguishable from 0, suggesting an increased right hippocampal pathological and functional burden in AD. The altered effective connectivity in patients with AD may reveal more characteristics of the disease and may serve as a potential biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    abstract = {The network architecture of functional connectivity within the human brain connectome is poorly understood at the voxel level. Here, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 1003 healthy adults, we investigate a broad array of network centrality measures to provide novel insights into connectivity within the whole-brain functional network (i.e., the functional connectome). We first assemble and visualize the voxel-wise (4 mm) functional connectome as a functional network. We then demonstrate that each centrality measure captures different aspects of connectivity, highlighting the importance of considering both global and local connectivity properties of the functional connectome. Beyond "detecting functional hubs," we treat centrality as measures of functional connectivity within the brain connectome and demonstrate their reliability and phenotypic correlates (i.e., age and sex). Specifically, our analyses reveal age-related decreases in degree centrality, but not eigenvector centrality, within precuneus and posterior cingulate regions. This implies that while local or (direct) connectivity decreases with age, connections with hub-like regions within the brain remain stable with age at a global level. In sum, these findings demonstrate the nonredundancy of various centrality measures and raise questions regarding their underlying physiological mechanisms that may be relevant to the study of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. © 2011 The Author.},

    title = "{Recursive cluster elimination based support vector machine for disease state prediction using resting state functional and effective brain connectivity.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Brain state classification has been accomplished using features such as voxel intensities, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, as inputs to efficient classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM) and is based on the spatial localization model of brain function. With the advent of the connectionist model of brain function, features from brain networks may provide increased discriminatory power for brain state classification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we introduce a novel framework where in both functional connectivity (FC) based on instantaneous temporal correlation and effective connectivity (EC) based on causal influence in brain networks are used as features in an SVM classifier. In order to derive those features, we adopt a novel approach recently introduced by us called correlation-purged Granger causality (CPGC) in order to obtain both FC and EC from fMRI data simultaneously without the instantaneous correlation contaminating Granger causality. In addition, statistical learning is accelerated and performance accuracy is enhanced by combining recursive cluster elimination (RCE) algorithm with the SVM classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of the CPGC-based RCE-SVM approach using a specific instance of brain state classification exemplified by disease state prediction. Accordingly, we show that this approach is capable of predicting with 90.3\% accuracy whether any given human subject was prenatally exposed to cocaine or not, even when no significant behavioral differences were found between exposed and healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The framework adopted in this work is quite general in nature with prenatal cocaine exposure being only an illustrative example of the power of this approach. In any brain state classification approach using neuroimaging data, including the directional connectivity information may prove to be a performance enhancer. When brain state classification is used for disease state prediction, our approach may aid the clinicians in performing more accurate diagnosis of diseases in situations where in non-neuroimaging biomarkers may be unable to perform differential diagnosis with certainty.",

Here, we addressed the question whether and how spontaneous neuronal activity in the striatum is altered in schizophrenia. We therefore assessed intrinsic striatal activity and its relation with disorder states and symptom dimensions in patients with schizophrenia. We performed resting-state functional (rs-fMRI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging as well as psychometric assessment in 21 schizophrenic patients during psychosis. On average 9 months later, we acquired follow-up data during psychotic remission and with comparable levels of antipsychotic medication. Twenty-one age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in the study. Independent component analysis of fMRI data yielded spatial maps and time-courses of coherent ongoing blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal fluctuations, which were used for group comparisons and correlation analyses with scores of the positive and negative syndrome scale. During psychosis, coherent intrinsic activity of the striatum was increased in the dorsal part and correlated with positive symptoms such as delusion and hallucination. In psychotic remission of the same patients, activity of the ventral striatum was increased and correlated with negative symptoms such as emotional withdrawal and blunted affect. Results were controlled for volumetric and medication effects. These data provide first evidence that in schizophrenia intrinsic activity is changed in the striatum and corresponds to disorder states and symptom dimensions",

Therefore, we attempted to validate the usefulness of resting-state functional connectivity analysis in assessing memory function and its neural correlation with the mammillothalamic tract in patients recovering from Wernicke's encephalopathy. Seven chronic alcoholics recovering from Wernicke's encephalopathy, 14 alcoholic comparisons without Wernicke's encephalopathy, and 14 healthy comparisons underwent functional connectivity MRI scans, as well as verbal and non-verbal memory tests after at least a 1 month abstinence from alcohol. Resting-state functional connectivity strength between the anterior thalamus and the mammillary bodies was investigated by calculating temporal correlations in magnetic resonance signal levels between the two regions during a 5-min passive viewing task. The mean values of the functional connectivity strength between the left anterior thalamus and the ipsilateral mammillary body differed significantly between Wernicke's encephalopathy patients and healthy comparisons (P = 0.014). This connectivity strength in alcoholic comparisons fell between those of the former two groups, with a significant difference from that of healthy comparisons (P = 0.038). In addition, the strength of this left-sided functional connectivity significantly correlated with delayed verbal recall scores (r = 0.771, P = 0.042) and verbal recognition score (r = 0.825, P = 0.022) in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Our findings indicate that memory function in patients recovering from Wernicke's encephalopathy parallels the level of the mammillothalamic functional connectivity; this supports the usefulness of resting-state functional connectivity analysis as a practical alternative to pathological examination of the mammillothalamic tract in living patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy.",

Resting state fMRI was performed using a GE 3T scanner by collecting 200 volumes of echo-planar imaging (EPI) images with subjects relaxed, eyes closed. Data were processed using a modification of the method of Fransson (Hum Brain Mapp 2005;26:15-29), which reveals information on regional low-frequency Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal oscillations in the resting state without any a priori hypothesis. The significant active areas in brain were identified with both individual and group analysis.RESULTS:Controls showed active regions in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), theregions associated with the brain "default mode." Similar active regions were observed in PS, whereas GS showed no significant activation of precuneus/PCC.CONCLUSION:In GS, the lack of activation in precuneus/PCC may partly account for their more severe interictal deficits, compared to PS, in cognitive functions such as concentration and memory.},

In the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit mnemonic demands, robust correlations were observed between activity in the HF and several parietal regions (including precuneus, posterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule). These HF-correlated regions in parietal cortex were spatially distinct from those correlated with the motion-sensitive MT+ complex. Reanalysis of event-related fMRI studies of recognition memory showed that the regions spontaneously correlated with the HF (but not MT+) were also modulated during directed recollection. These regions showed greater activity to successfully recollected items as compared with other trial types. Together, these results associate specific regions of parietal cortex that are sensitive to successful recollection with the HF.",

Here we collected two RS-fMRI sessions, one before and another after an episodic memory encoding task, from two groups of healthy young adults, one with apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$2/$\epsilon$3 and the other with APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4. The ratio of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal, of the two sessions was used as an index of memory-consolidation. APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4 group showed greater ReHo ratio within the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The ReHo ratio in MTL was significantly correlated with the recognition memory performance in the APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4 group but not in $\epsilon$2/$\epsilon$3 group. Additionally, APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4 group showed lower ReHo ratio in the occipital and parietal picture-encoding areas. Our results indicate that APOE $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4 group may have a different off-line memory consolidation process compared to $\epsilon$2/$\epsilon$3 group.

Here, we examined whether these large-scale network dynamics can be influenced by unconscious cognitive information processing. Volunteers saw instructions (cues) to respond either ipsilaterally or contralaterally to a subsequent lateralized target. Unbeknownst to them, each cue was preceded by a masked stimulus (prime), which could be identical (congruent), or opposite (incongruent) to the cue, or neutral (not an instruction). Behaviorally, incongruent primes interfered with performance, even though they were not consciously perceived. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, we individuated the anticorrelated ENs and DMNs involved during task execution. With effective connectivity analyses, we found that DMNs caused activity in ENs throughout the task. Unconscious interference during incongruent trials was associated with a specific activity increase in ENs and an activity drop in DMNs. Intersubject efficiency in performance during incongruent trials was correlated with functional connectivity between specific ENs and DMNs. These results indicate that unconscious instructions can prime activity in ENs and DMNs and suggest that the DMNs play a key role in unconscious monitoring of the environment in the service of efficient resource allocation for task execution",

In the patients a correlation analysis related the mPFC aberrant BOLD high-frequency dynamics to altered functional connectivity to pain signaling/modulating brain regions, thus linking BOLD frequency changes to function. We also found that increased frequency fluctuations within the mPFC were temporally synchronous with spontaneous pain changes in patients during a pain-rating task. These observations provide novel insights about the nature of CBP, identifying how it disturbs the resting brain, and link high-frequency BOLD oscillations to perception.",

METHOD: Thirty patients with a first episode of non-affective functional psychosis and 28 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of the n-back working memory task. Voxel-based analyses of brain activations and deactivations were carried out and compared between groups. The connectivity of regions of significant difference between the patients and controls was also examined. RESULTS: The first-episode patients did not show significant prefrontal hypo- or hyperactivation compared to controls. However, they showed failure of deactivation in the medial frontal cortex. This area showed high levels of connectivity with the posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and parts of the parietal cortex bilaterally. Failure of deactivation was significantly greater in first-episode patients who had or went on to acquire a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia than in those who did not, and in those who met RDC criteria for schizophrenia compared to those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: First-episode psychosis is not characterized by hypo- or hyperfrontality but instead by a failure of deactivation in the medial frontal cortex. The location and connectivity of this area suggest that it is part of the default mode network. The failure of deactivation seems to be particularly marked in first-episode patients who have, or progress to, schizophrenia",

    abstract = {The cerebellum plays a role in a wide variety of complex behaviors. In order to better understand the role of the cerebellum in human behavior, it is important to know how this structure interacts with cortical and other subcortical regions of the brain. To date, several studies have investigated the cerebellum using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI; Krienen and Buckner, 2009; O'Reilly et al., 2010; Buckner et al., 2011). However, none of this work has taken an anatomically-driven lobular approach. Furthermore, though detailed maps of cerebral cortex and cerebellum networks have been proposed using different network solutions based on the cerebral cortex (Buckner et al., 2011), it remains unknown whether or not an anatomical lobular breakdown best encompasses the networks of the cerebellum. Here, we used fcMRI to create an anatomically-driven connectivity atlas of the cerebellar lobules. Timecourses were extracted from the lobules of the right hemisphere and vermis. We found distinct networks for the individual lobules with a clear division into "motor" and "non-motor" regions. We also used a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm to parcellate the cerebellum. This allowed us to investigate redundancy and independence of the anatomically identified cerebellar networks. We found that while anatomical boundaries in the anterior cerebellum provide functional subdivisions of a larger motor grouping defined using our SOM algorithm, in the posterior cerebellum, the lobules were made up of sub-regions associated with distinct functional networks. Together, our results indicate that the lobular boundaries of the human cerebellum are not necessarily indicative of functional boundaries, though anatomical divisions can be useful. Additionally, driving the analyses from the cerebellum is key to determining the complete picture of functional connectivity within the structure},

In the present work similar alterations are demonstrated for spontaneous resting patterns of fMRI brain activity over a population of CBP patients (n=12, 29-67 years old, mean=51.2). Results show abnormal correlations of three out of four highly connected sites of the DMN with bilateral insular cortex and regions in the middle frontal gyrus (p<0.05), in comparison with a control group of healthy subjects (n=20, 21-60 years old, mean=38.4). The alterations were confirmed by the calculation of triggered averages, which demonstrated increased coactivation of the DMN and the former regions. These findings demonstrate that CBP disrupts normal activity in the DMN even during the brain resting state, highlighting the impact of enduring pain over brain structure and function.",

    abstract = {The developmental cognitive neuroscience literature has grown exponentially over the last decade. This paper reviews the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature on brain function development of typically late developing functions of cognitive and motivation control, timing and attention as well as of resting state neural networks. Evidence shows that between childhood and adulthood, concomitant with cognitive maturation, there is progressively increased functional activation in task-relevant lateral and medial frontal, striatal and parieto-temporal brain regions that mediate these higher level control functions. This is accompanied by progressively stronger functional inter-regional connectivity within task-relevant fronto-striatal and fronto-parieto-temporal networks. Negative age associations are observed in earlier developing posterior and limbic regions, suggesting a shift with age from the recruitment of "bottom-up" processing regions towards "top-down" fronto-cortical and fronto-subcortical connections, leading to a more mature, supervised cognition. The resting state fMRI literature further complements this evidence by showing progressively stronger deactivation with age in anti-correlated task-negative resting state networks, which is associated with better task performance. Furthermore, connectivity analyses during the resting state show that with development increasingly stronger long-range connections are being formed, for example, between fronto-parietal and fronto-cerebellar connections, in both task-positive networks and in task-negative default mode networks, together with progressively lesser short-range connections, suggesting progressive functional integration and segregation with age. Overall, evidence suggests that throughout development between childhood and adulthood, there is progressive refinement and integration of both task-positive fronto-cortical and fronto-subcortical activation and task-negative deactivation, leading to a more mature and controlled cognition},

We took the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to be the seed region and investigated correlations across subjects between the score of the DT test and the strength of rFC between the mPFC and other brain regions. Our results showed that the strength of rFC with the mPFC significantly and positively correlated with creativity as measured by the DT test in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). These results showed that higher creativity measured by DT is associated with rFC between the mPFC and the PCC, the key nodes of the default mode network (DMN). Increased rFC between these regions is completely opposite from that is generally expected from the association between higher creativity and reduced deactivation in DMN during an externally directed attention-demanding task shown in our previous study but is similar to the pattern seen in relatives of schizophrenia. These findings are comparable to the previously reported psychological associations between schizotypy and creativity",

    abstract = "The most important quest of cognitive neuroscience may be to unravel the mechanisms by which the brain selects, links, consolidates, and integrates new information into its neuronal network, while preventing saturation to occur. During the past decade, neuroscientists working within several disciplines have observed an important involvement of the specific types of brain oscillations that occur during sleep-the cortical slow oscillations; during the resting state - the fMRI resting state networks including the default-mode network (DMN); and during task performance - the performance modulations that link as well to modulations in electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography frequency content. Understanding the role of these slow oscillations thus appears to be essential for our fundamental understanding of brain function. Brain activity is characterized by oscillations occurring in spike frequency, field potentials or blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signals. Environmental stimuli, reaching the brain through our senses, activate or inactivate neuronal populations and modulate ongoing activity. The effect they sort is to a large extent determined by the momentary state of the slow endogenous oscillations of the brain. In the absence of sensory input, as is the case during rest or sleep, brain activity does not cease. Rather, its oscillations continue and change with respect to their dominant frequencies and coupling topography. This chapter briefly introduces the topics that will be addressed in this dedicated volume of Progress in Brain Research on slow oscillations and sets the stage for excellent papers discussing their molecular, cellular, network physiological and cognitive performance aspects. Getting to know about slow oscillations is essential for our understanding of plasticity, memory, brain structure from synapse to DMN, cognition, consciousness, and ultimately for our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of sleep and vigilance.",

    abstract = {Background: Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with impairments in decision-making, empathy, and impulsivity. Recent brain imaging studies suggest that psychopathy is associated with abnormalities in limbic/paralimbic brain regions. To date, no studies have examined functional brain connectivity measures using independent component analyses (ICA) in adults with psychopathy. Here, we test hypotheses regarding paralimbic connectivity in adult incarcerated individuals stratified by psychopathy scores. Methods: One hundred and two prison inmates were rated using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). FMRI data were collected while subjects performed an auditory target detection "oddball" task. FMRI data were analyzed using group ICA to identify functional networks responding to the oddball task correlating with psychopathy scores. Results: Components demonstrating significant correlations with psychopathy included a default mode network, a frontoparietal component, and a visual/posterior cingulate component. Modulation trends correlated strongly with factor 2 (impulsivity) and total PCL-R scores in the frontoparietal and visual/posterior cingulate networks, and with factor 1 (affective) scores within the default mode network. The posterior cingulate region factored significantly in the modulation trends observed. Conclusion: Consistent with the hypothesis of limbic/paralimbic abnormalities associated with psychopathy, modulation trends correlated strongly with PCL-R scores. There is strong evidence to implicate the posterior cingulate in aberrant functional connectivity associated with the manifestation of psychopathic symptoms. Future investigations comparing functional trends associated with the posterior cingulate in psychopathic subjects may provide further insight into the manifestation of this disorder.

The aim of our study was to explore the neural correlates of resting state by providing behavioral and neuroimaging data from healthy volunteers. With no a priori assumptions, we first determined behaviorally the relationship between external and internal awareness in 31 subjects. We found a significant anticorrelation between external and internal awareness with a mean switching frequency of 0.05 Hz (range: 0.01-0.1 Hz). Interestingly, this frequency is similar to BOLD fMRI slow oscillations. We then evaluated 22 healthy volunteers in an fMRI paradigm looking for brain areas where BOLD activity correlated with "internal" and "external" scores. Activation of precuneus/posterior cingulate, anterior cingulate/mesiofrontal cortices, and parahippocampal areas ("intrinsic system") was linearly linked to intensity of internal awareness, whereas activation of lateral fronto-parietal cortices ("extrinsic system") was linearly associated with intensity of external awareness.},

We sought to investigate functional disintegration during rest because an intrinsic functional brain organization, including both "task-negative" (i.e., "default mode") and "task-positive" networks, has been suggested to play an important role in integrating ongoing information processing. Additionally, the brain regions that are involved in the intrinsic organization are believed to be abnormal in schizophrenia. Patients with paranoid schizophrenia (N=18) and healthy volunteers (N=18) underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. Functional connectivity analysis was used to identify the connectivity between each pair of brain regions within this intrinsic organization, and differences were examined in patients versus healthy volunteers. Compared to healthy volunteers, patients showed significant differences in connectivity within networks and between networks, most notably in the connectivities associated with the bilateral dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the lateral parietal region, the inferior temporal gyrus of the "task-negative" network and with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right dorsal premotor cortex of the "task-positive" network. These results suggested that the interregional functional connectivities in the intrinsic organization are altered in patients with paranoid schizophrenia.

    abstract = "Purpose: In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) the epileptogenic area is confined to the mesial temporal lobe, but other cortical and subcortical areas are also affected and cognitive and psychiatric impairments are usually documented. Functional connectivity methods are based on the correlation of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal between brain regions, which exhibit consistent and reproducible functional networks from resting state data. The aim of this study is to compare functional connectivity of patients with MTLE during the interictal period with healthy subjects. We hypothesize that patients show reduced functional connectivity compared to controls, the interest being to determine which regions show this reduction. Methods: We selected electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) resting state data without EEG spikes from 16 patients with right and 7 patients with left MTLE. EEG-fMRI resting state data of 23 healthy subjects matched for age, sex, and manual preference were selected as controls. Four volumes of interest in the left and right amygdalae and hippocampi (LA, RA, LH, and RH) were manually segmented in the anatomic MRI of each subject. The averaged BOLD time course within each volume of interest was used to detect brain regions with BOLD signal correlated with it. Group differences between patients and controls were estimated. Key Findings: In patients with right MTLE, group difference functional connectivity maps (RMTLE - controls) showed for RA and RH decreased connectivity with the brain areas of the default mode network (DMN), the ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions, and contralateral mesial temporal structures; and for LA and LH, decreased connectivity with DMN and contralateral hippocampus. Additional decreased connectivity was found between LA and pons and between LH and ventromesial limbic prefrontal structures. In patients with left MTLE, functional connectivity maps (LMTLE - controls) showed for LA and LH decreased connectivity with DMN, contralateral hippocampus, and bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions; no change in connectivity was detected for RA; and for RH, there was decreased connectivity with DMN, bilateral ventromesial limbic prefrontal regions, and contralateral amygdala and hippocampus. Significance: In unilateral MTLE, amygdala and hippocampus on the affected and to a lesser extent on the healthy side are less connected, and are also less connected with the dopaminergic mesolimbic and the DMNs. Changes in functional connectivity between mesial temporal lobe structures and these structures may explain cognitive and psychiatric impairments often found in patients with MTLE",

Resting functional MRI scanning was performed on five left TLE patients who underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy resulting in seizure control and 10 healthy control subjects. Activation maps of functional signal peaks were calculated using a data-driven analysis, 2dTCA, across the group of patients. In addition to the expected region of activation in the left anterior hippocampus, the results of the 2dTCA analysis revealed activity in the bilateral insular cortex and default-mode network which are not commonly reported using fMRI, but are supported by other electrical and functional changes. The region of activation corresponding to the anterior hippocampal region of resection (presumably the epileptogenic region) was used as a seed region for fMRI functional connectivity analysis. This revealed increased negative connectivity in the patients as compared to controls across a network including thalamic, brainstem, frontal and parietal regions consistent with theories of inhibited function in subcortical and cortical structures during ictal propagation",

    abstract = "Recent studies on spontaneous fluctuations in the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in awake healthy subjects showed the presence of coherent fluctuations among functionally defined neuroanatomical networks. However, the functional significance of these spontaneous BOLD fluctuations remains poorly understood. By means of 3 T functional MRI, we demonstrate absent cortico-thalamic BOLD functional connectivity (i.e. between posterior cingulate/precuneal cortex and medial thalamus), but preserved cortico-cortical connectivity within the default network in a case of vegetative state (VS) studied 2.5 years following cardio-respiratory arrest, as documented by extensive behavioral and paraclinical assessments. In the VS patient, as in age-matched controls, anticorrelations could also be observed between posterior cingulate/precuneus and a previously identified task-positive cortical network. Both correlations and anticorrelations were significantly reduced in VS as compared to controls. A similar approach in a brain dead patient did not show any such long-distance functional connectivity. We conclude that some slow coherent BOLD fluctuations previously identified in healthy awake human brain can be found in alive but unaware patients, and are thus unlikely to be uniquely due to ongoing modifications of conscious thoughts. Future studies are needed to give a full characterization of default network connectivity in the VS patients population",

An unresolved question is whether functional connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI reflects anatomical connections. In this study, we used the well-characterized anatomy of cerebrocerebellar circuits to directly test whether intrinsic functional connectivity is associated with an anatomic pathway. Eleven first-episode stroke patients were scanned five times during a period of 6 months, and 11 healthy control subjects were scanned three times within 1 month. In patients with right pontine strokes, the functional connectivity between the right motor cortex and the left cerebellum was selectively reduced. This connectivity pattern was reversed in patients with left pontine strokes. Although factors beyond anatomical connectivity contribute to fMRI measures of functional correlation, these results provide direct evidence that functional connectivity depends on intact connections within a specific polysynaptic pathway.",

    abstract = "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with abnormal hypersynchronicity in basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. The clinical effectiveness of subthalamic nucleus (STN) high frequency stimulation indicates a crucial role of this nucleus within the affected motor networks in PD. Here we investigate alterations in the functional connectivity (FC) profile of the STN using resting state BOLD correlations on a voxel-by-voxel basis in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared early stage PD patients (n=31) during the medication-off state with healthy controls (n=44). The analysis revealed increased FC between the STN and cortical motor areas (BA 4 and 6) in PD patients in accordance with electrophysiological studies. Moreover, FC analysis of the primary motor cortex (M1) hand area revealed that the FC increase was primarily found in the STN area within the basal ganglia. These findings are in good agreement with recent experimental data, suggesting that an increased STN-motor cortex synchronicity mediated via the so called hyperdirect motor cortex-subthalamic pathway might play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of PD. An additional subgroup analysis was performed according to the presence (n=16) or absence (n=15) of tremor in patients. Compared to healthy controls tremor patients showed increased STN FC specifically in the hand area of M1 and the primary sensory cortex. In non-tremor patients, increased FC values were also found between the STN and midline cortical motor areas including the SMA. Taken together our results underline the importance of the STN as a key node for the modulation of BG-cortical motor network activity in PD patients.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Resting-state fMRI is a novel approach to measure spontaneous brain activity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Although most resting-state fMRI studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlations between low-frequency oscillations (LFOs), few studies have explored the amplitude of these LFOs in MDD. In this study, we applied the approaches of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF to examine the amplitude of LFOs in MDD.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 36 subjects, 18 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with MDD matched with 18 healthy controls (HCs) completed the fMRI scans. Compared with HCs, MDD patients showed increased ALFF in the right fusiform gyrus and the right anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but decreased ALFF in the left inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, and right lingual gyrus. The fALFF in patients was significantly increased in the right precentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, and bilateral anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum but was decreased in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left inferior temporal gyrus, and right inferior parietal lobule. After taking gray matter (GM) volume as a covariate, the results still remained.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings indicate that MDD patients have altered LFO amplitude in a number of regions distributed over the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices and the cerebellum. These aberrant regions may be related to the disturbances of multiple emotion- and cognition-related networks observed in MDD and the apparent heterogeneity in depressive symptom domains. Such brain functional alteration of MDD may contribute to further understanding of MDD-related network imbalances demonstrated in previous fMRI studies",

    abstract = "We examined the status of the neural network mediating the default mode of brain function, which typically exhibits greater activation during rest than during task, in patients in the early phase of schizophrenia and in young first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia. During functional MRI, patients, relatives, and controls alternated between rest and performance of working memory (WM) tasks. As expected, controls exhibited task-related suppression of activation in the default network, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. Patients and relatives exhibited significantly reduced task-related suppression in MPFC, and these reductions remained after controlling for performance. Increased task-related MPFC suppression correlated with better WM performance in patients and relatives and with less psychopathology in all 3 groups. For WM task performance, patients and relatives had greater activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than controls. During rest and task, patients and relatives exhibited abnormally high functional connectivity within the default network. The magnitudes of default network connectivity during rest and task correlated with psychopathology in the patients. Further, during both rest and task, patients exhibited reduced anticorrelations between MPFC and DLPFC, a region that was hyperactivated by patients and relatives during WM performance. Among patients, the magnitude of MPFC task suppression negatively correlated with default connectivity, suggesting an association between the hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity in schizophrenia. Hyperactivation (reduced task-related suppression) of default regions and hyperconnectivity of the default network may contribute to disturbances of thought in schizophrenia and risk for the illness",

Altered DMN and task-positive network activity has been observed in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects. However, no study has directly linked the patterns of between-state differences in the same aMCI cohort regarding these two types of functional networks. The spatial and temporal characteristics of intrinsic, low frequency BOLD signal fluctuations both during resting state and episodic memory fMRI task were assessed in 28 aMCI subjects and 23 matched healthy controls, using a posterior cingulate cortex-based temporal correlation analysis. aMCI subjects showed impaired attenuation in the DMN between rest and task state, and greater cognitive impairment was associated with decreased ability to attenuate DMN during task engagement. Moreover, more redistributed resource from DMN appeared to be required in aMCI to maintain the similar task performance possibly to offset their inability to engage task-positive networks. In order to complete a given task, mobilized and redistributed resources of DMN appeared to replace task-positive network function to some degrees in aMCI subjects. This may represent an inability to control the switching of functional modes between these types of network.",

    title = "{Toward discovery science of human brain function.}",
    abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain.

The high level of noise in fMRI leads to errors in functional connectivity detection algorithms. A common approach to mitigate the effects of noise is to apply spatial Gaussian smoothing, which can lead to blurring of regions beyond their actual boundaries and the loss of small connectivity regions. Recent work has suggested MRFs as an alternative spatial regularization in detection of fMRI activation in task-based paradigms. We propose to apply MRF priors to the computation of functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI. Our Markov priors are in the space of pairwise voxel connections, rather than in the original image space, resulting in a MRF whose dimension is twice that of the original image. The high dimensionality of the MRF estimation problem leads to computational challenges. We present an efficient, highly parallelized algorithm on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We validate our approach on a synthetically generated example as well as real data from a resting state fMRI study.",

We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in PD without comorbidity in three networks that have been linked to PD before. This could provide new insights in how functional integration of brain regions involved in fear and panic might relate to the symptomatology of PD. METHODS: Eleven PD patients without comorbidity and eleven pair-wise matched healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI. We used seed regions-of-interest in the bilateral amygdala (limbic network), the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (salience network), and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (default mode network). RSFC of these areas was assessed using seed-based correlations. All results were cluster corrected for multiple comparisons (Z>2.3, p<.05). RESULTS: Abnormalities were identified in the limbic network with increased RSFC between the right amygdala and the bilateral precuneus in PD patients. In the salience network the dACC demonstrated altered connectivity with frontal, parietal and occipital areas. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size and hypothesis-driven approach could restrict finding additional group differences that may exist. Other caveats are reflected in the use of medication by two participants and the acquisition of the resting-state scan at the end of a fixed imaging protocol. CONCLUSION: We found altered RSFC in PD between areas involved in emotion regulation and emotional and somatosensory stimulus processing, as well as an area engaged in self-referential processing, not implicated in models for PD before. These findings extend existing functional neuroanatomical models of PD, as the altered RSFC may underlie increased sensitivity for bodily symptoms",

    abstract = {FMRI has revealed the presence of correlated low-frequency cerebro-vascular oscillations within functional brain systems, which are thought to reflect an intrinsic feature of large-scale neural activity. The spatial correlations shown by these fluctuations has been their identifying feature, distinguishing them from fluctuations associated with other processes. Major analysis methods characterize these correlations, identifying networks and their interactions with various factors. However, other analysis approaches are required to fully characterize the regional signal dynamics contributing to these correlations between regions. In this study we show that analysis of the power spectral density (PSD) of regional signals can identify changes in oscillatory dynamics across conditions, and is able to characterize the nature and spatial extent of signal changes underlying changes in measures of connectivity. We analyzed spectral density changes in sessions consisting of both resting-state scans and scans recording 2 min blocks of continuous unilateral finger tapping and rest. We assessed the relationship of PSD and connectivity measures by additionally tracking correlations between selected motor regions. Spectral density gradually increased in gray and white matter during the experiment. Finger tapping produced widespread decreases in low-frequency spectral density. This change was symmetric across the cortex, and extended beyond both the lateralized task-related signal increases, and the established "resting-state" motor network. Correlations between motor regions also reduced with task performance. In conclusion, analysis of PSD is a sensitive method for detecting and characterizing BOLD signal oscillations that can enhance the analysis of network connectivity},

    abstract = "The present study aimed to investigate changes in structural gray matter (GM) volume and functional amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (LFO) and functional connectivity density in patients with subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI). Structural MRI and resting-sate functional MRI data were collected from 26 svMCI patients and 28 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Structurally, widespread GM atrophy was found in the svMCI patients that resided primarily in frontal (e.g., the superior and middle frontal gyri and medial prefrontal cortex) and temporal (the superior and inferior temporal gyri) brain regions as well as several subcortical brain sites (e.g., the thalamus and the caudate). Functionally, svMCI-related changes were predominantly found in the default mode network (DMN). Compared with the healthy controls, the svMCI patients exhibited decreased LFO amplitudes in the anterior part of the DMN (e.g., the medial prefrontal cortex), whereas increased LFO amplitudes in the posterior part of the DMN (e.g., the posterior cingulate/precuneus). As for functional connectivity density, the DMN regions (e.g., the posterior cingulate/precuneus, the medial prefrontal cortex and the middle temporal gyrus) consistently exhibited decreased functional connectivity. Finally, the overall patterns of functional alterations in LFO amplitudes and functional connectivity density remained little changed after controlling for structural GM volume losses, which suggests that functional abnormalities can be only partly explained by morphological GM volume changes. Together, our results indicate that svMCI patients exhibit widespread abnormalities in both structural GM volume and functional intrinsic brain activity, which have important implications in understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of svMCI",

    abstract = "Objectives: Neuroimaging studies have consistently implicated alterations of the basal ganglia and orbitofrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of OCD, however, recent work also emphasizes more diffuse patterns of brain alteration as occurring in this disorder. The goal of this study was to extend such observations by investigating large-scale brain functional network correlates of cognitive-control performance in OCD patients. Experimental design: We combined fMRI with a validated task of cognitive control and a multivariate statistical method to assess multiple functional networks encompassing broad task-relevant cortical regions in OCD patients and matched controls. Functional networks of interest were targeted a priori and the groups were compared in terms of the spatiotemporal profile of network responses (functional connectivity) during the task performance in a data-driven manner. Principal observations: Task performance was equivalent in both groups and each distinct network demonstrated strong overlap in its general response during task. However, significant differences in functional connectivity were also observed between groups that appeared driven by specific phases of task performance. Such differences were most pronounced during rest-task transitions and mainly involved dorsal anterior cingulate and insular cortices within the paralimbic network. Relative heightened functional connectivity of insula in patients during task correlated with a measure of patients' state anxiety. Conclusions: Our findings provide a novel functional imaging characterization of brain network alterations associated with cognitive-control in OCD. Additionally, these findings raise questions about the role of patients' arousal states on the performance of cognitive imaging tasks that are otherwise assumed to be emotionally neutral.

    abstract = "Shifts of attention to unattended stimuli (stimulus-driven reorienting) are often studied by measuring responses to unexpected stimuli, confounding reorienting and expectation. We separately measured the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal for both factors by manipulating the probability of salient visual cues that either shifted attention away from or maintained attention on a stream of visual stimuli. The results distinguished three networks recruited by reorienting. Right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior core of a ventral frontoparietal network, was activated more by cues for shifting than maintaining attention independently of cue location and probability, acting as a switch. TPJ was separately modulated by low probability cues, which signaled a breach of spatial expectation, independently of whether they shifted attention. Under resting conditions, TPJ activity was correlated [resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, (rs-fcMRI)] with right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an anterior component of the ventral network. Nevertheless, IFG was activated only by unexpected shifts of attention, dissociating its function from TPJ. Basal ganglia and frontal/insula regions also were activated only when reorienting was unexpected but showed strong rs-fcMRI among themselves, not with TPJ/IFG, defining a distinct network that may retrieve/activate commands for shifting attention. Within dorsal frontoparietal regions, shifting attention produced sustained spatially selective modulations in intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal-eye field (FEF), and transient less selective modulations in precuneus and FEF. Modulations were observed even when reorienting was likely, but increased when reorienting was unexpected. The latter result may partly reflect interactions with lateral prefrontal components of the basal-ganglia/frontal/insula network that showed significant rs-fcMRI with the dorsal network.",

However, the route to adult patterns of resting-state activity through neuronal development in the human brain is currently unknown. Therefore, we used functional MRI to map patterns of resting-state activity in infants during sleep. We found five unique resting-states networks in the infant brain that encompassed the primary visual cortex, bilateral sensorimotor areas, bilateral auditory cortex, a network including the precuneus area, lateral parietal cortex, and the cerebellum as well as an anterior network that incorporated the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that resting-state networks driven by spontaneous signal fluctuations are present already in the infant brain. The potential link between the emergence of behavior and patterns of resting-state activity in the infant brain is discussed.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported the left and right motor cortex to form a single resting-state network, without examining the specific organization of the functional connections between subregions of the primary motor network. The primary motor cortex has a somatotopic organization, clearly separating regions that control our feet from regions that control our fingers and other body parts. In this study, 3 T resting-state fMRI time-series of 46 healthy subjects were acquired; and for all subregions along the precentral gyrus, the location of the maximum level of functional connectivity within the contralateral primary motor cortex was computed, together with whole brain functional connectivity maps, to examine a possible somatotopic organization of the functional connections of the motor network. Subregions of the primary motor cortex were found to be most strongly functionally linked to regions in the contralateral hemisphere with a similar spatial location along the contralateral primary motor cortex as the selected seed regions. On the basis of the knowledge of a somatopic organization of the primary motor network, these findings suggest that functional subregions of the motor network are one-on-one linked to their functional homolog in the contralateral hemisphere and organized in a somatotopic fashion. Examining the specific organization of the functional connections within the primary motor network could enhance our overall understanding of the organization of resting-state functional communication within the brain.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: The human brain is a highly complex system that can be represented as a structurally interconnected and functionally synchronized network, which assures both the segregation and integration of information processing. Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography can be employed to explore the topological organization of human brain networks. However, little is known about whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new optical imaging technology, can be used to map functional connectome of the human brain and reveal meaningful and reproducible topological characteristics.RESULTS: We utilized resting-state fNIRS (R-fNIRS) to investigate the topological organization of human brain functional networks in 15 healthy adults. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding the temporal correlation matrices of 46 channels and analyzed using graph-theory approaches. We found that the functional brain network derived from R-fNIRS data had efficient small-world properties, significant hierarchical modular structure and highly connected hubs. These results were highly reproducible both across participants and over time and were consistent with previous findings based on other functional imaging techniques.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the feasibility and validity of using graph-theory approaches in conjunction with optical imaging techniques to explore the topological organization of human brain networks. These results may expand a methodological framework for utilizing fNIRS to study functional network changes that occur in association with development, aging and neurological and psychiatric disorders",

    abstract = "In humans, theta band (5-7 Hz) power typically increases when performing cognitively demanding working memory (WM) tasks, and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings have revealed an inverse relationship between theta power and the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal in the default mode network during WM. However, synchronization also plays a fundamental role in cognitive processing, and the level of theta and higher frequency band synchronization is modulated during WM. Yet, little is known about the link between BOLD, EEG power, and EEG synchronization during WM, and how these measures develop with human brain maturation or relate to behavioral changes. We examined EEG-BOLD signal correlations from 18 young adults and 15 school-aged children for age-dependent effects during a load-modulated Sternberg WM task. Frontal load (in-)dependent EEG theta power was significantly enhanced in children compared to adults, while adults showed stronger fMRI load effects. Children demonstrated a stronger negative correlation between global theta power and the BOLD signal in the default mode network relative to adults. Therefore, we conclude that theta power mediates the suppression of a task-irrelevant network. We further conclude that children suppress this network even more than adults, probably from an increased level of task-preparedness to compensate for not fully mature cognitive functions, reflected in lower response accuracy and increased reaction time. In contrast to power, correlations between instantaneous theta global field synchronization and the BOLD signal were exclusively positive in both age groups but only significant in adults in the frontal-parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. Furthermore, theta synchronization was weaker in children and was -in contrast to EEG power- positively correlated with response accuracy in both age groups. In summary we conclude that theta EEG-BOLD signal correlations differ between spectral power and synchronization and that these opposite correlations with different distributions undergo similar and significant neuronal developments with brain maturation",

It has been hypothesized that aberrant cortical connectivity is implicated in the disease (Friston, 1998), yet previous studies of functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia have shown mixed results (Garrity et al., 2007; Jafri et al., 2008; Lynall et al., 2010). We measured FC using fMRI in human schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during two different tasks and a rest condition, and constructed a voxel-based global FC index. We found a striking FC decrease in patients compared with controls. In the task conditions, relatively weaker FC was specific to regions of cortex not active during the task. In the rest condition, the FC difference between patients and controls was larger and allowed a case-by-case separation between individuals of the two groups. The results suggest that the relative reduction of FC in schizophrenia is dependent on the state of cortical activity, with voxels not activated by the task showing higher levels of FC deficiency. This novel finding may shed light on previous reports of FC in schizophrenia. Whether this neural characteristic is related to the development of the disorder remains to be established.",

This resting state questionnaire (ReSQ) consists of 62 items organized by five main types of mental activity: visual mental imagery (IMAG); inner language (LANG), split into two subtypes, inner speech (SPEE) and auditory mental imagery (AUDI); somatosensory awareness (SOMA); inner musical experience (MUSI); and mental manipulation of numbers (NUMB). For IMAG and LANG, additional questions estimated association of such activities with ongoing learning, retrospective memories, or prospective thoughts. Using a 0-100\% scale, the participant quantitatively rated the proportion of time spent in each mental activity during the resting state fMRI acquisition. A total of 180 healthy volunteers completed the ReSQ immediately after being scanned with fMRI while at rest. Of these, 66\% exhibited dominance of a type of mental activity at rest (IMAG: 35\%; LANG: 17\%; SOMA: 7\%; MUSI: 6\%; NUMB: 1\%). A majority of participants reported either retrospective memories (82\%) or prospective thoughts (78\%), with 58\% of participants reporting both in at least one type of mental activity. Thoughts related to ongoing learning were low (37\% of participants). The present results are consistent with those of previous studies investigating inner experience in a natural environment. In conclusion, we provide a robust and easy-to-implement tool for the exploration of mental activities during rest of healthy participants undergoing fMRI. This tool relies on normative data acquired from a 180-participant sample balanced for sex and handedness.",

    abstract = {Graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional connectivity MRI data (ie. diffusion tractography or cortical volume correlation and resting-state or task-related (effective) fMRI, respectively) has provided new measures of human brain organization in vivo. The most striking discovery is that the whole-brain network exhibits "small-world" properties shared with many other complex systems (social, technological, information, biological). This topology allows a high efficiency at different spatial and temporal scale with a very low wiring and energy cost. Its modular organization also allows for a high level of adaptation. In addition, degree distribution of brain networks demonstrates highly connected hubs that are crucial for the whole-network functioning. Many of these hubs have been identified in regions previously defined as belonging to the default-mode network (potentially explaining the high basal metabolism of this network) and the attentional networks. This could explain the crucial role of these hub regions in physiology (task-related fMRI data) as well as in pathophysiology. Indeed, such topological definition provides a reliable framework for predicting behavioral consequences of focal or multifocal lesions such as stroke, tumors or multiple sclerosis. It also brings new insights into a better understanding of pathophysiology of many neurological or psychiatric diseases affecting specific local or global brain networks such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Graph theoretical analysis of connectivity MRI data provides an outstanding framework to merge anatomical and functional data in order to better understand brain pathologies.},

Little is known about the organization of the insula when involved in active tasks. We explored this issue using a novel meta-analytic clustering approach. We queried the BrainMap database asking for papers involving normal subjects that recorded activations in the insular cortex, retrieving 1305 papers, involving 22,872 subjects and a total of 2957 foci. Data were analyzed with several different methodologies, some of which expressly designed for this work. We used meta-analytic connectivity modeling and meta-analytic clustering of data obtained from the BrainMap database. We performed cluster analysis to subdivide the insula in areas with homogeneous connectivity, and density analysis of the activated foci using Voronoi tessellation. Our results confirm and extend previous findings obtained investigating the resting state connectivity of the anterior-posterior and left-right insulae. They indicate, for the first time, that some blocks of the anterior insula play the role of hubs between the anterior and the posterior insulae, as confirmed by their activation in several different paradigms. This finding supports the view that the network to which the anterior insula belongs is related to saliency detection. The insulae of both sides can be parcellated in two clusters, the anterior and the posterior: the anterior is characterized by an attentional pattern of connectivity with frontal, cingulate, parietal, cerebellar and anterior insular highly connected areas, whereas the posterior is characterized by a more local connectivity pattern with connections to sensorimotor, temporal and posterior cingulate areas. This antero-posterior subdivision, better characterized on the right side, results sharper with the connectivity based clusterization than with the behavioral based clusterization. The circuits belonging to the anterior insula are very homogeneous and their blocks in multidimensional scaling of MACM-based profiles are in central position, whereas those belonging to the posterior insula, especially on the left, are located at the periphery and sparse, thus suggesting that the posterior circuits bear a more heterogeneous connectivity. The anterior cluster is mostly activated by cognition, whereas the posterior is mostly activated by interoception, perception and emotion",

Risk aversion was measured using a series of standard questions in which participants were asked to choose between a certain monetary payment (\$15) versus a gamble in which they could gain more than \$15 or gain nothing, with potential gains varied across questions. Participants determined to be "high" (n=27) and "low" (n=27) in risk aversion were grouped accordingly. Using a spherical seed region of interest in the anterior cingulate cortex, voxel-wise functional connectivity network similarities were observed in bilateral frontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, insula, basal ganglia, temporal, parietal, and thalamic regions. Differences in functional connectivity were observed such that those low in risk aversion had greater connectivity to clusters in the superior, middle, and medial frontal regions, as well as cerebellar, parietal, occipital, and inferior temporal regions. Those high in risk aversion had greater connectivity to clusters in the inferior and orbital frontal, parahippocampal, and insula regions, as well as thalamic, parietal, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and middle temporal regions.

Most studies to date have focused on resting data, while the study of functional connectivity during task and the differences between task and rest are of great interest as well. In this work, we examine the graph-theoretical properties of the connectivity maps constructed using spatial components derived from independent component analysis (ICA) for healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia during an auditory oddball task (AOD) and at extended rest. We estimate functional connectivity using the higher-order statistical dependence, i.e., mutual information among the ICA spatial components, instead of the typically used temporal correlation. We also define three novel topological metrics based on the modules of brain networks obtained using a clustering approach. Our experimental results show that although the schizophrenia patients preserve the small-world property, they present a significantly lower small-worldness during both AOD task and rest when compared to the healthy controls, indicating a consistent tendency towards a more random organization of brain networks. In addition, the task-induced modulations to topological measures of several components involving motor, cerebellum and parietal regions are altered in patients relative to controls, providing further evidence for the aberrant connectivity in schizophrenia",

In the current study, we hypothesize that the strength of DMN-connectivity contributes to distinct introspective psychological processes in every-day social life such as the intuitive understanding of other people through inner representation of their affective states -e. g. his or her pain. 19 healthy individuals underwent functional MRI scanning, which consisted of a resting-state-scan followed by the presentation of visual stimuli depicting human limbs in painful and non-painful situations. After scanning, participants were asked to evaluate the stimuli in terms of pain intensity perceived from the first person perspective. Independent component analysis (ICA) demonstrated that higher integration of the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (BA 32) into the anterior default mode network (aDMN) was associated with higher post-scan pain ratings. Furthermore, the exposition to the "Pain"-pictures led to relative increases of aDMN-activity compared to "No Pain"-stimuli which were also correlated with the subjective pain intensity. The behaviorally predictive functional architecture during a task-free period supports the notion that the DMN serves as a "memory of the future" [Ingvar DH (1985) Hum Neurobiol 4:127-136] in terms of a neuronal cache, storing "a priori scripts," which are recalled to deal efficiently with upcoming environmental events. In addition, our results suggest that an individual predisposition to identify oneself with another's pain influences the automatic response of the DMN during the observation of painful situations.},

    abstract = "Dissociative amnesia is a condition usually characterized by severely impaired retrograde memory functioning in the absence of structural brain damage. Recent case studies nevertheless found functional brain changes in patients suffering from autobiographical-episodic memory loss in the cause of dissociative amnesia. Functional changes were demonstrated in both resting state and memory retrieval conditions. In addition, some but not all cases also showed other neuropsychological impairments beyond retrograde memory deficits. However, there is no group study available that examined potential functional brain abnormalities and accompanying neuropsychological deteriorations in larger samples of patients with dissociative retrograde amnesia. We report functional imaging and neuropsychological data acquired in 14 patients with dissociative amnesia following stressful or traumatic events. All patients suffered from autobiographical memory loss. In addition, approximately half of the patients had deficits in anterograde memory and executive functioning. Accompanying functional brain changes were measured by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Regional glucose utilization of the patients was compared with that of 19 healthy subjects, matched for age and gender. We found significantly decreased glucose utilization in the right inferolateral prefrontal cortex in the patients. Hypometabolism in this brain region, known to be involved in retrieval of autobiographical memories and self-referential processing, may be a functional brain correlate of dissociative amnesia.",

Changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging activation patterns in such conditions can be ambiguous as they might either reflect some aspect of the primary pathophysiological mechanism or, alternatively, may be the result of adaptive actions during task execution. To circumvent this problem, we examined WC patients during rest, i.e., without a task, using independent component analysis (ICA) applied to the blood oxygen level-dependent time series.METHODS: Functionally connected brain networks during rest were defined by ICA to assess differences between WC patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 16). Analysis was carried out using FMRIB's Software Library.RESULTS: Two functional networks showed between-group differences, the sensorimotor network and the default-mode network. In WC patients, the connectivity was reduced in the left postcentral area and increased in basal ganglia in contrast to healthy controls. These changes were not reversed after treatment with botulinum toxin.CONCLUSIONS: In line with other studies, the results show a dysfunction in cortico-subcortical circuits in WC involving somatosensory cortex, areas interfacing the sensory and motor systems, and putamen contralateral to symptomatic hand",

    abstract = "Functional connectivity among brain regions has been investigated via an analysis of correlations between regional signal fluctuations recorded in magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in a steady state. In comparison with studies of functional connectivity that utilize task manipulations, the analysis of correlations in steady state data is less susceptible to confounds arising when functionally unrelated brain regions respond in similar ways to changes in task. A new approach to identifying interregional correlations in steady state data makes use of two independent data sets. Regions of interest (ROIs) are defined and hypotheses regarding their connectivity are generated in one data set. The connectivity hypotheses are then evaluated in the remaining (independent) data set by analyzing low frequency temporal correlations between regions. The roles of the two data sets are then reversed and the process repeated, perhaps multiple times. This method was illustrated by application to the language system. The existence of a functional connection between Broca's area and Wernicke's area was confirmed in healthy subjects at rest. An increase in this functional connection when the language system was actively engaged (when subjects were continuously listening to narrative text) was also confirmed. In a second iteration of analyses, a correlation between Broca's area and a region in left premotor cortex was found to be significant at rest and to increase during continuous listening. These findings suggest that the proposed methodology can reveal the presence and strength of functional connections in high-level cognitive systems.",

The magnetization transfer effect with TILT is well controlled by using concatenated radiofrequency pulses. However, use of TILT has been limited by several challenges, including slice profile errors, sensitivity to arterial transit time and intrinsic low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this work, we propose to address these challenges by making the original TILT method into a novel pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling approach, named pseudo-continuous transfer insensitive labeling technique (pTILT). pTILT improves perfusion acquisitions by (i) realizing pseudo-continuous tagging with nonadiabatic pulses, (ii) being sensitive to slow flows in addition to fast flows, and (iii) providing flexible labeling geometries. Perfusion maps during both resting state and functional tasks are successfully demonstrated in healthy volunteers with pTILT. A comparison with typical SNR values from other perfusion techniques shows that although pTILT provides less SNR than inversion-based pseudo-continuous ASL techniques, the modified sequence provides similar SNR to inversion-based PASL techniques",

    abstract = "A distributed network of brain regions is linked to drug-related cue responding. However, the relationships between smoking cue-induced phasic activity and possible underlying differences in brain structure, tonic neuronal activity and connectivity between these brain areas are as yet unclear. Twenty-two smokers and 22 controls viewed smoking-related and neutral pictures during a functional arterial spin labeling scanning session. T1, resting functional, and diffusion tensor imaging data were also collected. Six brain areas, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/cingulate cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), occipital cortex, and insula/operculum, showed significant smoking cue-elicited activity in smokers when compared with controls and were subjected to secondary analysis for resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), structural, and tonic neuronal activity. rsFC strength between rACC and dlPFC was positively correlated with the cue-elicited activity in dlPFC. Similarly, rsFC strength between dlPFC and dmPFC was positively correlated with the cue-elicited activity in dmPFC while rsFC strength between dmPFC and insula/operculum was negatively correlated with the cue-elicited activity in both dmPFC and insula/operculum, suggesting these brain circuits may facilitate the response to the salient smoking cues. Further, the gray matter density in dlPFC was decreased in smokers and correlated with cue-elicited activity in the same brain area, suggesting a neurobiological mechanism for the impaired cognitive control associated with drug use. Taken together, these results begin to address the underlying neurobiology of smoking cue salience, and may speak to novel treatment strategies and targets for therapeutic interventions.",

The primary objective of ADNI was and continues to be improving methods for clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach to the present ("ADNI-GO") and future ("ADNI-2," if funded) MRI protocol will be to maintain MRI methodological consistency in the previously enrolled "ADNI-1" subjects who are followed up longitudinally in ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. We will modernize and expand the MRI protocol for all newly enrolled ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 subjects. All newly enrolled subjects will be scanned at 3T with a core set of three sequence types: 3D T1-weighted volume, FLAIR, and a long TE gradient echo volumetric acquisition for micro hemorrhage detection. In addition to this core ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 protocol, we will perform vendor-specific pilot sub-studies of arterial spin-labeling perfusion, resting state functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging. One of these sequences will be added to the core protocol on systems from each MRI vendor. These experimental sub-studies are designed to demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring useful data in a multicenter (but single vendor) setting for these three emerging MRI applications.},

Parallel computing was used to quantify short- and long-range functional connectivity densities in 913 healthy subjects. Short-range connectivity was rightward lateralized and most asymmetrical in areas around the lateral sulcus, whereas long-range connectivity was rightward lateralized in lateral sulcus and leftward lateralizated in inferior prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus. The posterior inferior occipital cortex was leftward lateralized (short- and long-range connectivity). Males had greater rightward lateralization of brain connectivity in superior temporal (short- and long-range), inferior frontal, and inferior occipital cortices (short-range), whereas females had greater leftward lateralization of long-range connectivity in the inferior frontal cortex. The greater lateralization of the male's brain (rightward and predominantly short-range) may underlie their greater vulnerability to disorders with disrupted brain asymmetries (schizophrenia, autism)",

    abstract = "From toddler to late teenager, the macroscopic pattern of axonal projections in the human brain remains largely unchanged while undergoing dramatic functional modifications that lead to network refinement. These functional modifications are mediated by increasing myelination and changes in axonal diameter and synaptic density, as well as changes in neurochemical mediators. Here we explore the contribution of white matter maturation to the development of connectivity between ages 2 and 18 y using high b-value diffusion MRI tractography and connectivity analysis. We measured changes in connection efficacy as the inverse of the average diffusivity along a fiber tract. We observed significant refinement in specific metrics of network topology, including a significant increase in node strength and efficiency along with a decrease in clustering. Major structural modules and hubs were in place by 2 y of age, and they continued to strengthen their profile during subsequent development. Recording resting-state functional MRI from a subset of subjects, we confirmed a positive correlation between structural and functional connectivity, and in addition observed that this relationship strengthened with age. Continuously increasing integration and decreasing segregation of structural connectivity with age suggests that network refinement mediated by white matter maturation promotes increased global efficiency. In addition, the strengthening of the correlation between structural and functional connectivity with age suggests that white matter connectivity in combination with other factors, such as differential modulation of axonal diameter and myelin thickness, that are partially captured by inverse average diffusivity, play an increasingly important role in creating brain-wide coherence and synchrony.",

While these circuits have been studied extensively in animals, human neuroimaging investigations of amygdala-based networks have typically considered the amygdala as a single structure, which likely masks contributions of individual amygdala subdivisions. The present study uses resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether distinct functional connectivity patterns, like those observed in animal studies, can be detected across three amygdala subdivisions: laterobasal, centromedial, and superficial. In a sample of 65 healthy adults, voxelwise regression analyses demonstrated positively-predicted ventral and negatively-predicted dorsal networks associated with the total amygdala, consistent with previous animal and human studies. Investigation of individual amygdala subdivisions revealed distinct differences in connectivity patterns within the amygdala and throughout the brain. Spontaneous activity in the laterobasal subdivision predicted activity in temporal and frontal regions, while activity in the centromedial nuclei predicted activity primarily in striatum. Activity in the superficial subdivision positively predicted activity throughout the limbic lobe. These findings suggest that resting state fMRI can be used to investigate human amygdala networks at a greater level of detail than previously appreciated, allowing for the further advancement of translational models",

While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral tasks by name (e.g., the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. Drawing from the taxonomy developed and used by the BrainMap project ( www.brainmap.org ) for almost two decades to describe key components of published functional imaging results, we have developed an ontology capable of representing certain characteristics of the cognitive paradigms used in the fMRI and PET literature. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology is being developed to be compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and to harmonize where possible with larger ontologies such as RadLex, NeuroLex, or the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The key components of CogPO include the representation of experimental conditions focused on the stimuli presented, the instructions given, and the responses requested. The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. Categorization of paradigms according to stimulus, response, and instruction has been shown to allow advanced data retrieval techniques by searching for similarities and contrasts across multiple paradigm levels. The goal of CogPO is to develop, evaluate, and distribute a domain ontology of cognitive paradigms for application and use in the functional neuroimaging community",

RECENT FINDINGS:Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a relatively novel technique that has several potential advantages over task-activation functional magnetic resonance imaging in terms of its clinical applicability. A number of research groups have begun to investigate the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease, depression, and schizophrenia. Although preliminary results have been fairly consistent in some disorders (for example, Alzheimer's disease) they have been less reproducible in others (schizophrenia). Resting-state connectivity has been shown to correlate with behavioral performance and emotional measures. It's potential as a biomarker of disease and an early objective marker of treatment response is genuine but still to be realized. SUMMARY:Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has made some strides in the clinical realm but significant advances are required before it can be used in a meaningful way at the single-patient level.",

    abstract = "Heart rate fluctuations occur in the low-frequency range (<0.1 Hz) probed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of resting-state functional connectivity and most fMRI block paradigms and may be related to low-frequency blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. To investigate this hypothesis, temporal correlations between cardiac rate and resting-state fMRI signal timecourses were assessed at 3 T. Resting-state BOLD fMRI and accompanying physiological data were acquired and analyzed using cross-correlation and regression. Time-shifted cardiac rate timecourses were included as regressors in addition to established physiological regressors (RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn Reson Med 44, 162-167) and respiration volume per unit time (Birn, R.M., Diamond, J.B., Smith, M.A., Bandettini, P.A., 2006b. Separating respiratory-variation-related fluctuations from neuronal-activity-related fluctuations in fMRI. NeuroImage 31, 1536-1548). Significant correlations between the cardiac rate and BOLD signal timecourses were revealed, particularly negative correlations in gray matter at time shifts of 6-12 s and positive correlations at time shifts of 30-42 s (TR=6 s). Regressors consisting of cardiac rate timecourses shifted by delays of between 0 and 24 s explained an additional 1\% of the BOLD signal variance on average over the whole brain across 9 subjects, a similar additional variance to that explained by respiration volume per unit time and RETROICOR regressors, even when used in combination with these other physiological regressors. This suggests that including such time-shifted cardiac rate regressors will be beneficial for explaining physiological noise variance and will thereby improve the statistical power in future task-based and resting-state fMRI studies",

In this study, we investigated associations between resting-state networks and individual psychopathology in sixteen patients with paranoid schizophrenia and sixteen matched healthy control participants. We estimated whole-brain functional connectivity of multiple networks using a combination of spatial independent component analysis and multiple regression analysis. Five networks (default-mode, left and right fronto-parietal, left fronto-temporal and auditory networks) were selected for analysis based on their involvement in neuropsychological models of psychosis. Between-group comparisons and correlations to psychopathology ratings were performed on both spatial (connectivity distributions) and temporal features (power-spectral densities of temporal frequencies below 0.06 Hz). Schizophrenia patients showed aberrant functional connectivity in the default-mode network, which correlated with severity of hallucinations and delusions, and decreased hemispheric separation of fronto-parietal activity, which correlated with disorganization symptoms. Furthermore, the severity of positive symptoms correlated with functional connectivity of fronto-temporal and auditory networks. Finally, default-mode and auditory networks showed increased spectral power of low frequency oscillations, which correlated with positive symptom severity. These results are in line with findings from studies that investigated the neural correlates of positive symptoms and suggest that psychopathology is associated with aberrant intrinsic organization of functional brain networks in schizophrenia.",

We compared the differences in ReHo between the two groups within the DMN and investigated the relationships between sex, age, years of education, disease duration, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) total score, and ReHo in regions with significant group differences.RESULTS: Our results revealed that bipolar depressed patients had increased ReHo in the left medial frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobe compared to healthy controls. No correlations were found between regional ReHo values and sex, age, and clinical features within the BD group.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that abnormal brain activity is mainly distributed within prefrontal-limbic circuits, which are believed to be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bipolar depression",

    title = "{Iterative approach of dual regression with a sparse prior enhances the performance of independent component analysis for group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.}",
    abstract = {This study proposes an iterative dual-regression (DR) approach with sparse prior regularization to better estimate an individual's neuronal activation using the results of an independent component analysis (ICA) method applied to a temporally concatenated group of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (i.e., Tc-GICA method). An ordinary DR approach estimates the spatial patterns (SPs) of neuronal activation and corresponding time courses (TCs) specific to each individual's fMRI data with two steps involving least-squares (LS) solutions. Our proposed approach employs iterative LS solutions to refine both the individual SPs and TCs with an additional a priori assumption of sparseness in the SPs (i.e., minimally overlapping SPs) based on L(1)-norm minimization. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of this approach, semi-artificial fMRI data were created from resting-state fMRI data with the following considerations: (1) an artificially designed spatial layout of neuronal activation patterns with varying overlap sizes across subjects and (2) a BOLD time series (TS) with variable parameters such as onset time, duration, and maximum BOLD levels. To systematically control the spatial layout variability of neuronal activation patterns across the "subjects" (n=12), the degree of spatial overlap across all subjects was varied from a minimum of 1voxel (i.e., 0.5-voxel cubic radius) to a maximum of 81voxels (i.e., 2.5-voxel radius) across the task-related SPs with a size of 100voxels for both the block-based and event-related task paradigms. In addition, several levels of maximum percentage BOLD intensity (i.e., 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0\%) were used for each degree of spatial overlap size. From the results, the estimated individual SPs of neuronal activation obtained from the proposed iterative DR approach with a sparse prior showed an enhanced true positive rate and reduced false positive rate compared to the ordinary DR approach. The estimated TCs of the task-related SPs from our proposed approach showed greater temporal correlation coefficients with a reference hemodynamic response function than those of the ordinary DR approach. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed DR approach was also successfully demonstrated by the results of real fMRI data acquired from left-/right-hand clenching tasks in both block-based and event-related task paradigms},

However, current methods are prone to overestimate the dimensions, especially for concatenated group data sets. This work aims to develop improved dimension estimation methods for group fMRI data generated by data reduction and grouping procedure at multiple levels. We proposed a "noise-blurring" approach to suppress intragroup signal variations and to correct spectral alterations caused by the data reduction, which should be responsible for the group dimension overestimation. This technique was evaluated on both simulated group data sets and in vivo resting-state fMRI data sets acquired from 14 normal human subjects during five different scan sessions. Reduction and grouping procedures were repeated at three levels in either "scan-session-subject" or "scan-subject-session" order. Compared with traditional estimation methods, our approach exhibits a stronger immunity against intragroup signal variation, less sensitivity to group size and a better agreement on the dimensions at the third level between the two grouping orders.},

The ReHo was analyzed by the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data analysis toolbox). The ReHos of different time-points were compared by using paired t test function of REST.RESULTS: ReHo increased in right superior frontal cortex, right medial frontal cortex and decreased in right superior temporal cortex (uncorrected p<0.00005, cluster threshold>20, surface connected theory) after remission of symptoms in these FEMDDPD patients within 6 weeks (improvements of clinician rating and self rating scale scores; post-hoc corrected p<0.001). No significant changes of ReHo were observed in the controls within 6 weeks (uncorrected p<0.1, no cluster threshold setting, surface connected theory). The changes of ReHo value were mildly correlated with improvements of clinical rating scales with age, gender, depression and anxiety severity as covariates.CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that differential modulations inside the default mode network probably were associated with remission of FEMDDPD symptoms after duloxetine therapy},

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that may consist of multiple etiologies and disease processes. Auditory hallucinations (AH), which are common and often disabling, represent a narrower and more basic dimension of psychosis than schizophrenia. Previous studies suggest that abnormal primary auditory cortex activity is associated with AH pathogenesis. We thus investigated functional connectivity, using a seed in primary auditory cortex, in schizophrenia patients with and without AH and healthy controls, to examine neural circuit abnormalities associated more specifically with AH than the myriad other symptoms that comprise schizophrenia. METHODS: Using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), we investigated functional connectivity of the primary auditory cortex, located on Heschl's gyrus, in schizophrenia spectrum patients with AH. Participants were patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder with lifetime AH (n=27); patients with the same diagnoses but no lifetime AH (n=14); and healthy controls (n=28). RESULTS: Patients with AH vulnerability showed increased left Heschl's gyrus functional connectivity with left frontoparietal regions and decreased functional connectivity with right hippocampal formation and mediodorsal thalamus compared to patients without lifetime AH. Furthermore, among AH patients, left Heschl's gyrus functional connectivity covaried positively with AH severity in left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area), left lateral STG, right pre- and postcentral gyri, cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. There were no differences between patients with and without lifetime AH in right Heschl's gyrus seeded functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal interactions between left Heschl's gyrus and regions involved in speech/language, memory, and the monitoring of self-generated events may contribute to AH vulnerability",

Despite a recent expansion of studies investigating resting-state LF-BOLD correlations, their nature and function are poorly understood. A major constraint on LF-BOLD correlations appears to be stable properties of anatomic connectivity. There is also evidence that coupling can be modulated by recent or ongoing task performance, suggesting that certain components of correlated dynamics are malleable on short timescales. Here, we compared activity during extended periods of rest following performance of 2 distinct cognitive tasks using different categories of visual stimuli-faces and complex scenes. Prolonged exposure to these distinct categories of visual information caused frontal networks to couple differentially with posterior category-preferential visual regions during subsequent periods of rest. In addition, we report preliminary evidence suggesting that conditions exist in which the degree of modulation of LF-BOLD correlations predicts subsequent memory. The finding that resting-state LF-BOLD correlations are modulated by recent experience in functionally specific brain regions engaged during prior task performance clarifies their role as a dynamic phenomenon which may be involved in mnemonic processes.",

To find out whether such fluctuations would be altered by persistent pain, we asked 10 patients with unrelenting chronic pain of different etiologies and 10 sex- and age-matched control subjects to rest with eyes open during 3-T functional MRI. Independent component analysis was used to identify functionally coupled brain networks. Time courses of an independent component comprising the insular cortices of both hemispheres showed stronger spectral power at 0.12 to 0.25 Hz in patients than in control subjects, with the largest difference at 0.16 Hz. A similar but weaker effect was seen in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas activity of the precuneus and early visual cortex, used as a control site, did not differ between the groups. In the patient group, seed point-based correlation analysis revealed altered spatial connectivity between insulae and anterior cingulate cortex. The results imply both temporally and spatially aberrant activity of the affective pain-processing areas in patients suffering from chronic pain. The accentuated 0.12- to 0.25-Hz fluctuations in the patient group might be related to altered activity of the autonomic nervous system",

    abstract = "Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) holds promise as a clinical tool to characterize and monitor the phenotype of different neurological and psychiatric disorders. The most common analysis approach requires the definition of one or more regions-of-interest (ROIs). However this need for a priori ROI information makes rs-fMRI inadequate to survey functional connectivity differences associated with a range of neurological disorders where the ROI information may not be available. A second problem encountered in fMRI measures of connectivity is the need for an arbitrary correlation threshold to determine whether or not two areas are connected. This is problematic because in many cases the differences in tissue connectivity between disease groups and/or control subjects are threshold dependent. In this work we propose a novel voxel-based contrast mechanism for rs-fMRI, the Intrinsic Connectivity Distribution (ICD), that neither requires a priori information to define a ROI, nor an arbitrary threshold to define a connection. We show the sensitivity of previous methods to the choice of connection thresholds and evaluate ICD using a survey study comparing young adults born prematurely to healthy term control subjects. Functional connectivity differences were found in hypothesized language processing areas in the left temporal-parietal areas. In addition, significant clinically-relevant differences were found between preterm and term control subjects, highlighting the importance of whole brain surveys independent of a priori information",

In a paradigm requiring sustained vigilance for instance, we previously observed that higher prestimulus activity in a cingulo-insular-thalamic network facilitated subsequent perception. Here, we test our proposed interpretation that this network underpins maintenance of tonic alertness. We used simultaneous acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in the absence of any paradigm to test an ensuing hypothesis, namely that spontaneous fluctuations in this ICN's activity (as measured by fMRI) should show a positive correlation with the electrical signatures of tonic alertness (as recorded by concurrent EEG). We found in human subjects (19 male, 7 female) that activity in a network comprising dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, anterior prefrontal cortex and thalamus is positively correlated with global field power (GFP) of upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) oscillations, the most consistent electrical index of tonic alertness. Conversely, and in line with earlier findings, alpha band power was negatively correlated with activity in another ICN, the so-called dorsal attention network which is most prominently involved in selective spatial attention. We propose that the cingulo-insular-thalamic network serves maintaining tonic alertness through generalized expression of cortical alpha oscillations. Attention is mediated by activity in other systems, e.g., the dorsal attention network for space, selectively disrupts alertness-related suppression and hence manifests as local attenuation of alpha activity",

The aim of our study was to investigate the alterations in cortical thickness and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in PTSD patients resulting from motor vehicle accidents (MVCs), and to explore the association of cortical thickness and ALFF with the severity of PTSD symptoms. A total of 20 PTSD patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited and examined by high-resolution structural MRI combined with resting-state fMRI. The results showed significant decrease in cortical thickness in the left BA10, BA32 and BA45 and the right superior temporal gyrus in PTSD patients. The ALFF value in PTSD patients increased significantly in the left BA10 and BA32 and the right cerebellum. Linear regression revealed that decreased cortical thickness and increased ALFF in the BA10 were associated with the increased PTSD scores. These findings suggest that the structural integrity and resting-state function in the BA10 play an important role in the pathogenesis of PTSD",

    abstract = "Fiber clustering is a prerequisite step towards tract-based analysis of white mater integrity via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in various clinical neuroscience applications. Many methods reported in the literature used geometric or anatomic information for fiber clustering. This paper proposes a novel method that uses functional coherence as the criterion to guide the clustering of fibers derived from DTI tractography. Specifically, we represent the functional identity of a white matter fiber by two resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) time series extracted from the two gray matter voxels to which the fiber connects. Then, the functional coherence or similarity between two white matter fibers is defined as their rsfMRI time series' correlations, and the data-driven affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is used to cluster fibers into bundles. At current stage, we use the corpus callosum (CC) fibers that are the largest fiber bundle in the brain as an example. Experimental results show that the proposed fiber clustering method can achieve meaningful bundles that are reasonably consistent across different brains, and part of the clustered bundles was validated via the benchmark data provided by task-based fMRI data.",

Midline default network areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, are implicated in self-referential and social cognitive tasks. Thus, the neural substrates within the default mode network (DMN) have the potential to mediate self-referential and social cognitive information processing in UHR subjects. METHODS: This study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate resting-state DMN and task-related network (TRN) functional connectivity in 19 UHR subjects and 20 matched healthy controls. The bilateral posterior cingulate cortex was selected as a seed region, and the intrinsic organization for all subjects was reconstructed on the basis of fMRI time series correlation. RESULTS: Default mode areas included the posterior/anterior cingulate cortices, the medial prefrontal cortex, the lateral parietal cortex, and the inferior temporal region. Task-related network areas included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, the inferior parietal lobule, and middle temporal cortex. Compared to healthy controls, UHR subjects exhibit hyperconnectivity within the default network regions and reduced anti-correlations (or negative correlations nearer to zero) between the posterior cingulate cortex and task-related areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abnormal resting-state network activity may be related with the clinical features of UHR subjects. Neurodevelopmental and anatomical alterations of cortical midline structure might underlie altered intrinsic networks in UHR subjects.",

    abstract = "Confounding noise in BOLD fMRI data arises primarily from fluctuations in blood flow and oxygenation due to cardiac and respiratory effects, spontaneous low frequency oscillations (LFO) in arterial pressure, and non-task related neural activity. Cardiac noise is particularly problematic, as the low sampling frequency of BOLD fMRI ensures that these effects are aliased in recorded data. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the noise signal through measurement and transformation of the cardiac and respiratory waveforms (e.g. RETROICOR and respiration volume per time (RVT)) and model-free estimation of noise variance through examination of spatial and temporal patterns. We have previously demonstrated that by applying a voxel-specific time delay to concurrently acquired near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, we can generate regressors that reflect systemic blood flow and oxygenation fluctuations effects. Here, we apply this method to the task of removing physiological noise from BOLD data. We compare the efficacy of noise removal using various sets of noise regressors generated from NIRS data, and also compare the noise removal to RETROICOR+RVT. We compare the results of resting state analyses using the original and noise filtered data, and we evaluate the bias for the different noise filtration methods by computing null distributions from the resting data and comparing them with the expected theoretical distributions. Using the best set of processing choices, six NIRS-generated regressors with voxel-specific time delays explain a median of 10.5\% of the variance throughout the brain, with the highest reductions being seen in gray matter. By comparison, the nine RETROICOR+RVT regressors together explain a median of 6.8\% of the variance in the BOLD data. Detection of resting state networks was enhanced with NIRS denoising, and there were no appreciable differences in the bias of the different techniques. Physiological noise regressors generated using Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offer an effective method for efficiently removing hemodynamic noise from BOLD data",

We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to define subregions within the cerebellar cortex based on their functional connectivity with the cerebral cortex. We mapped resting-state functional connectivity voxel-wise across the cerebellar cortex, for cerebral-cortical masks covering prefrontal, motor, somatosensory, posterior parietal, visual, and auditory cortices. We found that the cerebellum can be divided into at least 2 zones: 1) a primary sensorimotor zone (Lobules V, VI, and VIII), which contains overlapping functional connectivity maps for domain-specific motor, somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices; and 2) a supramodal zone (Lobules VIIa, Crus I, and II), which contains overlapping functional connectivity maps for prefrontal and posterior-parietal cortex. The cortical connectivity of the supramodal zone was driven by regions of frontal and parietal cortex which are not directly involved in sensory or motor processing, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontal pole, and the inferior parietal lobule.",

    abstract = {Clinical diagnosis of disorders of consciousness (DOC) caused by brain injury poses great challenges since patients are often behaviorally unresponsive. A promising new approach towards objective DOC diagnosis may be offered by the analysis of ultra-slow (<0.1 Hz) spontaneous brain activity fluctuations measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the resting-state. Previous work has shown reduced functional connectivity within the "default network", a subset of regions known to be deactivated during engaging tasks, which correlated with the degree of consciousness impairment. However, it remains unclear whether the breakdown of connectivity is restricted to the "default network", and to what degree changes in functional connectivity can be observed at the single subject level. Here, we analyzed resting-state inter-hemispheric connectivity in three homotopic regions of interest, which could reliably be identified based on distinct anatomical landmarks, and were part of the "Extrinsic" (externally oriented, task positive) network (pre- and postcentral gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired for a group of 11 healthy subjects and 8 DOC patients. At the group level, our results indicate decreased inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in subjects with impaired awareness as compared to subjects with intact awareness. Individual connectivity scores significantly correlated with the degree of consciousness. Furthermore, a single-case statistic indicated a significant deviation from the healthy sample in 5/8 patients. Importantly, of the three patients whose connectivity indices were comparable to the healthy sample, one was diagnosed as locked-in. Taken together, our results further highlight the clinical potential of resting-state connectivity analysis and might guide the way towards a connectivity measure complementing existing DOC diagnosis},

However, whether CEM has any effect on the intrinsic organization of the brain is not known. In this study, we investigated the effects of CEM on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) using seeds in the limbic network, the default-mode network (DMN) and the salience network, and the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Method Using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) scans were obtained. We defined seeds in the bilateral amygdala, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left dmPFC, and used these to examine whether individuals reporting CEM (n=44) differed from individuals reporting no CEM (n=44) in RSFC with other brain regions. The two groups were matched for age, gender, handedness and the presence of psychopathology. RESULTS: CEM was associated with decreased RSFC between the right amygdala and the bilateral precuneus and a cluster extending from the left insula to the hippocampus and putamen. In addition, CEM was associated with decreased RSFC between the dACC and the precuneus and also frontal regions of the brain. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CEM has a profound effect on RSFC in the limbic network and the salience network.

However, most of the brain's energy consumption is devoted to ongoing metabolic activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or behaviour. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks. Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the 'default' system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.",

    abstract = "The cerebral cortex is anatomically organized at many physical scales starting at the level of single neurons and extending up to functional systems. Current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies often focus at the level of areas, networks, and systems. Except in restricted domains, (e.g., topographically-organized sensory regions), it is difficult to determine area boundaries in the human brain using fMRI. The ability to delineate functional areas non-invasively would enhance the quality of many experimental analyses allowing more accurate across-subject comparisons of independently identified functional areas. Correlations in spontaneous BOLD activity, often referred to as resting state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI), are especially promising as a way to accurately localize differences in patterns of activity across large expanses of cortex. In the current report, we applied a novel set of image analysis tools to explore the utility of rs-fcMRI for defining wide-ranging functional area boundaries. We find that rs-fcMRI patterns show sharp transitions in correlation patterns and that these putative areal boundaries can be reliably detected in individual subjects as well as in group data. Additionally, combining surface-based analysis techniques with image processing algorithms allows automated mapping of putative areal boundaries across large expanses of cortex without the need for prior information about a region's function or topography. Our approach reliably produces maps of bounded regions appropriate in size and number for putative functional areas. These findings will hopefully stimulate further methodological refinements and validations.",

Previous studies have shown that the DMN can be altered by development, aging, disorder, cognitive tasks and off-line training. However, its unclear whether activity in the DMN can be altered by real-time training. Recently, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI), as a novel neurofeedback technique, has been applied to train subjects to voluntarily control activities in specific brain regions. In the current study, it was found that by using rtfMRI to guide training, subjects were able to learn to decrease activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which is a key hub in the DMN, using motor imagery strategy. After the real-time training, activity in the medial prefrontral cortex/ anterior cingulate cortex (MPFC/ACC) of the resting state DMN was decreased. By contrast, the control group without neurofeedback produced increased activity in the MPFC/ACC of the DMN during the post-training resting state. These findings suggest that this rtfMRI technique has great potential to be used in the regulation of the DMN and may be a novel approach for studying functional plasticity of the cortex",

    abstract = "Spatial independent components analysis (sICA) has become a widely applied data-driven method for fMRI data, especially for resting-state studies. These sICA approaches are often based on iterative estimation algorithms and there are concerns about accuracy due to noise. Repeatability measures such as ICASSO, RAICAR and ARABICA have been introduced as remedies but information on their effects on estimates is limited. The contribution of this study was to provide more of such information and test if the repeatability analyses are necessary. We compared FastICA-based ordinary and repeatability approaches concerning mixing vector estimates. Comparisons included original FastICA, FSL4 Melodic FastICA and original and modified ICASSO. The effects of bootstrapping and convergence threshold were evaluated. The results show that there is only moderate improvement due to repeatability measures and only in the bootstrapping case. Bootstrapping attenuated power from time courses of resting-state network related ICs at frequencies higher than 0.1 Hz and made subsets of low frequency oscillations more emphasized IC-wise. The convergence threshold did not have a significant role concerning the accuracy of estimates. The performance results suggest that repeatability measures or strict converge criteria might not be needed in sICA analyses of fMRI data. Consequently, the results in existing sICA fMRI literature are probably valid in this sense. A decreased accuracy of original bootstrapping ICASSO was observed and corrected by using centrotype mixing estimates but the results warrant for thorough evaluations of data-driven methods in general. Also, given the fMRI-specific considerations, further development of sICA methods is strongly encouraged.",

    abstract = "Signal fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can result from a number of sources that may have a neuronal, physiologic or instrumental origin. To determine the relative contribution of these sources, we recorded physiological (respiration and cardiac) signals simultaneously with fMRI in human volunteers at rest with their eyes closed. State-of-the-art technology was used including high magnetic field (7 T), a multichannel detector array and high-resolution (3 mm(3)) echo-planar imaging. We investigated the relative contribution of thermal noise and other sources of variance to the observed fMRI signal fluctuations both in the visual cortex and in the whole brain gray matter. The following sources of variance were evaluated separately: low-frequency drifts due to scanner instability, effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac cycles, effects due to variability in the respiratory flow rate and cardiac rate, and other sources, tentatively attributed to spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that low-frequency drifts are the most significant source of fMRI signal fluctuations (3.0\% signal change in the visual cortex, TE=32 ms), followed by spontaneous neuronal activity (2.9\%), thermal noise (2.1\%), effects due to variability in physiological rates (respiration 0.9\%, heartbeat 0.9\%), and correlated with physiological cycles (0.6\%). We suggest the selection and use of four lagged physiological noise regressors as an effective model to explain the variance related to fluctuations in the rates of respiration volume change and cardiac pulsation. Our results also indicate that, compared to the whole brain gray matter, the visual cortex has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of respiration and the spontaneous resting-state activity. Under the conditions of this study, spontaneous neuronal activity is one of the major contributors to the measured fMRI signal fluctuations, increasing almost twofold relative to earlier experiments under similar conditions at 3 T.",

We investigated the effect of SD on functional connectivity within the DMN, and on DMN-ACN anti-correlation, both during the resting state and during performance of a visual attention task (VAT). 26 healthy participants underwent fMRI twice: once after a normal night of sleep in rested wakefulness (RW) and once following approximately 24h of total SD. A seed-based approach was used to examine pairwise correlations of low-frequency fMRI signal across different nodes in each state. SD was associated with significant selective reductions in DMN functional connectivity and DMN-ACN anti-correlation. This was congruent across resting state and VAT analyses, suggesting that SD induces a robust alteration in the intrinsic connectivity within and between these networks",

Here, we report two experiments that explore the relationships between instrumental and cognitive variables and the monofractal and multifractal parameters of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired in a no-task or resting state. First, we show that the Hurst exponent is greater in grey matter than in white matter regions, and it is maximal in grey matter when data were acquired with an echo time known to optimise BOLD contrast. Second, we show that latency of response in a fame decision/facial encoding task was negatively correlated with the Hurst exponent of resting state data acquired 30 min after task performance. This association was localised to a right inferior frontal cortical region activated by the fame decision task and indicated that people with shorter response latency had more persistent dynamics (higher values of H). Multifractal analysis revealed that faster responding participants had wider singularity spectra of resting fMRI time series in inferior frontal cortex. Endogenous brain oscillations measured by fMRI have monofractal and multifractal properties that can be related to instrumental and cognitive factors in a way, which indicates that these low frequency dynamics are relevant to neurocognitive function.",

In this study, we used the high spatial resolution and full brain coverage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to understand the origins and commonalities of these fluctuations. Specifically, we applied a newly developed method, regressor interpolation at progressive time delays, to analyze concurrently recorded fNIRS and fMRI data acquired both in a resting state study and in a finger tapping study. The method calculates the voxelwise correlations between blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI and fNIRS signals with different time shifts and localizes the areas in the brain that highly correlate with the fNIRS signal recorded at the surface of the head. The results show the wide spatial distribution of this physiological fluctuation in BOLD data, both in task and resting states. The brain areas that are highly correlated with global physiological fluctuations observed by fNIRS have a pattern that resembles the venous system of the brain, indicating the blood fluctuation from veins on the brain surface might strongly contribute to the overall fNIRS signal.",

    abstract = "Homeostasis of the human stress response system is critically maintained by a hierarchical system of neural and endocrine elements for which intact negative feedback is important to prevent maladaptation towards stress. Such feedback is efficiently probed by the established combined dexamethasone-suppression/corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test. Here we investigate which suprahypothalamic networks might modulate the response assessed by this neuroendocrine test. Combined resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)/EEG was acquired in 20 healthy male volunteers along with dex/CRH profiles obtained on a different day outside the scanner. Seed-based network analysis and inter-seed cross correlation analysis for selected atlas-based limbic, paralimbic and medial prefrontal cortex seeds were correlated with stimulated cortisol and adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations. Lower connectivity between a left hippocampus-based network and the right hippocampus significantly predicted stimulated cortisol concentration (R(2)=0.70, corrected p(cluster)=0.001). Six further significantly negative correlations were detected mainly in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The strongest positive correlation with stimulated hormone concentration was detected for the left subcallosal ACC (ACTH, R(2)=0.57, corrected p(cluster)=0.009). Inter-seed connectivity mainly pointed to hippocampal/amygdala interactions as correlates of the dex/CRH response. In conclusion, resting state functional connectivity patterns of limbic, particularly hippocampal, as well as cingulate and medial prefrontal areas can explain some of the variance of the dex/CRH test in healthy subjects. Functional connectivity analysis can be considered useful to study supra-hypothalamic control systems of the HPA axis",

Although mounting evidence points towards a neuronal contribution to this activity, its functional role and dependence on behavioral state remain unclear. In this work, we used BOLD fMRI at 7 T to study the modulation of spontaneous activity in occipital areas by various behavioral conditions, including resting with eyes closed, eyes open with visual fixation, and eyes open with fixation and focal visual stimulation. Spontaneous activity was separated from evoked activity and from signal fluctuations related to cardiac and respiratory cycles. We found that spontaneous activity in visual areas was substantially reduced (amplitude (44\%) and coherence (25\%)) with the fixation conditions relative to the eyes-closed condition. No significant further modulation was observed when the visual stimulus was added. The observed dependence on behavioral condition suggests that part of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations represents neuronal activity. Possible mechanisms for the modulation of spontaneous activity by behavioral state are discussed. The observed linear superposition of spontaneous fMRI activity with focal evoked activity related to visual processing has important implications for fMRI studies, which ideally should take into account the effect of spontaneous activity to properly define brain activations during task conditions.",

In this study we have taken a systematic approach to examining how alterations in functional connectivity vary across the functionally diverse subregions of the rostral cingulate cortex. Method Eighteen patients with major depressive disorder, aged 15 to 24 years, were matched with 20 healthy control participants. Using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), we systematically investigated the functional connectivity of four subregions of the rostral cingulate cortex. Voxelwise statistical maps of each subregion's connectivity with other brain areas were compared between the patient and control groups.RESULTS: The depressed participants showed altered patterns of connectivity with ventral cingulate subregions. They showed increased connectivity between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial frontal cortex, with connectivity strength showing positive correlation with illness severity. Depressed participants also showed increased connectivity between pregenual ACC and left dorsolateral frontal cortex, and decreased connectivity between pregenual ACC and the caudate nucleus bilaterally.CONCLUSIONS: The results reinforce the importance of subgenual ACC for depression, and show a close link between brain regions that support self-related processes and affective visceromotor function. The pregenual ACC also has an important role, with its increased connectivity with dorsolateral frontal cortex suggesting heightened cognitive regulation of affect; and reduced connectivity with the caudate nucleus potentially underlying symptoms such as anhedonia, reduced motivation and psychomotor dysfunction",

We studied brain functional connectivity, by means of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, in patients with Parkinson's disease and freezing of gait. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T was collected in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom 16 presented with freezing of gait as determined by a validated freezing of gait questionnaire, and 15 matched healthy controls. Single-subject and group-level independent component analysis was used to identify the main resting-state networks differing between Parkinson's disease patients with and without freezing of gait. Statistical analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX. RESULTS: Between-group differences in resting-state networks revealed that patients with freezing of gait exhibit significantly reduced functional connectivity within both "executive-attention" (in the right middle frontal gyrus and in the angular gyrus) and visual networks (in the right occipito-temporal gyrus) [p < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons]. Freezing of gait clinical severity was significantly correlated with decreased connectivity within the two networks. Consistent with their "executive-attention" network impairment, patients with freezing of gait scored lower on tests of frontal lobe functions (phonemic verbal fluency: p = 0.005; frontal assessment battery: p < 0.001; ten point clock test: p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a resting-state functional connectivity disruption of "executive-attention" and visual neural networks may be associated with the development of freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease},

    abstract = "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) with neurofeedback allows investigation of human brain neuroplastic changes that arise as subjects learn to modulate neurophysiological function using real-time feedback regarding their own hemodynamic responses to stimuli. We investigated the feasibility of training healthy humans to self-regulate the hemodynamic activity of the amygdala, which plays major roles in emotional processing. Participants in the experimental group were provided with ongoing information about the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in the left amygdala (LA) and were instructed to raise the BOLD rtfMRI signal by contemplating positive autobiographical memories. A control group was assigned the same task but was instead provided with sham feedback from the left horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (HIPS) region. In the LA, we found a significant BOLD signal increase due to rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the experimental group versus the control group. This effect persisted during the Transfer run without neurofeedback. For the individual subjects in the experimental group the training effect on the LA BOLD activity correlated inversely with scores on the Difficulty Identifying Feelings subscale of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. The whole brain data analysis revealed significant differences for Happy Memories versus Rest condition between the experimental and control groups. Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala network revealed significant widespread correlations in a fronto-temporo-limbic network. Additionally, we identified six regions--right medial frontal polar cortex, bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, and bilateral superior frontal gyrus--where the functional connectivity with the LA increased significantly across the rtfMRI neurofeedback runs and the Transfer run. The findings demonstrate that healthy subjects can learn to regulate their amygdala activation using rtfMRI neurofeedback, suggesting possible applications of rtfMRI neurofeedback training in the treatment of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders",

    abstract = "Many neuroimaging investigations focus on hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, few investigate default-mode network (DMN) in the patients with HE and its underlying physiological relevance using resting-state fMRI. In this study, independent component analysis was used to retrieve components representing the DMN of patients with HE (n = 14) and healthy volunteers (n = 14). Four patients were excluded because of head motion (n = 3) and the artifact from the artificial tooth (n = 1). Comparison results between the two groups revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex in the HE patients. A statistical t-map from the comparison of venous blood ammonia levels and the z-scores of the DMN obtained from independent component analysis was computed in the HE group, which showed negative correlation with the changes in left angular gyrus. In conclusions, resting-state fMRI can be used to examine DMN changes in HE patients. Reduced functional connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex consisting of the DMN and negative correlation between the functional connectivity changes in left AG and the venous blood ammonia levels support the notion of damages in functional organization of the central nervous system in HE patients. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    abstract = "Apolipoprotein (APOE) ɛ4-related differences in memory performance have been detected before age 65. The hippocampus and the surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures are the first site affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the MTL is the seat of episodic memory, including visuo-spatial memory. While reports of APOE ɛ4-related differences in these brain structures are not consistent in either cross-sectional or longitudinal structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, there is increasing evidence that brain activity at baseline (defined as activity during fixation or rest) may differ in APOE ɛ4 carriers compared to non-carriers. In this fMRI study, cognitively normal APOE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers engaged in a perspective-dependent spatial learning task (Shelton \& Gabrieli, 2002) previously shown to activate MTL structures in older participants (Borghesani et al., 2008). A low-level, visually engaging dot-control task was used for comparison, in addition to fixation. APOE ɛ4 carriers showed less activation than non-carriers in the hippocampus proper during encoding. Specifically, when spatial encoding was contrasted against the dot-control task, encoding-related activation was significantly lower in carriers than non-carriers. By contrast, no ɛ4-related differences in the hippocampus were found when spatial encoding was compared with fixation. Lower activation, however, was not global since encoding-related activation in early visual cortex (left lingual gyrus) was not different between APOE ɛ4 carriers and non-carriers. The present data document APOE ɛ4-related differences in the hippocampus proper during encoding and underscore the role of low-level control contrasts for complex encoding tasks. These results have implications for fMRI studies that investigate the default-mode network (DMN) in middle-aged to older APOE ɛ4 carriers to help evaluate AD risk in this otherwise cognitively normal population",

Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), graph theory was applied to construct the resting networks in 16 first-episode and unmedicated adolescents with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HC). Our results showed that the topological properties of depressed adolescents' networks were significantly disrupted compared with HC. Dysregulation of brain regions were found in the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral, medial and inferior prefrontal cortex, insula, amygdala, and the temporal cortices. Furthermore, the connectivity degree of amygdala related functional connection was positively correlated with the duration of depression. Detection and estimation of these functional impairments may advance our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of adolescent MDD.",

Using resting-state fMRI, we investigated whether cerebral network characteristics are associated with epilepsy and cognitive comorbidity. We included 37 children with FLE and 41 healthy age-matched controls. Cognitive performance was determined by means of a computerized visual searching task. A connectivity matrix for 82 cortical and subcortical brain regions was generated for each subject by calculating the inter-regional correlation of the fMRI time signals. From the connectivity matrix, graph metrics were calculated and the anatomical configuration of aberrant connections and modular organization was investigated. Both patients and controls displayed efficiently organized networks. However, FLE patients displayed a higher modularity, implying that subnetworks are less interconnected. Impaired cognition was associated with higher modularity scores and abnormal modular organization of the brain, which was mainly expressed as a decrease in long-range and an increase in interhemispheric connectivity in patients. We showed that network modularity analysis provides a sensitive marker for cognitive impairment in FLE and suggest that abnormally interconnected functional subnetworks of the brain might underlie the cognitive problems in children with FLE",

Significantly increased coherence (ReHo) was found in the left middle occipital gyrus, which would be consistent with their hypervigilance and hyperprosexia to the social communication even in the resting state.

Subsequent research revealed consistent abnormalities in cortical gray and white matter volume in ASDs. The structural integrity and orientation of white matter have been further elucidated via diffusion tensor imaging methods. The emergence of functional MRI techniques led to an enhanced understanding of the neural circuitry of ASDs, demonstrating areas of dysfunctional cortical activation and atypical cortical specialization. These studies have provided evidence of underconnectivity in distributed cortical networks integral to the core impairments associated with ASDs. Abnormalities in the default-mode network during the resting state have also been identified. Overall, structural and functional MRI research has generated important insights into the neurobiology of ASDs.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies have provided consistent support for the idea that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with disturbances of brain corticostriatal systems. However, in general, these studies have not sought to account for the disorder's prominent clinical heterogeneity. METHODS: To address these concerns, we investigated the influence of major OCD symptom dimensions on brain corticostriatal functional systems in a large sample of OCD patients (n = 74) and control participants (n = 74) examined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We employed a valid method for mapping ventral and dorsal striatal functional connectivity, which supported both standard group comparisons and linear regression analyses with patients' scores on the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. RESULTS: Consistent with past findings, patients demonstrated a common connectivity alteration involving the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex that predicted overall illness severity levels. This common alteration was independent of the effect of particular symptom dimensions. Instead, we observed distinct anatomical relationships between the severity of symptom dimensions and striatal functional connectivity. Aggression symptoms modulated connectivity between the ventral striatum, amygdala, and ventromedial frontal cortex, while sexual/religious symptoms had a specific influence on ventral striatal-insular connectivity. Hoarding modulated the strength of ventral and dorsal striatal connectivity with distributed frontal regions. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that pathophysiological changes among orbitofrontal-striatal regions may be common to all forms of OCD. They suggest that a further examination of certain dimensional relationships will also be relevant for advancing current neurobiological models of the disorder",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is considered to be the prototypical central chronic pain syndrome and is associated with widespread pain that fluctuates spontaneously. Multiple studies have demonstrated altered brain activity in these patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of connectivity between multiple brain networks in patients with FM, as well as how activity in these networks correlates with the level of spontaneous pain. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data from 18 patients with FM and 18 age-matched healthy control subjects were analyzed using dual-regression independent components analysis, which is a data-driven approach for the identification of independent brain networks. Intrinsic, or resting-state, connectivity was evaluated in multiple brain networks: the default mode network (DMN), the executive attention network (EAN), and the medial visual network (MVN), with the MVN serving as a negative control. Spontaneous pain levels were also analyzed for covariance with intrinsic connectivity. RESULTS: Patients with FM had greater connectivity within the DMN and right EAN (corrected P [P(corr)] < 0.05 versus controls), and greater connectivity between the DMN and the insular cortex, which is a brain region known to process evoked pain. Furthermore, greater intensity of spontaneous pain at the time of the FMRI scan correlated with greater intrinsic connectivity between the insula and both the DMN and right EAN (P(corr) < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that resting brain activity within multiple networks is associated with spontaneous clinical pain in patients with FM. These findings may also have broader implications for how subjective experiences such as pain arise from a complex interplay among multiple brain networks.",

Distinct frontal-striatal-thalamic loops through cortical centers for cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex) and emotion processing (ventral medial frontal cortex) follow unique maturational trajectories, and altered connectivity within distinct loops may be differentially associated with OCD at specific stages of development. METHOD: Altered development of striatal and thalamic connectivity to medial frontal cortex was tested in 60 OCD patients compared with 61 healthy control subjects at child, adolescent, and adult stages of development, using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. RESULTS: OCD in the youngest patients was associated with reduced connectivity of dorsal striatum and medial dorsal thalamus to rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, respectively. Increased connectivity of dorsal striatum to ventral medial frontal cortex was observed in patients at all developmental stages. In child patients, reduced connectivity between dorsal striatum and rostral anterior cingulate cortex correlated with OCD severity. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal-striatal-thalamic loops involved in cognitive control are hypoconnected in young patients near illness onset, whereas loops implicated in emotion processing are hyperconnected throughout the illness",

Here we propose a method based on the conditional mutual information (CMI) in the frequency domain. CMI maps quantify the amount of non-redundant covariability between each site and all others in the rest of the brain, partialling out the joint variability due to gross physiological noise. Average maps from a sample of 45 healthy individuals scanned in the resting state show a clear and symmetric pattern of connectivity maxima in several regions of cortex, including prefrontal, orbitofrontal, lateral-parietal, and midline default mode network components; and in subcortical nuclei, including the amygdala, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Such cortical and subcortical hotspots of functional connectivity were more clearly evident at lower frequencies (0.02-0.1 Hz) than at higher frequencies (0.1-0.2 Hz) of endogenous oscillation. CMI mapping can also be easily applied to perform group analyses. This is exemplified by exploring effects of normal aging on CMI in a sample of healthy controls and by investigating correlations between CMI and positive psychotic symptom scores in a sample of 40 schizophrenic patients. Both the normative aging and schizophrenia studies reveal functional connectivity trends that converge with reported findings from other studies, thus giving further support to the validity of the proposed method",

    abstract = {Recent studies have identified large scale brain networks based on the spatio-temporal structure of spontaneous fluctuations in resting-state fMRI data. It is expected that functional connectivity based on resting-state data is reflective of - but not identical to - the underlying anatomical connectivity. However, which functional connectivity analysis methods reliably predict the network structure remains unclear. Here we tested and compared network connectivity analysis methods by applying them to fMRI resting-state time-series obtained from the human visual cortex. The methods evaluated here are those previously tested against simulated data in Smith et al. (Neuroimage, 2011). To this end, we defined regions within retinotopic visual areas V1, V2, and V3 according to their eccentricity in the visual field, delineating central, intermediate, and peripheral eccentricity regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs served as nodes in the models we study. We based our evaluation on the "ground-truth", thoroughly studied retinotopically-organized anatomical connectivity in the monkey visual cortex. For each evaluated method, we computed the fractional rate of detecting connections known to exist ("c-sensitivity"), while using a threshold of the 95th percentile of the distribution of interaction magnitudes of those connections not expected to exist. Under optimal conditions - including session duration of 68minutes, a relatively small network consisting of 9 nodes and artifact-free regression of the global effect - each of the top methods predicted the expected connections with 67\%-85\% c-sensitivity. Correlation methods, including Correlation (Corr; 85\%), Regularized Inverse Covariance (ICOV; 84\%) and Partial Correlation (PCorr; 81\%) performed best, followed by Patel's Kappa (80\%), Bayesian Network method PC (BayesNet; 77\%), General Synchronization measures (67-77\%), and Coherence (CohB; 74\%). With decreased session duration, these top methods saw decreases in c-sensitivities, achieving 59\%-76\% for 17minute sessions. With a short resting-state fMRI scan of 8.5minutes, none of the methods predicted the real network well, with Corr (65\%) performing best. With increased complexity of the network from 9 to 36 nodes, multivariate methods including PCorr and BayesNet saw a decrease in performance. Artifact-free regression of the global effect increased the c-sensitivity of the top-performing methods. In an overall evaluation across all tests we performed, correlation methods (Corr, ICOV, and PCorr), Patel's Kappa, and BayesNet method PC set themselves somewhat above all other methods. We propose that data-based calibration based on known anatomical connections be integrated into future network studies, in order to maximize sensitivity and reduce false positives},

We investigated the role of altered FC of default mode sub-networks (DM-SNs) in 16 patients with high-functioning ASD compared to 16 matched healthy controls of short resting fMRI scans using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a multivariate data-driven approach that identifies temporally coherent networks, providing a natural measure of FC. Results show that compared to controls, patients showed decreased FC between the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, DMN core areas, and other DM-SNs areas. FC magnitude in these regions inversely correlated with the severity of patients' social and communication deficits as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule and the Social Responsiveness Scale. Importantly, supplemental analyses suggest that these results were independent of treatment status. These results support the hypothesis that DM-SNs under-connectivity contributes to the core deficits seen in ASD. Moreover, these data provide further support for the use of data-driven analysis with resting-state data for illuminating neural systems that differ between groups. This approach seems especially well suited for populations where compliance with and performance of active tasks might be a challenge, as it requires minimal cooperation.",

    abstract = {Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous, resting-state time course of the default-mode network is negatively correlated with that of the "task-positive network", a collection of regions commonly recruited in demanding cognitive tasks. However, all studies of negative correlations between the default-mode and task-positive networks have employed some form of normalization or regression of the whole-brain average signal ("global signal"); these processing steps alter the time series of voxels in an uninterpretable manner as well as introduce spurious negative correlations. Thus, the extent of negative correlations with the default mode network without global signal removal has not been well characterized, and it is has recently been hypothesized that the apparent negative correlations in many of the task-positive regions could be artifactually induced by global signal pre-processing. The present study aimed to examine negative and positive correlations with the default-mode network when model-based corrections for respiratory and cardiac noise are applied in lieu of global signal removal. Physiological noise correction consisted of (1) removal of time-locked cardiac and respiratory artifacts using RETROICOR (Glover, G.H., Li, T.Q., Ress, D., 2000. Image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects in fMRI: RETROICOR. Magn. Reson. Med. 44, 162-167), and (2) removal of low-frequency respiratory and heart rate variations by convolving these waveforms with pre-determined transfer functions (Birn et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2009) and projecting the resulting two signals out of the data. It is demonstrated that negative correlations between the default-mode network and regions of the task-positive network are present in the majority of individual subjects both with and without physiological noise correction. Physiological noise correction increased the spatial extent and magnitude of negative correlations, yielding negative correlations within task-positive regions at the group-level (p<0.05, uncorrected; no regions at the group level were significant at FDR=0.05). Furthermore, physiological noise correction caused region-specific decreases in positive correlations within the default-mode network, reducing apparent false positives. It was observed that the low-frequency respiratory volume and cardiac rate regressors used within the physiological noise correction algorithm displayed significant (but not total) shared variance with the global signal, and constitute a model-based alternative to correcting for non-neural global noise},

    abstract = "Consensus across hundreds of published studies indicates that the same cortical regions are involved in many forms of cognitive control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that these coactive regions form a functionally connected cognitive control network (CCN). Network status was identified by convergent methods, including: high inter-regional correlations during rest and task performance, consistently higher correlations within the CCN than the rest of cortex, co-activation in a visual search task, and mutual sensitivity to decision difficulty. Regions within the CCN include anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area (ACC/pSMA), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal junction (IFJ), anterior insular cortex (AIC), dorsal pre-motor cortex (dPMC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We used a novel visual line search task which included periods when the probe stimuli were occluded but subjects had to maintain and update working memory in preparation for the sudden appearance of a probe stimulus. The six CCN regions operated as a tightly coupled network during the 'non-occluded' portions of this task, with all regions responding to probe events. In contrast, the network was differentiated during occluded search. DLPFC, not ACC/pSMA, was involved in target memory maintenance when probes were absent, while both regions became active in preparation for difficult probes at the end of each occluded period. This approach illustrates one way in which a neuronal network can be identified, its high functional connectivity established, and its components dissociated in order to better understand the interactive and specialized internal mechanisms of that network",

The pattern of intrinsic brain activity was measured by examining the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level dependent signal during rest. There were widespread ALFF differences among the three groups throughout the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Both AD and MCI patients showed decreased activity mainly in the medial parietal lobe region and lentiform nucleus, while there was increased activity in the lateral temporal regions and superior frontal and parietal regions as compared with controls. Compared with MCI, the AD patients showed decreased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus and inferior and superior temporal gyri. Specifically, the most significant ALFF differences among the groups appeared in the posterior cingulate cortex, with a reduced pattern of activity when comparing healthy controls, MCI, and AD patients. Additionally, we also showed that the regions with ALFF changes had significant correlations with the cognitive performance of patients as measured by mini-mental state examination scores. Finally, while taking gray matter volume as covariates, the ALFF results were approximately consistent with those without gray matter correction, implying that the functional analysis could not be explained by regional atrophy. Together, our results demonstrate that there is a specific pattern of ALFF in AD and MCI, thus providing insights into biological mechanisms of the diseases",

    abstract = "Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies has yet to be established. This article introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous FC. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce FC patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for FC analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1,000) most accurately represent FC patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy.

Meta-awareness and regulation of mind-wandering are core cognitive components of most contemplative practices and to study their impact on DMN activity, we collected functional MRI (fMRI) data from a cohort of experienced Zen meditators and meditation-naive controls engaging in a basic attention-to-breathing protocol. We observed a significant group difference in the skewness of the fMRI BOLD signal from the vPMC, suggesting that the relative incidence of states of elevated vPMC activity was lower in meditators; furthermore, the same parameter was significantly correlated with performance on a rapid visual information processing (RVIP) test for sustained attention conducted outside the scanner. Finally, a functional connectivity analysis with the vPMC seed revealed a significant association of RVIP performance with the degree of temporal correlation between vPMC and the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), a region strongly implicated in stimulus-triggered reorienting of attention. Together, these findings suggest that the vPMC BOLD signal skewness and the temporal relationship of vPMC and TPJ activities reflect the dynamic tension between mind-wandering, meta-awareness, and directed attention, and may represent a useful endophenotype for studying individual differences in attentional abilities and the impairment of the latter in specific clinical conditions",

    abstract = "Personality describes persistent human behavioral responses to broad classes of environmental stimuli. Investigating how personality traits are reflected in the brain's functional architecture is challenging, in part due to the difficulty of designing appropriate task probes. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) can detect intrinsic activation patterns without relying on any specific task. Here we use RSFC to investigate the neural correlates of the five-factor personality domains. Based on seed regions placed within two cognitive and affective 'hubs' in the brain-the anterior cingulate and precuneus-each domain of personality predicted RSFC with a unique pattern of brain regions. These patterns corresponded with functional subdivisions responsible for cognitive and affective processing such as motivation, empathy and future-oriented thinking. Neuroticism and Extraversion, the two most widely studied of the five constructs, predicted connectivity between seed regions and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and lateral paralimbic regions, respectively. These areas are associated with emotional regulation, self-evaluation and reward, consistent with the trait qualities. Personality traits were mostly associated with functional connections that were inconsistently present across participants. This suggests that although a fundamental, core functional architecture is preserved across individuals, variable connections outside of that core encompass the inter-individual differences in personality that motivate diverse responses. © 2011 Adelstein et al.",

For each condition, phase plane plots, cross correlation functions, and connectivity indices were generated for O2Hb, HHb, and tHb. The amplitude of the concentration changes in O2Hb and HHb depends on the age of the subject. We found large regions of connectivity, which were similar for resting state and task conditions. This means the spatial relationships during resting state, when changes in O2Hb, HHb, and tHb corresponded to spontaneous oscillations, were correlated to the spatial patterns during the activation tasks, when changes in O2Hb, HHb, and tHb concentration were related to the alternation of stimulation and rest. Thus, the vascular functional connectivity was also present during resting state.

    abstract = "The functional connectivity (FC) method was used to investigate the changes in the resting state of patients with vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia (VCIND). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (fMRIs) were acquired from 16 patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) who fulfilled the criteria for VCIND, as well as 18 age- and sex-matched subjects with SIVD with no cognitive impairment (control group). Posterior cingulate cortex connectivity was gathered by investigating synchronic low-frequency fMRI signal fluctuations with a temporal correlation method. Compared with the control group, the patients showed FC decrease in the left middle temporal gyrus, the left anterior cingulate/left middle frontal gyrus, the right caudate, the right middle frontal gyrus, and the left medial frontal gyrus/paracentral lobule. There were also some regions that showed increased connectivity. These regions included the right inferior temporal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus, the left precentral gyrus, and the left superior parietal lobule. Our findings revealed the change in resting-state patterns of neuronal activity in patients with VCIND. This change may be caused by subcortical white matter lesions that destroyed direct and indirect fiber tract connectivity across the cerebral white matter and influenced the cortical FC and hypoperfusion resulted from small vascular disease. The results of the increased connectivity may be evoked by the compensatory recruitment and plasticity mechanism. Our findings suggest that the simplicity and noninvasiveness of this method makes it a potential tool to help thoroughly understand the pathogenesis of VCIND.",

    abstract = "Synchronized low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations of the functional MRI (fMRI) signal have recently been applied to investigate large-scale neuronal networks of the brain in the absence of specific task instructions. However, the underlying neural mechanisms of these fluctuations remain largely unknown. To this end, electrophysiological recordings and resting-state fMRI measurements were conducted in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. Using a seed-voxel analysis strategy, region-specific, anesthetic dose-dependent fMRI resting-state functional connectivity was detected in bilateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL) of the resting brain. Cortical electroencephalographic signals were also recorded from bilateral S1FL; a visual cortex locus served as a control site. Results demonstrate that, unlike the evoked fMRI response that correlates with power changes in the gamma bands, the resting-state fMRI signal correlates with the power coherence in low-frequency bands, particularly the delta band. These data indicate that hemodynamic fMRI signal differentially registers specific electrical oscillatory frequency band activity, suggesting that fMRI may be able to distinguish the ongoing from the evoked activity of the brain.",

While the D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) gene can affect glutamatergic function, its genetic associations with MDD and abnormal resting-state brain activity have yet to be elucidated. A total of 488 patients with MDD and 480 controls were recruited to examine MDD association for the DAOA gene in a Chinese population, of whom 53 medication-free patients and 46 well-matched controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging for regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis. The differences in ReHo between genotypes of interest were initially tested by the Student's t test, and the 2 × 2 (genotypes × disease status) ANOVA was then performed to identify the main effects of genotypes, disease status, and their interactions in MDD. Allelic association of the DAOA gene with MDD was observed for rs2391191, rs3918341, and rs778294 and haplotypic association for 2- and 3-SNP haplotypes. Six clusters in the cerebellum, right middle frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus showed genotypic association between altered ReHo and rs2391191. The main effects of rs2391191 genotypes were found in the right culmen and right middle frontal gyrus. The left uvula and left middle temporal gyrus showed a genotypes × disease status interaction. Our results suggest that the DAOA gene may confer genetic risk of MDD. Genotypic effect of rs2391191 and its interaction with disease status may contribute to the altered ReHo in patients with MDD. Glutamatergic modulation may play an important role in alteration of the resting-state brain activities",

    abstract = "The thalamus plays a central and dynamic role in information transmission and processing in the brain. Multiple studies reveal increasing association between schizophrenia and dysfunction of the thalamus, in particular the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN), and its projection targets. The medial dorsal thalamic connections to the prefrontal cortex are of particular interest, and explicit in vivo evidence of this connection in healthy humans is sparse. Additionally, recent neuroimaging evidence has demonstrated disconnection among a variety of cortical regions in schizophrenia, though the MDN thalamic prefrontal cortex network has not been extensively probed in schizophrenia. To this end, we have examined thalamo-anterior cingulate cortex connectivity using detection of low-frequency blood oxygen level dependence fluctuations (LFBF) during a resting-state paradigm. Eleven schizophrenic patients and 12 healthy control participants were enrolled in a study of brain thalamocortical connectivity. Resting-state data were collected, and seed-based connectivity analysis was performed to identify the thalamocortical network. First, we have shown there is MDN thalamocortical connectivity in healthy controls, thus demonstrating that LFBF analysis is a manner to probe the thalamocortical network. Additionally, we have found there is statistically significantly reduced thalamocortical connectivity in schizophrenics compared with matched healthy controls. We did not observe any significant difference in motor networks between groups. We have shown that the thalamocortical network is observable using resting-state connectivity in healthy controls and that this network is altered in schizophrenia. These data support a disruption model of the thalamocortical network and are consistent with a disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia.",

    abstract = "PURPOSE: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the ability of a novel method of cluster analysis, 2dTCA, for identifying and characterizing peak fluctuations in fMRI BOLD signals in the temporal lobes and the default-mode network in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) without EEG.METHODS: BOLD fMRI images were acquired in 17 TLE patients and compared to EEG. The timing of significant transient BOLD peaks was estimated by 2dTCA, and activation maps were determined.RESULTS: Sixteen subjects (94\%) showed apparent temporal lobe activation. Mesial temporal activation was present in 76.4\% (13 patients). Temporal lobe or insula activations were detected ipsilateral to the EEG focus in 64.7\% (11 patients), bilaterally with no predominance in 29.4\% (5 patients), and exclusively contralateral to the EEG focus in none. Eleven subjects showed activation in the so-called default-mode network including posterior cingulate, bilateral posterior parietal cortex, and sometimes anterior cingulate cortex.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate significant positive BOLD fluctuations in the temporal lobes and default-mode regions in a higher percentage of TLE patients than previously reported using other methods. These fluctuations appear physiologically relevant and suggest increased neural activity which may not be detected on scalp EEG, but which may be important in understanding the mechanisms and origins of epileptic discharges",

    abstract = "Major depressive disorder (MDD) begins frequently in adolescence and is associated with severe outcomes, but the developmental neurobiology of MDD is not well understood. Research in adults has implicated fronto-limbic neural networks in the pathophysiology of MDD, particularly in relation to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Developmental changes in brain networks during adolescence highlight the need to examine MDD-related circuitry in teens separately from adults. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study examined functional connectivity in adolescents with MDD (n=12) and healthy adolescents (n=14). Seed-based connectivity analysis revealed that adolescents with MDD have decreased functional connectivity in a subgenual ACC-based neural network that includes the supragenual ACC (BA 32), the right medial frontal cortex (BA 10), the left inferior (BA 47) and superior frontal cortex (BA 22), superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and the insular cortex (BA 13). These preliminary data suggest that MDD in adolescence is associated with abnormal connectivity within neural circuits that mediate emotion processing. Future research in larger, un-medicated samples will be necessary to confirm this finding. We conclude that hypothesis-driven, seed-based analyses of resting state fMRI data hold promise for advancing our current understanding of abnormal development of neural circuitry in adolescents with MDD.",

Its activity is boosted upon threat exposure and contributes to a neuroendocrine stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Corticosteroids are known to control brain activity as well as HPA activity by providing negative feedback to the brain. However, it is unknown how corticosteroids affect the neural circuitry connected to the amygdala. Implementing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, we here investigated the effects of 10-mg hydrocortisone on amygdala-centered functional connectivity patterns in men using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed generally decreased functional connectivity of the amygdala by corticosteroids. Hydrocortisone reduced "positive" functional coupling of the amygdala to brain regions involved in the initiation and maintenance of the stress response; the locus coeruleus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Furthermore, hydrocortisone reduced "negative" functional coupling of the amygdala to the middle frontal and temporal gyrus; brain regions known to be involved in executive control. A control analysis did not show significant corticosteroid modulation of visual cortex coupling, indicating that the amygdala decoupling was not reflecting a general reduction of network connectivity. These results suggest that corticosteroids may reduce amygdala's impact on brain processing in the aftermath of stress in men.},

Furthermore, we showed that the lateral/medial volumes of dorsal anterior and dorsal posterior precuneus are each connected with areas of motor execution/attention and motor/visual imagery, respectively. Compared to the ventral precuneus, the dorsal precuneus showed greater connectivity with occipital and posterior parietal cortices, but less connectivity with the medial superior frontal and orbitofrontal gyri, anterior cingulate cortex as well as the parahippocampus. Compared to dorsal-posterior and ventral precuneus, the dorsal-anterior precuneus showed greater connectivity with the somatomotor cortex, as well as the insula, supramarginal, Heschl's, and superior temporal gyri, but less connectivity with the angular gyrus. Compared to ventral and dorsal-anterior precuneus, dorsal-posterior precuneus showed greater connectivity with the middle frontal gyrus. Notably, the precuneus as a whole has negative connectivity with the amygdala and the lateral and inferior orbital frontal gyri. Finally, men and women differed in the connectivity of precuneus. Men and women each showed greater connectivity with the dorsal precuneus in the cuneus and medial thalamus, respectively. Women also showed greater connectivity with ventral precuneus in the hippocampus/parahippocampus, middle/anterior cingulate gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, compared to men. Taken together, these new findings may provide a useful platform upon which to further investigate sex-specific functional neuroanatomy of the precuneus and to elucidate the pathology of many neurological illnesses. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

RESULTS: The findings from 16 resting-state fMRI studies on MD are tabulated. Some common findings are discussed in further detail. CONCLUSION: The use of resting-state fMRI in MD research has yielded a number of significant findings that provide the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. Of particular note and deserving of further research are the roles of the cortico-limbic mood regulating circuit (MRC) and the interaction between task-positive and task-negative networks in MD. There is increasing interest in the use of resting-state fMRI in the study of psychiatric conditions, and continued improvement in technique and methodology will prove valuable in future research",

Interictal brain fMRI was performed in the PKC patients and in the normal controls. Voxel-based analysis was used to characterize the alteration of amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in patients with PKC. Difference between the patient patterns and the control was analyzed with Student t-test. The whole brain analysis indicated that the patient group had significantly increased ALFF in the bilateral putamen (P < 0.005) than normal control. fMRI could be useful to evaluate PKC with negative conventional imaging. It was suggested that abnormal cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loop might be associated with the pathophysiology of idiopathic PKC.",

The changing frequency composition of the resting state EEG reflects maturation of brain function. This study investigated (post)adolescent brain maturation captured by two independently but simultaneously recorded neuronal signals: EEG and fMRI. Data were collected in a 20 min eyes-open/eyes-closed resting state paradigm. EEG, fMRI-BOLD signal and EEG-BOLD correlations were compared between groups of adults, age 25 (n=18), and adolescents, age 15 (n=18). A typical developmental decrease of low-frequency EEG power was observed even at this late stage of brain maturation. Frequency and condition specific EEG-fMRI correlations proved robust for multiple brain regions. However, no consistent change in the EEG-BOLD correlations was identified that would correspond to the neuronal maturation captured by the EEG. This result indicates that the EEG-BOLD correlation measures a distinct aspect of neurophysiological activity that presumably matures earlier, since it is less sensitive to late maturation than the neuronal activity captured by low-frequency EEG.",

    abstract = "Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic and a candidate drug model of psychosis. This study measured the effects of psilocybin on resting-state network and thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy volunteers received intravenous infusions of psilocybin and placebo in 2 task-free resting-state scans. Primary analyses focused on changes in FC between the default-mode- (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN). Spontaneous activity in the DMN is orthogonal to spontaneous activity in the TPN, and it is well known that these networks support very different functions (ie, the DMN supports introspection, whereas the TPN supports externally focused attention). Here, independent components and seed-based FC analyses revealed increased DMN-TPN FC and so decreased DMN-TPN orthogonality after psilocybin. Increased DMN-TPN FC has been found in psychosis and meditatory states, which share some phenomenological similarities with the psychedelic state. Increased DMN-TPN FC has also been observed in sedation, as has decreased thalamocortical FC, but here we found preserved thalamocortical FC after psilocybin. Thus, we propose that thalamocortical FC may be related to arousal, whereas DMN-TPN FC is related to the separateness of internally and externally focused states. We suggest that this orthogonality is compromised in early psychosis, explaining similarities between its phenomenology and that of the psychedelic state and supporting the utility of psilocybin as a model of early psychosis",

Twenty-four medication-free patients with major depression and 29 matched, healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A promising classification accuracy of 90.6\% was achieved using resting-state functional connectivity between predefined cerebellar seed regions and the voxels within the cerebrum as features. Moreover, the most discriminating functional connections were mainly located between the cerebellum and the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the temporal lobe and the fusiform gyrus, which may contribute to the emotional and cognitive impairments observed in major depression.

Projection of individual connectivity matrices into this basis allows for dimensionality reduction, facilitating subsequent statistical analysis. We find dominant components for a collection of connectivity matrices by using the projective non-negative component analysis technique which ensures that the components have non-negative elements and are non-negatively combined to obtain individual subject networks, facilitating interpretation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our novel framework by applying it to simulated connectivity matrices as well as to a clinical study using connectivity matrices derived from resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a population of subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)",

    abstract = "Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging is proving to be an essential tool for the characterization of functional networks in the brain. Two of the major networks that have been identified are the default mode network (DMN) and the task positive network (TPN). Although prior work indicates that these two networks are anti-correlated, the findings are controversial because the anti-correlations are often found only after the application of a pre-processing step, known as global signal regression, that can produce artifactual anti-correlations. In this paper, we show that, for subjects studied in an eyes-closed rest state, caffeine can significantly enhance the detection of anti-correlations between the DMN and TPN without the need for global signal regression. In line with these findings, we find that caffeine also leads to widespread decreases in connectivity and global signal amplitude. Using a recently introduced geometric model of global signal effects, we demonstrate that these decreases are consistent with the removal of an additive global signal confound. In contrast to the effects observed in the eyes-closed rest state, caffeine did not lead to significant changes in global functional connectivity in the eyes-open rest state",

We used high-resolution resting state fMRI and T1 3D data to investigate such asymmetries in two groups of healthy subjects, one right-handed and one left-handed. Independent Component Analysis and the dual regression approach were carried out to identify functional asymmetries, while voxel-based morphometry was used to identify structural asymmetries in grey matter volume within the DMN. Greater leftward functional connectivity was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) for both groups. Leftward functional asymmetry was observed in the thalamus and rightward functional asymmetries were observed in the middle frontal and middle/superior temporal gyrus in the right-handed group. Rightward asymmetries in grey matter volume were observed in the posterior portion of the PCG for both groups. The right-handed group exhibited leftward structural asymmetries in the anterior portion of the PCG and in the middle frontal and posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus, while rightward asymmetries were observed in the posterior portion of the PCG and anterior portions of temporal regions. These results suggest that functional connectivity and grey matter volume are not equally distributed between hemispheres within the DMN, and that functional asymmetries are not always reflected or determined by structural asymmetries",

    abstract = {Disorders of consciousness (DOC) raise profound scientific, clinical, ethical, and philosophical issues. Growing knowledge on fundamental principles of brain organization in healthy individuals offers new opportunities for a better understanding of residual brain function in DOCs. We here discuss new perspectives derived from a recently proposed scheme of brain organization underlying consciousness in healthy individuals. In this scheme, thalamo-cortical networks can be divided into two, often antagonistic, global systems: (i) a system of externally oriented, sensory-motor networks (the "extrinsic" system); and (ii) a system of inward-oriented networks (the "intrinsic" or default system). According to this framework, four distinct mental states would be possible that could be relevant for understanding DOCs. In normal healthy volunteers and locked-in syndrome patients, a state of high functionality of both the extrinsic and intrinsic or default systems is expected--associated with full awareness of environment and self. In this case, mental imagery tasks combined with fMRI can be used to detect covert awareness in patients that are unable to communicate. According to the framework, two complementary states of system imbalance are also possible, in which one system is in a hyperfunctional state, while the other is hypoactive. Extrinsic system hyperfunction is expected to lead to a state of total sensory-motor "absorption" or "lost self." In contrast, intrinsic or default system hyperfunction is expected to lead to a state of complete detachment from the external world. A state where both extrinsic and intrinsic systems are hypofunctional is predicted to lead to markedly impaired consciousness as seen in DOCs. Finally, we review the potential use of ultra-slow fluctuations in BOLD signal as a tool for assessing the functional integrity of extrinsic and intrinsic systems during "resting state" fMRI acquisitions. In particular, we discuss the potential provided by assessment of these slow spontaneous BOLD fluctuations as a novel tool in assessing the cognitive state and chances of recovery from brain pathologies underlying DOCs.},

Hence fMRI has had limited use in clinical management. Alternatively, resting-state fMRI (ie, with no task) can elucidate the brain's functional connections by determining temporal synchrony between brain regions. OBJECTIVE: . The authors examined whether resting-state fMRI can elucidate the disruption of functional connections within hours of ischemic stroke as well as during recovery. METHODS: . A total of 51 ischemic stroke patients-31 with mild-to-moderate hand deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] motor score ≥1) and 20 with NIHSS score of 0-underwent resting-state fMRI at <24 hours, 7 days, and 90 days poststroke; 15 age-matched healthy individuals participated in 1 session. Using the resting-state fMRI signal from the ipsilesional motor cortex, the strength of functional connections with the contralesional motor cortex was computed. Whole-brain maps of the resting-state motor network were also generated and compared between groups and sessions. RESULTS: . Within hours poststroke, patients with motor deficits exhibited significantly lower connectivity than controls (P = .02) and patients with no motor impairment (P = .03). Connectivity was reestablished after 7 days in recovered (ie, NIHSS score = 0) participants. After 90 days, recovered patients exhibited normal motor connectivity; however, reduced connectivity with subcortical regions associated with effort and cognitive processing remained. CONCLUSION: . Resting-state fMRI within hours of ischemic stroke can demonstrate the impact of stroke on functional connections throughout the brain. This tool has the potential to help select appropriate stroke therapies in an acute imaging setting and to monitor the efficacy of rehabilitation",

Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of brain function at resting-state, is used here as a feature of classification. Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) is performed on the features of training samples and a linear classifier is generated. Our initial experimental results show a successful classification rate of 85\%, using leave-one-out cross validation. The classifier is also compared with linear support vector machine (SVM) and Batch Perceptron. Our classifier outperforms the alternatives significantly. Fisher brain, the optimal projective-direction vector in FDA, is used to represent the discriminative pattern. Some abnormal brain regions identified by Fisher brain, like prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are well consistent with that reported in neuroimaging studies on ADHD. Moreover, some less reported but highly discriminative regions are also identified.

The issues on how these hubs interact to each other, with the rest nodes of the DMN and the altered pattern of hubs with respect to AD, are still on going discussion for eventual final clarification.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address these issues, we investigated the causal influences between any pair of nodes within the DMN using Granger causality analysis and graph-theoretic methods on resting-state fMRI data of 12 young subjects, 16 old normal controls and 15 AD patients respectively. We found that: (1) PCC/MPFC/IPC, especially the PCC, showed the widest and distinctive causal effects on the DMN dynamics in young group; (2) the pattern of DMN hubs was abnormal in AD patients compared to old control: MPFC and IPC had obvious causal interaction disruption with other nodes; the PCC showed outstanding performance for it was the only region having causal relation with all other nodes significantly; (3) the altered relation between hubs and other DMN nodes held potential as a noninvasive biomarker of AD.CONCLUSIONS: Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to support the hub configuration of the DMN from the perspective of causal relationship, and reveal abnormal pattern of the DMN hubs in AD. Findings from young subjects provide additional evidence for the role of PCC/MPFC/IPC acting as hubs in the DMN. Compared to old control, MPFC and IPC lost their roles as hubs owing to the obvious causal interaction disruption, and PCC was preserved as the only hub showing significant causal relations with all other nodes.",

However, it has had much less of an impact in clinical neuroscience. While a majority of fMRI applications examine brain function in response to an externally driven task, an alternative approach characterizes the brain's intrinsic functional architecture. This involves fMRI scanning in the absence of an explicit task (i.e., in the resting state) and is, therefore, much more easily performed and tolerated by neurological and neuropsychiatric patient groups. The data are easily acquired, and the functional networks extracted are reproducible and reliable. However, quantifying networks of distributed brain activity and identifying the most informative features in a particular disorder remain a challenge. Progress has been made in this direction in recent years, with the adoption of mathematical tools from communications engineering. Specific alterations to the brain's functional connectivity at rest have been observed in generalized and focal epilepsies, as well as in non-epileptic attack disorder. The challenge for the future is to exploit knowledge of how the brain works as a complex system in order to develop more accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

This method does not require any task performance and measures the spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of the fMRI signal over time. Our objective in the present work is to provide preliminary information on the possible clinical utility of this technique for presurgical planning and on possible future applications.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Data from prior fMRI resting-state studies were reviewed for their potential use in preoperative mapping. Structural and resting-state fMRI data from normal subjects and patients with brain tumors were preprocessed and seed regions were placed in key regions of the brain; the related functional networks were identified using correlation analysis.RESULTS:Several key functional networks can be identified in patients with brain tumors from resting-state fMRI data.CONCLUSION:Resting-state fMRI data can provide valuable presurgical information in many patients who cannot benefit from traditional task-based fMRI.

It has been related to abnormal functional organization of brain networks believed to process homeostatic (internal) and/or salience (external) information. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis to delineate possible functional changes in brain networks related to obesity. A group of 18 healthy adult participants with obesity were compared with a group of 16 lean participants while performing a resting-state task, with the data being evaluated by independent component analysis. Participants also completed a neuropsychological assessment. Results showed that the functional connectivity strength of the putamen nucleus in the salience network was increased in the obese group. We speculate that this abnormal activation may contribute to overeating through an imbalance between autonomic processing and reward processing of food stimuli. A correlation was also observed in obesity between activation of the putamen nucleus in the salience network and mental slowness, which is consistent with the notion that basal ganglia circuits modulate rapid processing of information.

Our goal was to further examine alterations in functional connectivity within and between the default mode network and three cognitive control networks (frontal-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and cerebellar) as a basis for such impairments.METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected from 40 individuals with DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia, 31 siblings of individuals with schizophrenia, 15 healthy control subjects, and 18 siblings of healthy control subjects while they rested quietly with their eyes closed. Connectivity metrics were compared between patients and control subjects for both within- and between-network connections and were used to predict clinical symptoms and cognitive function.RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia showed reduced distal and somewhat enhanced local connectivity between the cognitive control networks compared with control subjects. Additionally, greater connectivity between the frontal-parietal and cerebellar regions was robustly predictive of better cognitive performance across groups and predictive of fewer disorganization symptoms among patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that impairments of executive function and cognitive control result from disruption in the coordination of activity across brain networks and additionally suggest that these might reflect impairments in normal pattern of brain connectivity development.",

No special "resting-state networks" were identified. There were four major features in the resulting tree (dendrogram). First, there was a strong clustering of homotopic, left-right hemispheric areas. Second, cortical areas were concatenated in multiple, partially overlapping clusters. Third, the arrangement of the areas revealed a layout that closely resembled the actual layout of the cerebral cortex, namely an orderly progression from anterior to posterior. And fourth, the layout of the cortical areas in the tree conformed to principles of efficient, compact layout of components proposed by Cherniak. Since the tree was derived on the basis of the strength of neural correlations, these results document an orderly relation between functional interactions and layout, i.e., between structure and function},

However, very little progress has been made in elucidating the nature of BOLD contrast during the resting or baseline state of the brain, which is important for understanding normal human performance because it accounts for most of the enormous energy budget of the brain. It is also crucial for deciphering the consequences of baseline-state impairment by cerebral vascular diseases. The objective of this study was to develop a BOLD MR-based method that allows quantitative evaluation of tissue hemodynamic parameters, such as the blood volume, deoxyhemoglobin concentration, and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). The proposed method, which we have termed quantitative BOLD (qBOLD), is based on an MR signal model that incorporates prior knowledge about brain tissue composition and considers signals from gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood. A 2D gradient-echo sampling of spin-echo (GESSE) pulse sequence is used for the acquisition of the MRI signal. The method is applied to estimate the hemodynamic parameters of the normal human brain in the baseline state.",

Recording blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal using functional magnetic resonance imaging and skin conductance simultaneously during rest in human subjects, we found that the spontaneous fluctuations of BOLD signals in key nodes of RSNs are associated with changes in nonspecific skin conductance response, a sensitive psychophysiological index of autonomic arousal.

    abstract = "Several studies posit energy as a constraint on the coding and processing of information in the brain due to the high cost of resting and evoked cortical activity. This suggestion has been addressed theoretically with models of a single neuron and two coupled neurons. Neural mass models (NMMs) address mean-field based modeling of the activity and interactions between populations of neurons rather than a few neurons. NMMs have been widely employed for studying the generation of EEG rhythms, and more recently as frameworks for integrated models of neurophysiology and functional MRI (fMRI) responses. To date, the consequences of energy constraints on the activity and interactions of ensembles of neurons have not been addressed. Here we aim to study the impact of constraining energy consumption during the resting-state on NMM parameters. To this end, we first linearized the model, then used stochastic control theory by introducing a quadratic cost function, which transforms the NMM into a stochastic linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Solving the LQR problem introduces a regime in which the NMM parameters, specifically the effective connectivities between neuronal populations, must vary with time. This is in contrast to current NMMs, which assume a constant parameter set for a given condition or task. We further simulated energy-constrained stochastic control of a specific NMM, the Wilson and Cowan model of two coupled neuronal populations, one of which is excitatory and the other inhibitory. These simulations demonstrate that with varying weights of the energy-cost function, the NMM parameters show different time-varying behavior. We conclude that constraining NMMs according to energy consumption may create more realistic models. We further propose to employ linear NMMs with time-varying parameters as an alternative to traditional nonlinear NMMs with constant parameters",

However, valid statistical analysis used to identify such networks must address sources of noise in order to avoid possible confounds such as spurious correlations based on non-neuronal sources. We have developed a functional connectivity toolbox Conn ( www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ) that implements the component-based noise correction method (CompCor) strategy for physiological and other noise source reduction, additional removal of movement, and temporal covariates, temporal filtering and windowing of the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast signal, first-level estimation of multiple standard functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) measures, and second-level random-effect analysis for resting state as well as task-related data. Compared to methods that rely on global signal regression, the CompCor noise reduction method allows for interpretation of anticorrelations as there is no regression of the global signal. The toolbox implements fcMRI measures, such as estimation of seed-to-voxel and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional correlations, as well as semipartial correlation and bivariate/multivariate regression analysis for multiple ROI sources, graph theoretical analysis, and novel voxel-to-voxel analysis of functional connectivity. We describe the methods implemented in the Conn toolbox for the analysis of fcMRI data, together with examples of use and interscan reliability estimates of all the implemented fcMRI measures. The results indicate that the CompCor method increases the sensitivity and selectivity of fcMRI analysis, and show a high degree of interscan reliability for many fcMRI measures",

This pilot study asked whether efficacy of robot-aided motor rehabilitation in chronic stroke could be predicted by a change in functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network in response to a bout of motor rehabilitation. To address this question, two stroke patients participated in a functional connectivity MRI study pre and post a 12-week robot-aided motor rehabilitation program. Functional connectivity was evaluated during three consecutive scans before the rehabilitation program: resting-state; point-to-point reaching movements executed by the paretic upper extremity (UE) using a newly developed MRI-compatible sensorized passive manipulandum; resting-state. A single resting-state scan was conducted after the rehabilitation program. Before the program, UE movement reduced functional connectivity between the ipsilesional and contralesional primary motor cortex. Reduced interhemispheric functional connectivity persisted during the second resting-state scan relative to the first and during the resting-state scan after the rehabilitation program. Greater reduction in interhemispheric functional connectivity during the resting-state was associated with greater gains in UE motor function induced by the 12-week robotic therapy program. These findings suggest that greater reduction in interhemispheric functional connectivity in response to a bout of motor rehabilitation may predict greater efficacy of the full rehabilitation program",

We note several limitations of traditional approaches to describing brain networks and describe a powerful framework for analyzing networks, called graph theory. We argue that characterization of the development of brain systems (e.g., the default mode network) should be comprehensive, considering not only relationships within a given system, but also how these relationships are situated within wider network contexts. We note that, despite substantial reorganization of functional connectivity, several large-scale network properties appear to be preserved across development, suggesting that functional brain networks, even in children, are organized in manners similar to other complex systems",

Zen meditation, in particular, is traditionally associated with a mental state of full awareness but reduced conceptual content, to be attained via a disciplined regulation of attention and bodily posture. Using fMRI and a simplified meditative condition interspersed with a lexical decision task, we investigated the neural correlates of conceptual processing during meditation in regular Zen practitioners and matched control subjects. While behavioral performance did not differ between groups, Zen practitioners displayed a reduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual processing in regions of the default network, suggesting that meditative training may foster the ability to control the automatic cascade of semantic associations triggered by a stimulus and, by extension, to voluntarily regulate the flow of spontaneous mentation.},

After extraction of regional fMRI time series from 110 cortical and subcortical regions, we applied a maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation and investigated changes in the brain's intrinsic spatiotemporal organization. During PI-LOC, we observed a breakdown of subcortico-cortical and corticocortical connectivity. Decrease of connectivity was pronounced in thalamocortical connections, whereas no changes were found for connectivity within primary sensory cortices. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant changes in the degree distribution and local organization metrics of brain functional networks during PI-LOC: compared with a random network, normalized clustering was significantly increased, as was small-worldness. Furthermore we observed a profound decline in long-range connections and a reduction in whole-brain spatiotemporal integration, supporting a topological reconfiguration during PI-LOC.

However, such S(0) and T(2)(*) features have not been well characterized. In this study, spatial and spectral characteristics of functional connectivity on sensorimotor, default-mode, dorsal attention, and primary visual systems were examined using a multiple gradient-echo sequence at 3T. In the spatial domain, we found broad, local correlations at short echo times (TE ≤ 14 ms) due to dominant S(0) contribution, whereas long-range connections mediated by T(2)(*) became explicit at TEs longer than 22 ms. In the frequency domain, compared with the flat spectrum of S(0), spectral power of the T(2)(*)-weighted signal elevated significantly with increasing TE, particularly in the frequency ranges of 0.008-0.023 Hz and 0.037-0.043 Hz. Using the S(0) spectrum as a reference, we propose two indices to measure spectral signal change (SSC) and spectral contrast-to-noise ratio (SCNR), respectively, for quantifying the RS-fMRI signal. These indices demonstrated TE dependency of connectivity-related fluctuation strength, resembling functional contrasts in activation-based fMRI. These findings further confirm that large-scale functional circuit connectivity based on BOLD contrast may be constrained within specific frequency ranges in every brain network, and the spectral features of S(0) and T(2)(*) could be valuable for interpreting and quantifying RS-fMRI data",

One account of these phenomena postulates processes ongoing during conscious, resting states that are interrupted or inhibited by task performance. Psychological evidence suggests that conscious humans are engaged almost continuously in adaptive processes involving semantic knowledge retrieval, representation in awareness, and directed manipulation of represented knowledge for organization, problem-solving, and planning. If interruption of such 'conceptual' processes accounts for task-induced deactivation, tasks that also engage these conceptual processes should not cause deactivation. Furthermore, comparisons between conceptual and nonconceptual tasks should show activation during conceptual tasks of the same brain areas that are 'deactivated' relative to rest. To test this model, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during a resting state, a perceptual task, and a semantic retrieval task. A network of left-hemisphere polymodal cortical regions showed higher signal values during the resting state than during the perceptual task but equal values during the resting and semantic conditions. This result is consistent with the proposal that perceptual tasks interrupt processes ongoing during rest that involve many of the same brain areas engaged during semantic retrieval. As further evidence for this model, the same network of brain areas was activated in two direct comparisons between semantic and perceptual processing tasks. This same 'conceptual processing' network was also identified in several previous studies that contrasted semantic and perceptual tasks or resting and active states. The model proposed here offers a unified account of these findings and may help to explain several unanticipated results from prior studies of semantic processing.",

    abstract = "The act of opening (or closing) one's eyes has long been demonstrated to impact on brain function. However, the eyes open condition is usually accompanied by visual input, and this effect may have been a significant confounding factor in previous studies. To clarify this situation, we extended the traditional eyes open/closed study to a two-factor balanced, repeated measures resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) experiment, in which light on/off was also included as a factor. In 16 healthy participants, we estimated the univariate properties of the BOLD signal, as well as a bivariate measure of functional connectivity and multivariate network topology measures. Across all these measures, we demonstrate that human brain adopts a distinctive configuration when eyes are open (compared to when eyes are closed) independently of exogenous light input: (i) the eyes open state was associated with decreased BOLD signal variance (P-value=0.0004), decreased fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF. P-value=0.0061), and decreased Hurst exponent (H. P-value=0.0321) mainly in the primary and secondary sensory cortical areas, the insula, and the thalamus. (ii) The strength of functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a major component of the default mode network (DMN), and the bilateral perisylvian and perirolandic regions was also significantly decreased during eyes open states. (iii) On the other hand, the average network connection distance increased during eyes open states (P-value=0.0139). Additionally, the metrics of univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses in this study are significantly correlated. In short, we have shown that the marked effects on the dynamics and connectivity of fMRI time series brought by volitional eyes open or closed are simply endogenous and irrespective of exogenous visual stimulus. The state of eyes open (or closed) may thus be an important factor to control in design of rs-fMRI and even other cognitive block or event-related experiments",

    abstract = "The blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are contaminated with noise from various physiological processes, such as spontaneous low-frequency oscillations (LFOs), respiration, and cardiac pulsation. These processes are coupled to the BOLD signal by different mechanisms, and represent variations with very different frequency content; however, because of the low sampling rate of fMRI, these signals are generally not separable by frequency, as the cardiac and respiratory waveforms alias into the LFO band. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of the individual noise processes by conducting concurrent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and fMRI studies on six subjects during a resting state acquisition. Three time series corresponding to LFO, respiration, and cardiac pulsation were extracted by frequency from the NIRS signal (which has sufficient temporal resolution to critically sample the cardiac waveform) and used as regressors in a BOLD fMRI analysis. Our results suggest that LFO and cardiac signals modulate the BOLD signal independently through the circulatory system. The spatiotemporal evolution of the LFO signal in the BOLD data correlates with the global cerebral blood flow. Near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to partition these contributing factors and independently determine their contribution to the BOLD signal.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow \& Metabolism advance online publication, 3 August 2011; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2011.100.",

Presenting meta-analytic evidence, we show that the anterior paralimbic, e.g. midline, regions do indeed seem to be specific for self-specific stimuli. We conclude that future investigation of the self need to develop novel concepts that are more empirically plausible than those currently in use. Different concepts of self will require novel experimental designs that include, for example, the brain's resting state activity as an independent variable. Modifications of both conceptual and anatomical dimensions will allow an empirically more plausible account of the relationship between brain and self.",

Initial studies of resting state network mapping have focused primarily on major networks such as the default mode network, primary motor, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. However more specific or sub-networks including those associated with specific motor functions have yet to be properly addressed. We performed independent component analysis (ICA) in a specific target region of the brain, a process we name "localized ICA". We demonstrated that ICA with localized data can, resting state LFFS in regions associated with specific motor functions (e.g. finger tapping, foot movement, or bilateral lip pulsing) and other smaller networks can be distinguished from one another. These ICA components generated from localized data can then be used as functional regions of interest (ROIs) to map whole brain connectivity. In addition, this method can be used to visualize interregional connectivity by expanding the localized region and identifying components which show connectivity between the two regions},

The heterogeneity in the severity of these characteristics across individuals with ASD has led some researchers to suggest that these disorders form a continuum which extends into the general, or "typical," population, and there is growing evidence that the extent to which typical adults display autistic traits, as measured using the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ), predicts performance on behavioral tasks that are impaired in ASD. Here, we show that variation in autism spectrum traits is related to cortical structure and function within the typical population. Voxel-based morphometry showed that increased AQ scores were associated with decreased white matter volume in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a region important in processing socially relevant stimuli and associated with structural and functional impairments in ASD. In addition, AQ was correlated with the extent of cortical deactivation of an adjacent area of pSTS during a Stroop task relative to rest, reflecting variation in resting state function. The results provide evidence that autism spectrum characteristics are reflected in neural structure and function across the typical (non-ASD) population.},

In our work, we focused on this network and investigated the intrinsic properties of low frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFFs) during changes of visual stimuli. There were two main questions to be discussed in this study: intrinsic properties of LFFs regarding (1) interactions between visual stimuli and resting-state; (2) impact of repetition rate of visual stimuli.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed scanning sessions that contained rest and visual stimuli in various repetition rates with a novel method. The method included three numerical approaches involving ICA (Independent Component Analyses), fALFF (fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuation), and Coherence, to respectively investigate the modulations of visual network pattern, low frequency fluctuation power, and interregional functional connectivity during changes of visual stimuli. We discovered when resting-state was replaced by visual stimuli, more areas were involved in visual processing, and both stronger low frequency fluctuations and higher interregional functional connectivity occurred in visual network. With changes of visual repetition rate, the number of areas which were involved in visual processing, low frequency fluctuation power, and interregional functional connectivity in this network were also modulated.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To combine the results of prior literatures and our discoveries, intrinsic properties of LFFs in visual network are altered not only by modulations of endogenous factors (eye-open or eye-closed condition; alcohol administration) and disordered behaviors (early blind), but also exogenous sensory stimuli (visual stimuli with various repetition rates). It demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of LFFs are valuable to represent physiological states of human brains",

Human studies, which have focused primarily on patients with clinically established posttraumatic stress disorders, have reported abnormalities in similar brain structures. At present, little is known about potential alterations of brain function in trauma survivors shortly after traumatic events. Here, we show alteration of brain function in a cohort of healthy survivors within 25 days after the Wenchuan earthquake by a recently discovered method known as "resting-state" functional MRI. The current investigation demonstrates that regional activity in frontolimbic and striatal areas increased significantly and connectivity among limbic and striatal networks was attenuated in our participants who had recently experienced severe emotional trauma. Trauma victims also had a reduced temporal synchronization within the "default mode" of resting-state brain function, which has been characterized in humans and other species. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that significant alterations in brain function, similar in many ways to those observed in posttraumatic stress disorders, can be seen shortly after major traumatic experiences, highlighting the need for early evaluation and intervention for trauma survivors.},

With the inability of traditional brain imaging techniques to properly assess the severity of brain damage induced by a concussive blow, there is hope that more advanced applications such as resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsFMRI) will be more specific in accurately diagnosing mTBI. In this rsFMRI study, we examined 17 subjects 10±2 days post-sports-related mTBI and 17 age-matched normal volunteers (NVs) to investigate the possibility that the integrity of the resting state brain network is disrupted following a single concussive blow. We hypothesized that advanced brain imaging techniques may reveal subtle alterations of functional brain connections in asymptomatic mTBI subjects. There are several findings of interest. All mTBI subjects were asymptomatic based upon clinical evaluation and neuropsychological (NP) assessments prior to the MRI session. The mTBI subjects revealed a disrupted functional network both at rest and in response to the YMCA physical stress test. Specifically, interhemispheric connectivity was significantly reduced in the primary visual cortex, hippocampal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex networks (p<0.05). The YMCA physical stress induced nonspecific and similar changes in brain network connectivity patterns in both the mTBI and NV groups. These major findings are discussed in relation to underlying mechanisms, clinical assessment of mTBI, and current debate regarding functional brain connectivity in a clinical population. Overall, our major findings clearly indicate that functional brain alterations in the acute phase of injury are overlooked when conventional clinical and neuropsychological examinations are used.",

In this context, a detailed understanding of brain networks regulating food intake, including hormonal modulation, is crucial. At present, little is known about potential alterations of cerebral networks regulating ingestive behavior. We used "resting state" functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the functional connectivity integrity of resting state networks (RSNs) related to food intake in lean and obese subjects using independent component analysis. Our results showed altered functional connectivity strength in obese compared to lean subjects in the default mode network (DMN) and temporal lobe network. In the DMN, obese subjects showed in the precuneus bilaterally increased and in the right anterior cingulate decreased functional connectivity strength. Furthermore, in the temporal lobe network, obese subjects showed decreased functional connectivity strength in the left insular cortex. The functional connectivity magnitude significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI). Two further RSNs, including brain regions associated with food and reward processing, did not show BMI, but insulin associated functional connectivity strength. Here, the left orbitofrontal cortex and right putamen functional connectivity strength was positively correlated with fasting insulin levels and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity index. Taken together, these results complement and expand previous functional neuroimaging findings by demonstrating that obesity and insulin levels influence brain function during rest in networks supporting reward and food regulation.

    abstract = "In the alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rat during single forepaw stimulation, a spatially localized 1H[13C] nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic method was used to measure the rate of cerebral [C4]-glutamate isotopic turnover from infused [1,6-(13)C]glucose. The glutamate turnover data were analyzed using a mathematical model of cerebral glucose metabolism to evaluate the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux (V(TCA)). During stimulation the value of V(TCA) in the sensorimotor region increased from 0.47 +/- 0.06 (at rest) to 1.44 +/- 0.41 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.01) in the contralateral hemispheric compartment (24 mm3) and to 0.65 +/- 0.10 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.03) in the ipsilateral side. Each V(TCA) value was converted to the cerebral metabolic rates of glucose oxidation (oxidative-CMR(glc)) and oxygen consumption (CMR(O2)). These rates were corrected for partial-volume based on activation maps obtained by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The percent increase and the absolute value of oxidative-CMR(glc) in the activated regions are similar to values reported previously for total-CMR(glc) using the same activation paradigm. This indicates that the large majority of energy required for brain activation, in going from the resting to an activated state, is supplied by glucose oxidation. The level of activity during stimulation is relevant to awake animals because the oxidative-CMR(glc) (1.05 +/- 0.28 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1); current study) is in the range of total-CMR(glc) previously reported for awake rats undergoing physiologic activation (0.7-1.4 micromol x g(-1) x min(-1)). It is concluded that oxidative glycolysis is the main source of energy for increased brain activity and a positive BOLD fMRI signal-change occurs in conjunction with a large increase in CMR(O2).",

While its acute effects on brain and behaviour have been studied, the effects of long-term exposure to ketamine on brain activity have been largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to examine such effects on spontaneous brain dynamics measure using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Forty-one patients with ketamine dependence and forty-four healthy control subjects were imaged with BOLD fMRI using a 3.0-Tesla Siemens scanner at the Magnetic Resonance Center of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, analyzed with the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method. Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo was found in ketamine users in the right anterior cingulate cortex and increased ReHo was found in left precentral frontal gyrus (p<0.05, cluster-level corrected). We also observed negative correlations between increased ReHo in precentral frontal gyrus and estimated total lifetime ketamine consumption and ketamine craving levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study the long-term effects of ketamine exposure on brain functional activity. Our findings indicate that ketamine dependence is associated with alterations in the functional connectivity of medial and lateral prefrontal cortices",

    abstract = "There is still no clear consensus as to which of the many functional and structural changes in the brain in schizophrenia are of most importance, although the main focus to date has been on those in the frontal and cingulate cortices. In the present study, we have used a novel holistic approach to identify brain-wide functional connectivity changes in medicated schizophrenia patients, and functional connectivity changes were analyzed using resting-state fMRI data from 69 medicated schizophrenia patients and 62 healthy controls. As far as we are aware, this is the largest population reported in the literature for a resting-state study. Voxel-based morphometry was also used to investigate gray and white matter volume changes. Changes were correlated with illness duration/symptom severity and a support vector machine analysis assessed predictive validity. A network involving the inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal gyrus, precuneus, superior marginal, and angular gyri was by far the most affected (68\% predictive validity compared with 82\% using all connections) and different components correlated with illness duration and positive and negative symptom severity. Smaller changes occurred in emotional memory and sensory and motor processing networks along with weakened interhemispheric connections. Our findings identify the key functional circuitry altered in schizophrenia involving the default network midline cortical system and the cortical mirror neuron system, both playing important roles in sensory and cognitive processing and particularly self-processing, all of which are affected in this disorder. Interestingly, the functional connectivity changes with the strongest links to schizophrenia involved parietal rather than frontal regions. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

Under this framework, we aimed to investigate the functional specialization of the human cingulate cortex by analyzing the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of each subregion from a network perspective. In 20 healthy subjects we systematically investigated the FC patterns of the bilateral subgenual (sACC) and pregenual (pACC) anterior cingulate cortices, anterior (aMCC) and posterior (pMCC) midcingulate cortices, dorsal (dPCC) and ventral (vPCC) posterior cingulate cortices and retrosplenial cortices (RSC). We found that each cingulate subregion was specifically integrated in the predescribed functional networks and showed anti-correlated resting-state fluctuations. The sACC and pACC were involved in an affective network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor and cognitive networks, while the pACC also correlated with the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the visual network. In the midcingulate cortex, however, the aMCC was correlated with the cognitive and sensorimotor networks and anti-correlated with the visual, affective and default-mode networks, whereas the pMCC only correlated with the sensorimotor network and anti-correlated with the cognitive and visual networks. The dPCC and vPCC involved in the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor, cognitive and visual networks, in contrast, the RSC was mainly correlated with the PCC and thalamus. Based on a strong hypothesis driven approach of anatomical partitions of the cingulate cortex, we could confirm their segregation in terms of functional neuroanatomy, as suggested earlier by task studies or exploratory multi-seed investigations.",

These functional networks included motor sensory, default-mode, extrastriate visual, temporal visual association, and salience networks. We found an extensive modulation elicited by food stimuli in the 2 visual and salience networks, with a dissociable pattern in the time course and functional connectivity between lean and overweight/obese subjects. Specifically, only in lean subjects, the temporal visual association network was modulated by the stimulus category and the salience network by caloric content, whereas overweight and obese subjects showed a generalized augmented response in the salience network. Furthermore, overweight/obese subjects showed changes in functional connectivity in networks important for object recognition, motivational salience, and executive control. These alterations could potentially lead to top-down deficiencies driving the overconsumption of food in the obese population",

Recently, resting state networks (RSNs), representing brain regions of coherent BOLD fluctuations, raised major interest in the neuroscience community. Since RSNs are reliably found across subjects and reflect task related networks, changes in their characteristics might give insight to neuronal changes or damage, promising a broad range of scientific and clinical applications. The question of how RSNs are linked to electrophysiological signal characteristics becomes relevant in this context. In this combined EEG-fMRI study we investigated the relationship of RSNs and their correlated electrophysiological signals [electrophysiological correlation patterns (ECPs)] using a long (34 min) resting state scan per subject. This allowed us to study ECPs on group as well as on single subject level, and to examine the temporal stability of ECPs within each subject. We found that the correlation patterns obtained on group level show a large inter-subject variability. During the long scan the ECPs within a subject show temporal fluctuations, which we interpret as a result of the complex temporal dynamic of the RSNs",

We aimed to investigate if non-demented older individuals with increased amyloid burden demonstrate disruptions of functional whole-brain connectivity in cortical hubs (brain regions typically highly connected to multiple other brain areas) and if these disruptions are associated with neuronal dysfunction as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. In healthy subjects without cognitive symptoms and patients with mild cognitive impairment, we used positron emission tomography to assess amyloid burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, structural magnetic resonance imaging to quantify atrophy and novel resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging processing methods to calculate whole-brain connectivity. Significant disruptions of whole-brain connectivity were found in amyloid-positive patients with mild cognitive impairment in typical cortical hubs (posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus), strongly overlapping with regional hypometabolism. Subtle connectivity disruptions and hypometabolism were already present in amyloid-positive asymptomatic subjects. Voxel-based morphometry measures indicate that these findings were not solely a consequence of regional atrophy. Whole-brain connectivity values and metabolism showed a positive correlation with each other and a negative correlation with amyloid burden. These results indicate that disruption of functional connectivity and hypometabolism may represent early functional consequences of emerging molecular Alzheimer's disease pathology, evolving prior to clinical onset of dementia. The spatial overlap between hypometabolism and disruption of connectivity in cortical hubs points to a particular susceptibility of these regions to early Alzheimer's-type neurodegeneration and may reflect a link between synaptic dysfunction and functional disconnection.",

Standard word-by-word presentation is often used although exposure to a new language normally occurs in a natural, real world situation. In the current experiment we investigated naturalistic language exposure and applied a model-free analysis for hemodynamic-response data. Functional connectivity, temporal correlations between hemodynamic activity of different areas, was assessed during rest before and after presentation of a movie of a weather report in Mandarin Chinese to Dutch participants. We hypothesized that learning of novel words might be associated with stronger functional connectivity of regions that are involved in phonological processing. Participants were divided into two groups, learners and non-learners, based on the scores on a post hoc word recognition task. The learners were able to recognize Chinese target words from the weather report, while the non-learners were not. In the first resting state period, before presentation of the movie, stronger functional connectivity was observed for the learners compared to the non-learners between the left supplementary motor area and the left precentral gyrus as well as the left insula and the left rolandic operculum, regions that are important for phonological rehearsal. After exposure to the weather report, functional connectivity between the left and right supramarginal gyrus was stronger for learners than for non-learners. This is consistent with a role of the left supramarginal gyrus in the storage of phonological forms. These results suggest both pre-existing and learning-induced differences between the two groups.",

Here, we quantify the test-retest reliability, using resting scans from 26 participants at 3 different time points. Specifically, we assessed intersession (>5 months apart), intrasession (<1 h apart), and multiscan (across all 3 scans) reliability and consistency for both region-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses. For both approaches, we observed modest to high reliability across connections, dependent upon 3 predictive factors: 1) correlation significance (significantly nonzero > nonsignificant), 2) correlation valence (positive > negative), and 3) network membership (default mode > task positive network). Short- and long-term measures of the consistency of global connectivity patterns were highly robust. Finally, hierarchical clustering solutions were highly reproducible, both across participants and sessions. Our findings provide a solid foundation for continued examination of resting state fcMRI in typical and atypical populations},

Although the PCC often shows consistent deactivation when attention is focused on external events, anatomical studies show that the region is not homogeneous, and electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates suggest that it is directly involved in some forms of attention. We report a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of an attentionally demanding task (either a zero- or two-back working memory task). Standard subtraction analysis within the PCC shows a relative deactivation as task difficulty increases. In contrast, a dual-regression functional connectivity analysis reveals a clear dissociation between ventral and dorsal parts of the PCC. As task difficulty increases, the ventral PCC shows reduced integration within the DMN and less anticorrelation with the cognitive control network (CCN) activated by the task. The dorsal PCC shows an opposite pattern, with increased DMN integration and more anticorrelation. At rest, the dorsal PCC also shows functional connectivity with both the DMN and attentional networks. As expected, these results provide evidence that the PCC is involved in supporting internally directed thought, as the region is more highly integrated with the DMN at low task demands. In contrast, the task-dependent increases in connectivity between the dorsal PCC and the CCN are consistent with a role for this region in modulating the dynamic interaction between these two networks controlling the efficient allocation of attention",

    abstract = {Increased intraindividual variability (IIV) is a hallmark of disorders of attention. Recent work has linked these disorders to abnormalities in a "default mode" network, comprising brain regions routinely deactivated during goal-directed cognitive tasks. Findings from a study of the neural basis of attentional lapses suggest that a competitive relationship between the "task-negative" default mode network and regions of a "task-positive" attentional network is a potential locus of dysfunction in individuals with increased IIV. Resting state studies have shown that this competitive relationship is intrinsically represented in the brain, in the form of a negative correlation or antiphase relationship between spontaneous activity occurring in the two networks. We quantified the negative correlation between these two networks in 26 subjects, during active (Eriksen flanker task) and resting state scans. We hypothesized that the strength of the negative correlation is an index of the degree of regulation of activity in the default mode and task-positive networks and would be positively related to consistent behavioral performance. We found that the strength of the correlation between the two networks varies across individuals. These individual differences appear to be behaviorally relevant, as interindividual variation in the strength of the correlation was significantly related to individual differences in response time variability: the stronger the negative correlation (i.e., the closer to 180 degrees antiphase), the less variable the behavioral performance. This relationship was moderately consistent across resting and task conditions, suggesting that the measure indexes moderately stable individual differences in the integrity of functional brain networks. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the behavioral significance of spontaneous brain activity, in both healthy and clinical populations},

Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 20 non-medicated patients with OCD and 23 matched healthy volunteers. Voxelwise statistical parametric maps testing strength of functional connectivity of three striatal seed regions of interest (ROIs) with remaining brain regions were calculated and compared between groups. We performed additional correlation analyses between strength of connectivity and the severity scores for obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, and anxiety in the OCD group. Positive functional connectivity with the ventral striatum was significantly increased (P(corrected) < .05) in the orbitofrontal cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex of subjects with OCD. There was no significant correlation between measures of symptom severity and the strength of connectivity (P(uncorrected) < .001). This is the first study to investigate the corticostriatal connectivity in non-medicated patients with OCD. These findings provide the first direct evidence supporting a pathophysiological model involving basal ganglia circuitry in OCD",

Most studies have examined associations between a few well-characterised candidate polymorphisms and task-related brain activation differences in individual regions of interest.

All subjects were measured by neuropsychological tests.RESULTS:Decreased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in remitted geriatric depression distributed over the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. In addition, increased ReHo were found mainly in the putamen, frontal and parietal lobes. The RGD patients performed significantly worse in the delayed recall of Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and Trail Making Test A and B (seconds) when compared with the control group. And there are significant negative correlations between ReHo values of right putamen, left superior frontal gyrus and Trail Making Test A (seconds) (r=-0.583, P=0.023; r=-0.598, P=0.018, respectively), Trail Making Test B (seconds) (r=-0.587, P=0.021; r=-0.545, P=0.036, respectively) in the patients with RGD.LIMITATIONS:This study is cross-sectional, therefore it cannot determine whether abnormal brain activation is a state marker or trait marker of RGD in resting-state fMRI.CONCLUSION:Our study reveals that RGD is associated with abnormal activity of certain brain regions, which are believed to be involved in the psychopathology and pathophysiology of executive function in remitted geriatric depression.",

    abstract = "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability and activity in a polarity-dependent way. Stimulation for a few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be related to stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function by functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis of the BOLD fMRI spontaneous activity. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10-min bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. For each dataset, grey matter voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal connectivity degree and minimum path length maps were calculated and compared before and after tDCS. Nodal minimum path lengths significantly increased in the left somatomotor (SM1) cortex after anodal tDCS, which means that the number of direct functional connections from the left SM1 to topologically distant grey matter voxels significantly decreased. In contrast, functional coupling between premotor and superior parietal areas with the left SM1 significantly increased. Additionally, the nodal connectivity degree in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) area as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right DLPFC) significantly increased. In summary, we provide initial support that tDCS-induced neuroplastic alterations might be related to functional connectivity changes in the human brain. Additionally, we propose our approach as a powerful method to track for neuroplastic changes in the human brain.",

Moreover, advanced mathematical methods and theories have arrived the field of fMRI (e.g. computational neuroimaging), and functional and structural brain connectivity can now be assessed non-invasively. RESULTS : The present work deals with a pluralistic approach to "consciousness'', where we connect theory and tools from three quite different disciplines: (1) philosophy of mind (emergentism and global workspace theory), (2) functional neuroimaging acquisitions, and (3) theory of deterministic and statistical neurodynamics - in particular the Wilson-Cowan model and stochastic resonance. CONCLUSIONS : Based on recent experimental and theoretical work, we believe that the study of large-scale neuronal processes (activity fluctuations, state transitions) that goes on in the living human brain while examined with functional MRI during "resting state", can deepen our understanding of graded consciousness in a clinical setting, and clarify the concept of "consiousness" in neurocognitive and neurophilosophy research.},

Here, we sought to determine if pathological effects of Abeta amyloid plaques could be seen, even in the absence of a task, by examining functional connectivity in cognitively normal participants with and without preclinical amyloid deposition. METHODS: Participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 35) were compared with 68 cognitively normal participants who were further subdivided by positron emission tomography (PET) Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB) imaging into those without evidence of brain amyloid (PIB-) and those with brain amyloid (PIB+) deposition. RESULTS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) demonstrated that, compared with the PIB- group, the PIB+ group differed significantly in functional connectivity of the precuneus to hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate, dorsal cingulate, gyrus rectus, superior precuneus, and visual cortex. These differences were in the same regions and in the same direction as differences found in the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, before any manifestations of cognitive or behavioral changes, there were differences in resting state connectivity in cognitively normal subjects with brain amyloid deposition, suggesting that early manifestation of Abeta toxicity can be detected using resting state fMRI.",

Women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer often report problems with memory, concentration, and other cognitive abilities that can pose significant barriers to full resumption of family, job, and social roles. Despite considerable neuropsychological research, many unanswered questions remain about cancer-related cognitive deficits and the underlying neural bases. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures brain activation associated with different mental states and has significantly advanced our understanding of cognitive function and dysfunction in healthy and clinical populations. However, to date the application of fMRI to the study of cognitive function in breast cancer is limited. The current review addresses the potential importance of this method for understanding the neurocognitive effects of breast cancer disease and treatment. Along with reviewing published fMRI studies on breast cancer to date, we discuss potential major contributions of this method which include: (a) delineating components of cognitive function and underlying neural processes most affected by cancer and its treatment, (b) uncovering compensatory processes and their limits, (c) identifying altered resting state networks that may relate to subjective complaints and longer term outcomes, and (d) clarifying the relationship between pre-treatment alterations in brain activity and longer term neural and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we pose questions for future research that can be optimally addressed by integrating fMRI and other imaging modalities to clarify the nature and causes of "chemo brain" and guide interventions to improve cognitive function and the quality of breast cancer survivorship},

Thirty-one HDIs receiving methadone-maintained treatment and 24 control subjects participated. Resting-state functional MR imaging was performed by using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. Regional homogeneity was calculated by using software. Voxel-based analysis of the regional homogeneity maps between control and HDI groups was performed with two-sample t tests by using software. Statistical maps were set at P less than .05 and were corrected for multiple comparisons. The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was used to assess participant decision making during uncertainty. Abnormal clusters revealed by group comparison were extracted and correlated with behavioral performance at the IGT and with duration of heroin use.Results:Regional homogeneity was diminished in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), bilateral dorsal medial thalamus, bilateral cuneus, and lingual gyrus in HDIs compared with control subjects. There were negative correlations between mean regional homogeneity in the medial OFC, bilateral cuneus, and lingual gyrus and duration of heroin use. There was a positive correlation between mean regional homogeneity in the medial OFC and performance level at the IGT.Conclusion:The present study reveals resting-state abnormalities in HDIs that may lead to further improvement of the understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive impairment in HDIs.© RSNA, 2011.",

MATERIALS \#ENTITYSTARTX00026;METHODS: Ten healthy male participants were required to listen to white noise stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to generate individual and group brain activation maps. For input region determination, two intrinsic connectivity models comprising bilateral HG and STG were constructed using dynamic causal modelling (DCM). The models were estimated and inferred using DCM while Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) for group studies was used for model comparison and selection. Based on the winning model, six linear and six non-linear causal models were derived and were again estimated, inferred, and compared to obtain a model that best represents the effective connectivity between HG and the STG, balancing accuracy and complexity.RESULTS: Group results indicated significant asymmetrical activation (p(uncorr) < 0.001) in bilateral HG and STG. Model comparison results showed strong evidence of STG as the input centre. The winning model is preferred by 6 out of 10 participants. The results were supported by BMS results for group studies with the expected posterior probability, r = 0.7830 and exceedance probability, ϕ = 0.9823. One-sample t-tests performed on connection values obtained from the winning model indicated that the valid connections for the winning model are the unidirectional parallel connections from STG to bilateral HG (p < 0.05). Subsequent model comparison between linear and non-linear models using BMS prefers non-linear connection (r = 0.9160, ϕ = 1.000) from which the connectivity between STG and the ipsi- and contralateral HG is gated by the activity in STG itself.CONCLUSION: We are able to demonstrate that the effective connectivity between HG and STG while listening to white noise for the respective participants can be explained by a non-linear dynamic causal model with the activity in STG influencing the STG-HG connectivity non-linearly",

    abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) resemble epileptic seizures, but lack epileptiform brain activity. Instead, the cause is assumed to be psychogenic. An abnormal coping strategy may be exhibited by PNES patients, as indicated by their increased tendency to dissociate. Investigation of resting-state networks may reveal altered routes of information and emotion processing in PNES patients. The authors therefore investigated whether PNES patients differ from healthy controls in their resting-state functional connectivity characteristics and whether these connections are associated with the tendency to dissociate.METHODS: 11 PNES patients without psychiatric comorbidity and 12 healthy controls underwent task-related paradigms (picture-encoding and Stroop paradigms) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Global cognitive performance was tested using the Raven's Matrices test and participants completed questionnaires for evaluating dissociation. Functional connectivity analysis on rsfMRI was based on seed regions extracted from task-related fMRI activation maps.RESULTS: The patients displayed a significantly lower cognitive performance and significantly higher dissociation scores. No significant differences were found between the picture-encoding and Stroop colour-naming activation maps between controls and patients with PNES. However, functional connectivity maps from the rsfMRI were statistically different. For PNES patients, stronger connectivity values between areas involved in emotion (insula), executive control (inferior frontal gyrus and parietal cortex) and movement (precentral sulcus) were observed, which were significantly associated with dissociation scores.CONCLUSION: The abnormal, strong functional connectivity in PNES patients provides a neurophysiological correlate for the underlying psychoform and somatoform dissociation mechanism where emotion can influence executive control, resulting in altered motor function (eg, seizure-like episodes)",

PATIENT: A 40-year-old man with a 2-week course of acute-onset amnesia, abulia, poor concentration, hypersomnolence, and reclusiveness. INTERVENTION: Functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large gadolinium-enhancing plaque in the left anterior thalamus and other demyelinating plaques in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, consistent with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. His symptoms persisted at the 7-month follow-up. The patient's resting state functional magnetic resonance image demonstrated an asymmetric disruption of the posterior cingulate portion of the default mode network ipsilateral to the left thalamic lesion. CONCLUSIONS: A large multiple sclerosis plaque in the deep gray matter altered the resting state functional connectivity in a patient presenting with pure cognitive dysfunction. Such altered connectivity may underlie cognitive symptoms in neurologic disease. In addition, this case provides lesional evidence of default mode network circuitry involving the pathways of the circuit of Papez.",

The combined recording of EEG and fMRI allows the temporal correlation between fluctuations of the RSNs and the dynamics of EEG spectral amplitudes. So far, only relationships between several EEG frequency bands and some RSNs could be demonstrated, but no study accounted for the spatial distribution of frequency domain EEG.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we report on the topographic association of EEG spectral fluctuations and RSN dynamics using EEG covariance mapping. All RSNs displayed significant covariance maps across a broad EEG frequency range. Cluster analysis of the found covariance maps revealed the common standard EEG frequency bands. We found significant differences between covariance maps of the different RSNs and these differences depended on the frequency band.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data supports the physiological and neuronal origin of the RSNs and substantiates the assumption that the standard EEG frequency bands and their topographies can be seen as electrophysiological signatures of underlying distributed neuronal networks.",

In three large and diverse samples coming from two different cultures (Russian and Taiwanese), spontaneous EEG data and retrospective questionnaire measures of subject's state, thoughts, and feelings during the EEG registration were collected. Regression analyses showed that appearance of spontaneous self-referential thoughts was best predicted by enhanced alpha activity within the DMN. Diminished theta and delta activity in the superior frontal gyrus and enhanced beta activity in the postcentral gyrus added to the prediction. The enhanced alpha activity prevailed in the posterior DMN hub in Russian, but in the anterior DMN hub in Taiwanese participants. Possible cross-cultural differences in personality and attitudes underlying this difference are discussed",

Most current studies estimate the networks in a sequential approach, i.e., they identify each individual subject's network independently to other subjects, and then estimate the group network from the subjects networks. This one-way flow of information prevents one subject's network estimation benefiting from other subjects. We propose a hierarchical Markov random field model, which takes into account both the within-subject spatial coherence and between-subject consistency of the network label map. Both population and subject network maps are estimated simultaneously using a Gibbs sampling approach in a Monte Carlo expectation maximization framework. We compare our approach to two alternative groupwise fMRI clustering methods, based on K-means and normalized Cuts, using both synthetic and real fMRI data. We show that our method is able to estimate more consistent subject label maps, as well as a stable group label map",

In parallel, functional MRI studies have demonstrated changes in brain activation patterns accompanying cognitive development. Despite these advances, studying the maturation of functional brain networks underlying brain development continues to present unique scientific and methodological challenges. Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) has emerged as a novel method for investigating the development of large-scale functional brain networks in infants and young children. We review existing rsfMRI developmental studies and discuss how this method has begun to make significant contributions to our understanding of maturing brain organization. In particular, rsfMRI has been used to complement studies in other modalities investigating the emergence of functional segregation and integration across short and long-range connections spanning the entire brain. We show that rsfMRI studies help to clarify and reveal important principles of functional brain development, including a shift from diffuse to focal activation patterns, and simultaneous pruning of local connectivity and strengthening of long-range connectivity with age. The insights gained from these studies also shed light on potentially disrupted functional networks underlying atypical cognitive development associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. We conclude by identifying critical gaps in the current literature, discussing methodological issues, and suggesting avenues for future research.",

Independent component analysis was first applied to the resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data acquired from 12 healthy young subjects for the separation of RSNs. Four sensory (lateral and medial visual, auditory, and sensory-motor) RSNs and four cognitive (default-mode, self-referential, dorsal and ventral attention) RSNs were identified. Gaussian Bayesian network (BN) learning approach was then used for the examination of the conditional dependencies among these RSNs and the construction of the network-to-network directional connectivity patterns. The BN based results demonstrated that sensory networks and cognitive networks were hierarchically organized. Specially, we found the sensory networks were highly intra-dependent and the cognitive networks were strongly intra-influenced. In addition, the results depicted dominant bottom-up connectivity from sensory networks to cognitive networks in which the self-referential and the default-mode networks might play respectively important roles in the process of resting-state information transfer and integration. The present study characterized the global connectivity relations among RSNs and delineated more characteristics of spontaneous activity dynamics.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Memantine is an approved symptomatic treatment for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease that reduces the excitotoxic effects of hyperactive glutamatergic transmission. However, the exact mechanism of the effect of memantine in Alzheimer's disease patients is poorly understood. Importantly, the default mode network (DMN), which plays a key role in attention, is hypoactive in Alzheimer's disease and is under glutamatergic control. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of memantine on the activity of the DMN in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 15 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, seven treated with memantine (mean ± SD age 77 ± 8 years, mean ± SD Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 16 ± 5) and eight with placebo (mean ± SD age 76 ± 6 years, mean ± SD MMSE score 13 ± 1), were acquired at baseline (T0) and after 6 months of treatment (T6). Resting state components were extracted after spatial normalization in individual patients with independent component analysis. The consistency of the components was assessed using ICASSO and the DMN was recognized through spatial correlation with a pre-defined template. Voxel-based statistical analyses were performed to study the change in DMN activity from T0 to T6 in the two groups. RESULTS: At T0, the two groups showed similar DMN activity except in the precuneus and cuneus, where the patients who started treatment with memantine had slightly greater activity (p < 0.05 corrected for familywise error [FWE]). The prospective comparison between T0 and T6 in the treated patients showed increased DMN activation mapping in the precuneus (p < 0.05, FWE corrected), while the prospective comparison in the untreated patients did not show significant changes. The treatment × time interaction term was significant at p < 0.05, FWE corrected. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a positive effect of memantine treatment in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, resulting in an increased resting DMN activity in the precuneus region over 6 months. Future studies confirming the present findings are required to further demonstrate the beneficial effects of memantine on the DMN in Alzheimer's disease.",

Here we used a repetition priming functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm that directly contrasted the effects of stimulus and decision changes to identify the underlying brain systems. Direct repetition of stimulus features caused marked reductions in posterior regions of the inferior temporal lobe that were insensitive to whether the decision was held constant or changed between study and test. By contrast, prefrontal cortex showed repetition effects that were sensitive to the exact stimulus-to-decision mapping. Analysis of resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the dissociated repetition effects are embedded within distinct brain systems. Regions that were sensitive to changes in the stimulus correlated with perceptual cortices, whereas the decision changes attenuated activity in regions correlated with middle-temporal regions and a frontoparietal control system. These results thus explain the long-known dissociation between perceptual and conceptual components of priming by revealing how a single experience can separately influence distinct, concurrently active brain systems.",

The observed agreement between the results of RS fMRI and DT MRI tractography studies in healthy individuals is encouraging and offers interesting hypotheses to be tested in patients with AD, a MCI, and other dementias in order to improve our understanding of their pathobiology in vivo. In this review,we describe the major findings obtained in AD using RS fMRI and DT MRI tractography, and discuss how the relationship between structure and function of the brain networks in AD may be better understood through the application of MR-based technology.

We examined the effect of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) on the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) during the resting state, and the correlation between changes of mood and fALFF following ATD. We manipulated the central serotonergic levels of 21 right-handed healthy males (mean age=21.57±1.83 years) following ATD. A within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and counter-balanced design was employed. Following ATD or sham depletion, subjects completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and underwent 5-min R-fMRI scans. Our findings show that the fALFF of the middle orbitofrontal cortex and precuneus was significantly decreased and the fALFF of the superior parietal lobule, paracentral lobule and precentral gyrus was significantly increased after ATD. The fALFF of the orbitofrontal cortex was negatively correlated with depressive mood. The fALFF of the superior parietal lobule was positively correlated with anger-hostility and the fALFF of the paracentral lobule was negatively correlated with vigor-activity. The middle orbitofrontal cortex plays a key role in serotonin depletion-induced brain changes and individual differences in depressive mood change.

However, little is known about intrinsic functional connectivity in these patients. Methods: Between January 2009 and February 2010, we studied patients with schizophrenia who had persistent and treatment-refractory AVHs in comparison with healthy controls. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we studied the functional connectivity of multiple resting state networks (RSNs) and their relation to symptom severity. We analyzed the data using a spatial group independent component analysis, and we used random-effects t tests to compare spatial components between groups. Results: There were 10 patients and 14 controls enrolled in this study. In total, 16 RSNs were identified, from which we selected 4 networks of interest for further analyses. Within a speech-related network, patients showed increased connectivity in bilateral temporal regions and decreased connectivity in the cingulate cortex. Within 2 additional RSNs associated with attention and executive control, respectively, patients exhibited abnormal connectivity in the precuneus and right lateral prefrontal areas. We found correlations between measures of AVH severity and functional connectivity of the left anterior cingulate, left superior temporal gyrus and right lateral prefrontal cortex. Limitations: The relatively small sample size, the patients' use of antipsychotic medication and the lack of a clinical control group have to be considered as potential limitations. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that disrupted intrinsic connectivity of a speech-related network could underlie persistent AVHs in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the occurrence of hallucinatory symptoms seems to modulate RSNs associated with attention and executive control.",

Selective visualization of the second low frequency peak revealed waves of activity that typically began in the secondary somatosensory cortex and propagated to the primary motor cortex.CONCLUSION:To date, analysis of these fluctuations has focused on the detection of functional networks assuming steady state conditions. These results suggest that detailed examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the low frequency fluctuations may provide more insight into brain function, and add a new perspective to the analysis of resting state fMRI data.",

    abstract = "Symptoms of cognitive impairment during smoking withdrawal can be ameliorated by nicotine replacement. To define brain mechanisms contributing to this therapeutic effect, we conducted a functional connectivity analysis of resting-state fMRI in 17 abstinent smokers following nicotine replacement in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. We found that individual differences in cognitive withdrawal symptom improvements after nicotine replacement were associated with increased inverse coupling between executive control and default mode brain networks. Furthermore, improvements in withdrawal symptoms were negatively correlated with altered functional connectivity within the default mode network, and with connectivity between the executive control network and regions implicated in reward processing. These findings demonstrate that nicotine administration in abstinent smokers modulates dynamic interactions between large-scale cognitive brain networks in the resting state. We specifically highlight the role of midline and prefrontal network regions in the neurocognitive response to nicotine pharmacotherapy and suggest that altered functional connectivity patterns of these networks reflect their engagement in reward and salience processing during smoking withdrawal. Individual differences in resting brain functional connectivity may predict therapeutic outcomes in nicotine addiction and other conditions associated with cognitive impairments.",

    abstract = "We conducted a systematic review on resting state cerebral blood flow activities found in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and during acute effects of cannabinoids and opioids, mental states that can be profoundly different from normal functioning. A main goal was to identify connections of cerebral blood flow measure and regional brain activity patterns associated with subjective experiences and to find out whether there are similarities between the three mental states. The present study reviewed systematically the current state of research with respect to cannabinoids and opioids on resting state activity patterns as investigated by different neuroimaging techniques. Twenty-two studies encompassing different neuroimaging techniques were selected. Cerebral perfusion and resting blood flow measure by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (resting-state fMRI) during acute cannabinoids or opioids challenges were compared to findings in patients with FEP. The total number of subjects included in this review encompassed 279 FEP/controls (mean age = 28 ± 8.6 years, 40.1\% females), 315 participants with cannabinoids (mean age = 29 ± 7.1 years, 31.8\% females) and 113 participants with opioids (mean age = 30 ± 3.9 years, 17.3\% females).We found that effects on regional activity were highly conflicting. However, there was some consistent evidence suggesting positive symptoms of FEP and depersonalization experiences after cannabis administration both result in an increased anterior cingulate activity, an important area in the default made network",

Consistent with the notion that synesthesia results from hyperconnectivity, functional connectivity analysis (adopting independent component analysis and seed-based correlation analysis) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 12 grapheme-color synesthetes and 12 nonsynesthetic control subjects revealed, in addition to increased intranetwork connectivity, both a global and a specific (medial and lateral visual networks to a right frontoparietal network) increase of intrinsic internetwork connectivity in grapheme-color synesthesia. Moreover, this increased intrinsic network connectivity reflected the strength of synesthetic experiences. These findings constitute the first direct evidence of increased functional network connectivity in synesthesia. In addition to this significant contribution to the understanding of the neural mechanisms of synesthesia, our results have important general implications. In combination with data derived from clinical populations, our data strongly suggest that altered differences in intrinsic network connectivity are directly related to the phenomenology of human experiences",

An "interoceptive" state with the eyes closed is characterized by visual cortex activation, while an "exteroceptive" state with the eyes open is characterized by ocular motor system activity. The impact of the chosen rest condition (eyes open or eyes closed in complete darkness) on the pattern of brain activations during visual stimulation was evaluated in 14 healthy volunteers. During fixation or dim light room illumination, the activation of the visual cortex was larger with the eyes-open rest condition than with the eyes-closed rest condition; however, activation of the lateral geniculate nucleus was smaller. Activations that can be attributed to ocular motor structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, parietal and frontal eye fields, cerebellar vermis, the thalamus, and basal ganglia were larger with the eyes-closed rest condition than with the eyes-open rest condition. BOLD signal decreases of cortical areas that represent visual, somatosensory, auditory, and vestibular functions were seen in the comparison fixation of light emitting diode (LED) minus eyes closed. Thus, the choice of rest condition (either eyes closed or eyes open) is critical for stimulus-induced brain activation patterns. Activity of the ocular motor system as well as deactivation of sensory cortical areas may go undetected with eyes open as rest condition.},

However, in humans, the impact of bilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage on a large-scale neural network such as the default mode network is unknown. To examine this issue, resting fMRI was performed with amnesic patients and control participants. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses revealed robust default network connectivity in amnesia in cortical default network regions such as medial prefrontal cortex, posterior medial cortex, and lateral parietal cortex, as well as evidence of connectivity to residual MTL tissue. Relative to control participants, decreased posterior cingulate cortex connectivity to MTL and increased connectivity to cortical default network regions including lateral parietal and medial prefrontal cortex were observed in amnesic patients. In contrast, somatomotor network connectivity was intact in amnesic patients, indicating that bilateral MTL lesions may selectively impact the default network. Changes in default network connectivity in amnesia were largely restricted to the MTL subsystem, providing preliminary support from MTL amnesic patients that the default network can be fractionated into functionally and structurally distinct components. To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the default network in amnesia",

Fourteen patients with a confirmed diagnosis of cocaine abuse or dependence (CCA) and 16 gender, age, and education-matched healthy controls (HC) completed a cue reactivity task and a resting state scan while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. CCA showed increased activation compared to HC in left dorsolateral prefrontal and bilateral occipital cortex in response to cocaine cues but not to appetitive control stimuli. Moreover, CCA also showed increased activation within the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) for cocaine cues relative to the appetitive stimuli during a hierarchical regression analysis. A negative association between subjective craving and activity in medial posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) was also observed for CCA. CCA exhibited increased resting state correlation (positive) between cue-processing seed regions (OFC and ventral striatum), and negative connectivity between cue-processing regions and PCC/precuneus. These alterations in fcMRI may partially explain the neural basis of increased drug cue salience in CCA.",

Brain networks were first constructed by measuring inter-regional temporal correlations of R-fMRI data within each hemisphere in 86 young, healthy, right-handed adults (38 males and 48 females) followed by a graph-theory analysis. The hemispheric networks exhibit small-world attributes (high clustering and short paths) that are compatible with previous results in the whole-brain functional networks. Furthermore, we found that compared with females, males have a higher normalized clustering coefficient in the right hemispheric network but a lower clustering coefficient in the left hemispheric network, suggesting a gender-hemisphere interaction. Moreover, we observed significant hemisphere-related differences in the regional nodal characteristics in various brain regions, such as the frontal and occipital regions (leftward asymmetry) and the temporal regions (rightward asymmetry), findings that are consistent with previous studies of brain structural and functional asymmetries. Together, our results suggest that the topological organization of human brain functional networks is associated with gender and hemispheres, and they provide insights into the understanding of functional substrates underlying individual differences in behaviors and cognition. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

Spatial analyses of the topography of the spontaneous EEG also show discrete epochs of stable global brain states (so-called microstates), but they remain quasi-stationary for only about 100 ms. In order to test the relationship between the rapidly fluctuating EEG-defined microstates and the slowly oscillating fMRI-defined resting states, we recorded 64-channel EEG in the scanner while subjects were at rest with their eyes closed. Conventional EEG-microstate analysis determined the typical four EEG topographies that dominated across all subjects. The convolution of the time course of these maps with the hemodynamic response function allowed to fit a linear model to the fMRI BOLD responses and revealed four distinct distributed networks. These networks were spatially correlated with four of the resting-state networks (RSNs) that were found by the conventional fMRI group-level independent component analysis (ICA). These RSNs have previously been attributed to phonological processing, visual imagery, attention reorientation, and subjective interoceptive-autonomic processing. We found no EEG-correlate of the default mode network. Thus, the four typical microstates of the spontaneous EEG seem to represent the neurophysiological correlate of four of the RSNs and show that they are fluctuating much more rapidly than fMRI alone suggests.",

    abstract = "Group differences in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity between individuals with autism and typically developing controls have been widely replicated for a small number of discrete brain regions, yet the whole-brain distribution of connectivity abnormalities in autism is not well characterized. It is also unclear whether functional connectivity is sufficiently robust to be used as a diagnostic or prognostic metric in individual patients with autism. We obtained pairwise functional connectivity measurements from a lattice of 7266 regions of interest covering the entire grey matter (26.4 million connections) in a well-characterized set of 40 male adolescents and young adults with autism and 40 age-, sex- and IQ-matched typically developing subjects. A single resting state blood oxygen level-dependent scan of 8 min was used for the classification in each subject. A leave-one-out classifier successfully distinguished autism from control subjects with 83\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity for a total accuracy of 79\% (P = 1.1 × 10(-7)). In subjects <20 years of age, the classifier performed at 89\% accuracy (P = 5.4 × 10(-7)). In a replication dataset consisting of 21 individuals from six families with both affected and unaffected siblings, the classifier performed at 71\% accuracy (91\% accuracy for subjects <20 years of age). Classification scores in subjects with autism were significantly correlated with the Social Responsiveness Scale (P = 0.05), verbal IQ (P = 0.02) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic's combined social and communication subscores (P = 0.05). An analysis of informative connections demonstrated that region of interest pairs with strongest correlation values were most abnormal in autism. Negatively correlated region of interest pairs showed higher correlation in autism (less anticorrelation), possibly representing weaker inhibitory connections, particularly for long connections (Euclidean distance >10 cm). Brain regions showing greatest differences included regions of the default mode network, superior parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus and anterior insula. Overall, classification accuracy was better for younger subjects, with differences between autism and control subjects diminishing after 19 years of age. Classification scores of unaffected siblings of individuals with autism were more similar to those of the control subjects than to those of the subjects with autism. These findings indicate feasibility of a functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic assay for autism.",

Dopamine (DA) signalling seems to play a key role in modulating the prefrontal cortex, since both DA deficiency and excess nega tively influence the efficiency of cognitive functions. The present study explores the effect of a functional polymorphism (Val158Met) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene on the set-shifting abilities and prefrontal functional connectivity of patients with anorexia nervosa. Methods: All participants performed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, and a subsample underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We included 166 patients with DSM-IV lifetime anorexia nervosa and 140 healthy women in our study. Both underweight and weight-recovered patients with anorexia nervosa showed high levels of perseveration, but only in the under weight group did the Val158Met polymorphism affect cognitive performance, showing the U-shaped curve characteristic of increased DA signalling in the prefrontal cortex. Underweight patients with anorexia nervosa who are Met homozygotes had significantly higher levels of perseveration and increased prefrontal functional connectivity than underweight patients in the other genotype groups, indicating abnormal regional cortical processing. Limitations: Although our data show that grey matter reduction in starving patients with anorexia nervosa did not explain our findings, the cross-sectional design of the present study did not allow us to distinguish between the effects of starvation and those of low estrogen levels. Conclusion: Starvation affects DA release in the prefrontal cortex of patients with anorexia nervosa with different effects on executive functioning and prefrontal functional connectivity according to the COMT genotype. This observation has several therapeutic implications that need to be addressed by future studies",

    abstract = "The analysis of functional connectivity in fMRI can be severely affected by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. While some of these artifactual signal changes can be reduced by physiological noise correction routines, signal fluctuations induced by slower breath-to-breath changes in the depth and rate of breathing are typically not removed. These slower respiration-induced signal changes occur at low frequencies and spatial locations similar to the fluctuations used to infer functional connectivity, and have been shown to significantly affect seed-ROI or seed-voxel based functional connectivity analysis, particularly in the default mode network. In this study, we investigate the effect of respiration variations on functional connectivity maps derived from independent component analysis (ICA) of resting-state data. Regions of the default mode network were identified by deactivations during a lexical decision task. Variations in respiration were measured independently and correlated with the MRI time series data. ICA appears to separate the default mode network and the respiration-related changes in most cases. In some cases, however, the component automatically identified as the default mode network was the same as the component identified as respiration-related. Furthermore, in most cases the time series associated with the default mode network component was still significantly correlated with changes in respiration volume per time, suggesting that current methods of ICA may not completely separate respiration from the default mode network. An independent measure of the respiration provides valuable information to help distinguish the default mode network from respiration-related signal changes, and to assess the degree of residual respiration related effects",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a core symptom of schizophrenia, they also occur in non-psychotic individuals, in the absence of other psychotic, affective, cognitive and negative symptoms. AVH have been hypothesized to result from deviant integration of inferior frontal, parahippocampal and superior temporal brain areas. However, a direct link between dysfunctional connectivity and AVH has not yet been established. To determine whether hallucinations are indeed related to aberrant connectivity, AVH should be studied in isolation, for example in non-psychotic individuals with AVH. Method Resting-state connectivity was investigated in 25 non-psychotic subjects with AVH and 25 matched control subjects using seed regression analysis with the (1) left and (2) right inferior frontal, (3) left and (4) right superior temporal and (5) left parahippocampal areas as the seed regions. To correct for cardiorespiratory (CR) pulsatility rhythms in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, heartbeat and respiration were monitored during scanning and the fMRI data were corrected for these rhythms using the image-based method for retrospective correction of physiological motion effects RETROICOR. RESULTS: In comparison with the control group, non-psychotic individuals with AVH showed increased connectivity between the left and the right superior temporal regions and also between the left parahippocampal region and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Moreover, this group did not show a negative correlation between the left superior temporal region and the right inferior frontal region, as was observed in the healthy control group. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant connectivity of frontal, parahippocampal and superior temporal brain areas can be specifically related to the predisposition to hallucinate in the auditory domain",

    abstract = "Neural processing is based on interactions between functionally specialized areas that can be described in terms of functional or effective connectivity. Functional connectivity is often assessed by task-free, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whereas effective connectivity is usually estimated from task-based fMRI time-series. To investigate whether different connectivity approaches assess similar network topologies in the same subjects, we scanned 36 right-handed volunteers with resting-state fMRI followed by active-state fMRI involving a hand movement task. Time-series information was extracted from identical locations defined from individual activation maxima during the motor task. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was applied to the motor task time-series to estimate endogenous and context-dependent effective connectivity. In addition, functional connectivity was computed for both the rest and the motor task condition by means of inter-regional time-series correlations. At the group-level, we found strong interactions between the motor areas of interest in all three connectivity analyses. However, although the sample size warranted 90\% power to detect correlations of medium effect size, resting-state functional connectivity was only weakly correlated with both task-based functional and task-based effective connectivity estimates for corresponding region-pairs of the subjects. In contrast, task-based functional connectivity showed strong positive correlations with DCM effective connectivity parameters. In conclusion, resting-state and task-based connectivity reflect different components of functional integration that particularly depend on the functional state in which the subject is being scanned. Therefore, resting-state fMRI and DCM should be used as complementary measures when assessing functional brain networks",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional MRI (fMRI) studies could provide crucial information on the neural mechanisms of motor recovery in patients with stroke. Resting-state fMRI is applicable to patients with stroke who are not capable of proper performance of the motor task. In this study, we explored neural correlates of motor recovery in patients with stroke by investigating longitudinal changes in resting-state functional connectivity of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1). METHODS: A longitudinal observational study using repeated fMRI experiments was conducted in 12 patients with stroke. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired 4 times over a period of 6 months. Patients participated in the first session of fMRI shortly after onset and thereafter in subsequent sessions at 1, 3, and 6 months after onset. Resting-state functional connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 was assessed and compared with that of healthy subjects. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, patients demonstrated higher functional connectivity with the ipsilesional frontal and parietal cortices, bilateral thalamus, and cerebellum. Instead, functional connectivity with the contralesional M1 and occipital cortex were decreased in patients with stroke. Functional connectivity between the ipsilesional and contralesional M1 showed the most asymmetry at 1 month after onset to the ipsilesional side. Functional connectivity of the ipsilesional M1 with the contralesional thalamus, supplementary motor area, and middle frontal gyrus at onset was positively correlated with motor recovery at 6 months after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state fMRI elicited distinctive but comparable results with previous task-based fMRI, presenting complementary and practical values for use in the study of patients with stroke.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: The recent upsurge in interest about pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) has spurred the need for greater understanding of its neurobiology. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have implicated fronto-temporal dysfunction in pediatric BD. However, recent data suggest that task-dependent neural changes account for a small fraction of the brain's energy consumption. We now report the first use of task-independent spontaneous resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to study the neural underpinnings of pediatric BD. METHODS: We acquired task-independent RSFC blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while participants were at rest and also a high-resolution anatomical image (both at three Tesla) in BD and control youths (n = 15 of each). We focused, on the basis of prior research, on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), amygdala, and accumbens. Image processing and group-level analyses followed that of prior work. RESULTS: Our primary analysis showed that pediatric BD participants had significantly greater negative RSFC between the left DLPFC and the right superior temporal gyrus versus control subjects. Secondary analyses using partial correlation showed that BD and control youths had opposite phase relationships between spontaneous RSFC fluctuations in the left DLPFC and right superior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that pediatric BD is characterized by altered task-independent functional connectivity in a fronto-temporal circuit that is also implicated in working memory and learning. Further study is warranted to determine the effects of age, gender, development, and treatment on this circuit in pediatric BD.",

The effects of ELS exposure on neural network organization have not been differentiated from the effect of depression. Furthermore, many individuals exposed to ELS do not develop depression, yet the network organization patterns differentiating resiliency versus susceptibility to the depressogenic effects of ELS are not clear. Method Women aged 18-44 years with either a history of ELS and no history of depression (n=7), a history of ELS and current or past depression (n=19), or a history of neither ELS nor depression (n=12) underwent a resting-state 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. An emotion regulation brain network consisting of 21 nodes was described using graph analyses and compared between groups. RESULTS: Group differences in network topology involved decreased global connectivity and hub-like properties for the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and decreased local network connectivity for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) among resilient individuals. Decreased local connectivity and increased hub-like properties of the left amygdala, decreased hub-like properties of the dACC and decreased local connectivity of the left vlPFC were observed among susceptible individuals. Regression analyses suggested that the severity of ELS (measured by self-report) correlated negatively with global connectivity and hub-like qualities for the left dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest functional neural connectivity patterns specific to ELS exposure and resiliency versus susceptibility to the depressogenic effects of ELS exposure",

Specifically, we extract the fMRI BOLD signals from the two ends of a white matter fiber derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, and examine their Granger causalities. Our experimental results showed that Granger causalities on white matter fibers are significantly stronger than the causalities between brain regions that are not fiber-connected, demonstrating the structural underpinning of functional causality seen in resting state fMRI data. Cross-session and cross-subject comparisons showed that our observations are reproducible both within and across subjects. Also, the fiber-centered GCA approach was applied on natural stimulus fMRI data and our results suggest that Granger causalities on DTI-derived fibers reveal significant temporal changes, offering novel insights into the functional dynamics of the brain.",

Spatial ICA also makes it possible to investigate functional connectivity at the network level, termed functional network connectivity (FNC). The dynamics of each network (ICA component) which may consist of several remote regions is described by the ICA time-course of that network; hence FNC studies statistical dependencies among ICA time-courses. In this paper, we compare comprehensively FNC in the resting state and during performance of an auditory oddball task in 28 healthy subject and 28 schizophrenic patients on relevant (non-artifactual) brain networks. The results show abnormalities both in the resting state and during the task but also the difference of the two states. Moreover, our results suggest that using data both in the resting-state and during the task can better separate the two groups. It is demonstrated that for three pairs of networks, the FNC of the healthy controls resides within a confined region of the correlation space whereas patients behave more sparsely. This can be used to discriminate the two groups based on partitioning the correlation space during the resting state and the task data",

When determining whether two brain regions exhibit significant correlation due to true functional connectivity, one must account for the background spatial correlation inherent in neuroimaging data. We define background correlation as spatiotemporal correlation in the data caused by factors other than neurophysiologically based functional associations such as scanner induced correlations and image preprocessing. We develop a 4D spatiotemporal wavelet packet resampling method which generates surrogate data that preserves only the average background spatial correlation within an axial slice, across axial slices, and through each voxel time series, while excluding the specific correlations due to true functional relationships. We also extend an amplitude adjustment algorithm which adjusts our surrogate data to closely match the amplitude distribution of the original data. Our method improves upon existing wavelet-based methods and extends them to 4D.

Little is known about genetic influence on functional connectivity status, although studies on schizophrenia have reported an abnormal default mode network (DMN). We sought to identify putative genetic vulnerability markers by examining whether aberrant DMN connectivity was present in GHR subjects with high genetic loading.METHOD: Sixteen GHR subjects who had at least two relatives with schizophrenia and 16 age- and sex-matched controls were included and scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. A posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed region connectivity analysis was used to identify the DMN. Correlations between severity of psychopathology, level of genetic loading and DMN connectivity were calculated.RESULTS: The DMN network in GHR subjects showed reduced functional connectivity in the prefrontal areas, PCC, and precuneus. In addition, this reduced connectivity in the prefrontal cortices correlated with total and general scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. GHR subjects having two first-degree relatives with schizophrenia showed a trend toward greater reduction in DMN connectivity in the precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex.CONCLUSION: This study suggests significant abnormalities in the DMN of subjects at GHR of schizophrenia. Alterations of DMN connectivity in the prefrontal cortex may reflect psychopathologies such as an inability to allocate resources properly between internal thoughts and external stimuli. Dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex and precuneus might be related to genetic risk for schizophrenia.",

    abstract = "Resting state functional connectivity, which is defined as temporal correlation of spontaneous activity between diverse brain regions, has been reported to form resting state networks (RSNs), consisting of a specific set of brain regions, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recently, studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) reported that NIRS signals also show temporal correlation between different brain regions. The local relationship between NIRS and fMRI signals has been examined by simultaneously recording these signals when participants perform tasks or respond to stimuli. However, the NIRS-fMRI signal relationship during the resting state has been reported only between NIRS signals obtained within limited regions and whole brain fMRI signals. Therefore, it remains unclear whether NIRS signals obtained at diverse regions correlate with regional fMRI signals close to the NIRS measurement channels, especially in relation to the RSNs. In this study, we tested whether the signals measured by these different modalities during the resting state have the consistent characteristics of the RSNs. Specifically, NIRS signals during the resting state were acquired over the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices while whole brain fMRI data was simultaneously recorded. First, by projecting the NIRS channel positions over the cerebral cortical surface, we identified the most likely anatomical locations of all NIRS channels used in the study. Next, to investigate the regional signal relationship between NIRS and fMRI, we calculated the cross-correlation between NIRS signals and fMRI signals in the brain regions adjacent to each NIRS channel. For each NIRS channel, we observed the local maxima of correlation coefficients between NIRS and fMRI signals within a radius of 2 voxels from the projection point. Furthermore, we also found that highly correlated voxels with the NIRS signal were mainly localized within brain tissues for all NIRS channels, with the exception of 2 frontal channels. Finally, by calculating the correlation between NIRS signals at a channel and whole brain fMRI signals, we observed that NIRS signals correlate with fMRI signals not only within brain regions adjacent to NIRS channels but also within distant brain regions constituting RSNs, such as the dorsal attention, fronto-parietal control, and default mode networks. These results support the idea that NIRS signals obtained at several cortical regions during the resting state mainly reflect regional spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations that originate from spontaneous cortical activity, and include information that characterizes the RSNs. Because NIRS is relatively easy to use and a less physically demanding neuroimaging technique, our findings should facilitate a broad application of this technique to examine RSNs, especially for clinical populations and conditions unsuitable for fMRI",

Next, low frequency blood oxygenation dependent (BOLD) related fluctuations (LFBF) data were acquired at rest and during steady-state exposure to neutral, positive and negative pictures. LFBF correlations were calculated between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and limbic regions--amygdala (AMYG), pallidostriatum (PST) and medial thalamus (MTHAL) and used as a measure of cortico-limbic connectivity.RESULTS:Depressed patients had increased activation of cortical and limbic regions. At rest and during exposure to neutral, positive, and negative pictures cortico-limbic LFBF correlations were decreased in depressed patients compared to healthy subjects.CONCLUSIONS:The finding of increased activation of limbic regions and decreased LFBF correlations between ACC and limbic regions is consistent with the hypothesis that decreased cortical regulation of limbic activation in response to negative stimuli may be present in depression.",

    abstract = "Aim: There is accumulating evidence that food consumption is controlled by a wide range of brain circuits outside of the homeostatic system. Activation in these brain circuits may override the homeostatic system and also contribute to the enormous increase of obesity. However, little is known about the influence of hormonal signals on the brain's non-homeostatic system. Thus, selective insulin action in the brain was investigated by using intranasal application. Methods: We performed 'resting-state' functional magnetic resonance imaging in 17 healthy lean female subjects to assess intrinsic brain activity by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) before, 30 and 90 min after application of intranasal insulin. Results: Here, we showed that insulin modulates intrinsic brain activity in the hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore, we could show that the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex response to insulin is associated with body mass index. Conclusion: This demonstrates that hormonal signals as insulin may reduce food intake by modifying the reward and prefrontal circuitry of the human brain, thereby potentially decreasing the rewarding properties of food. Due to the alarming increase in obesity worldwide, it is of great importance to identify neural mechanisms of interaction between the homeostatic and non-homeostatic system to generate new targets for obesity therapy",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: Using resting-state (RS) fMRI, we investigated the functional integrity of the default-mode network (DMN) in cognitively unimpaired patients with Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: RS fMRI at 3 T was collected in 16 cognitively unimpaired patients with PD and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Single-subject and group-level independent component analysis was used to investigate differences in functional connectivity within the DMN in patients with PD and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in RS functional connectivity were related to structural abnormalities. RESULTS: Patients with PD compared with controls showed a decreased functional connectivity of the right medial temporal lobe and bilateral inferior parietal cortex within the DMN. Although patients with PD were cognitively unimpaired, the decreased DMN connectivity significantly correlated with cognitive parameters but not with disease duration, motor impairment, or levodopa therapy. The analysis of regional volume differences did not reveal any differences in local gray matter between patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed a functional disruption of the DMN in cognitively unimpaired patients with PD, in the absence of significant structural differences between patients and controls. We hypothesize that a dysfunction of the DMN connectivity may have a role in the development of cognitive decline in PD",

Here we tested two distinct possibilities: (1) functional networks arise largely from structural connectivity constraints, and generally require direct interactions between functionally coupled regions mediated by white-matter tracts; and (2) functional networks emerge flexibly with the development of normal cognition and behavior and can be realized in multiple structural architectures. We conducted resting-state fMRI in eight adult humans with complete agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) and normal intelligence, and compared their data to those from eight healthy matched controls. We performed three main analyses: anatomical region-of-interest-based correlations to test homotopic functional connectivity, independent component analysis (ICA) to reveal functional networks with a data-driven approach, and ICA-based interhemispheric correlation analysis. Both groups showed equivalently strong homotopic BOLD correlation. Surprisingly, almost all of the group-level independent components identified in controls were observed in AgCC and were predominantly bilaterally symmetric. The results argue that a normal complement of resting-state networks and intact functional coupling between the hemispheres can emerge in the absence of the corpus callosum, favoring the second over the first possibility listed above.",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patterns of functional connectivity of cortical regions responsible for auditory processing and executive functions differ in children with unilateral hearing loss (UHL) versus their normal-hearing (NH) siblings.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.SETTING: Academic medical center.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Children with severe-to-profound UHL (9 right UHL, 7 left UHL) and 10 NH sibling controls were imaged using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI). All MRI images were transformed to a single common atlas; regions of interest (ROI) were chosen based on previous literature and unpublished results. Mean regionwise correlations and conjunction analyses were performed across 34 seed ROIs to identify temporally synchronized, low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in the resting state blood oxygenation level-dependent signal that reveal functionally related regions.RESULTS: Mean regionwise Student t tests found a left posterior opercular region with more correlated resting state activity with the inferior parietal lobule seed in the children with both left and right UHL than NH. In conjunction analysis, 4 regions showed different resting-state functional interactions between the NH and both UHL groups. These differences were in left medial globus pallidus, left middle temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and mid-cingulate cortex. These regions include areas associated with auditory processing, executive function, and memory formation.CONCLUSIONS: Resting state fcMRI identified differences in brain network interconnections between children with UHL and NH and may inform further investigation into the educational and behavioral difficulties experienced by children with UHL.",

The simultaneous acquisition of arterial spin labeling (ASL) and BOLD data represents a useful technique to more fully characterize the neurovascular underpinnings of functional brain response to cognition. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) study of episodic memory encoding to investigate whether age is related to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and BOLD response in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Results demonstrated a significant reduction in resting-state CBF in older compared to young adults. Conversely, older adults showed significantly increased CBF but not BOLD response in the MTL during picture encoding relative to young adults. Correlations between CBF response and cognition were demonstrated whereas associations with BOLD were not observed. Stroke risk was associated with both CBF and BOLD response. Results suggest that aging effects on CBF and BOLD responses to encoding are dissociable and that cerebrovascular alterations contribute to findings of age-related differences.",

    abstract = "Modern MRI image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining MRI protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol on a 3-T MRI scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition (\~{}1-5\% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher (\~{}<10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures (ASL exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated ROI placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern MRI modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols",

We particularly focused on low-level sensory areas (primary somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices), the thalamus, and pain (insula), memory (hippocampus) circuits, and the default mode network (DMN), the latter three to examine higher-order brain regions. The results indicate that, while fc-fMRI patterns did not significantly differ (p<0.005; 20-voxel cluster threshold) in sensory cortex and in the DMN between the pre- and anesthetized conditions, fc-fMRI in high-order cognitive regions (i.e. memory and pain circuits) was significantly altered by anesthesia. These findings provide further evidence that fc-fMRI reflects intrinsic brain properties, while also demonstrating that 0.5 MAC sevoflurane anesthesia preferentially modulates higher-order connections",

    abstract = "INTRODUCTION: In idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), a normal electroencephalogram between generalized spike and wave (GSW) discharges is believed to reflect normal brain function. However, some studies indicate that even excluding GSW-related errors, IGE patients perform poorly on sustained attention task, the deficit being worse as a function of disease duration. We hypothesized that at least in a subset of structures which are normally involved in sustained attention, resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is different in IGE patients compared to controls and that some of the changes are related to disease duration.METHOD: Seeds were selected based on a sustained attention study in controls. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was obtained from 14 IGE patients and 14 matched controls. After physiological noise removal, the mean time-series of each seed was used as a regressor in a general linear model to detect regions that showed correlation with the seed. In patients, duration factor was defined based on epilepsy duration. Between-group differences weighted by the duration factor were evaluated with mixed-effects model. Correlation was then evaluated in IGE patients between the FC, averaged over each significant cluster, and the duration factor.RESULTS: Eight of 18 seeds showed significant difference in FC across groups. However, only for seeds in the medial superior frontal and precentral gyri and in the medial prefrontal area, average FC taken over significant clusters showed high correlation with the duration factor. These 3 seeds showed changes in FC respectively with the premotor and superior frontal gyrus, the dorsal premotor, and the supplementary motor area plus precentral gyrus.CONCLUSION: Alterations of FC in IGE patients are not limited to the frontal areas. However, as indicated by specificity analysis, patients with long history of disease show changes in FC mainly within the frontal areas",

However, the functional and anatomical connectivities between hippocampus and other regions are rarely concurrently investigated in schizophrenia. In the present study, both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed on 17 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy subjects. Resting-state functional connectivities of the bilateral hippocampi were separately analyzed by selecting the anterior hippocampus as region of interest. The fornix body was reconstructed by diffusion tensor tractography, and the integrity of this tract was evaluated using fractional anisotropy (FA). In patients with schizophrenia, the bilateral hippocampi showed reduced functional connectivities to some regions which have been reported to be involved in episodic memory, such as posterior cingulate cortex, extrastriate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and parahippocampus gyrus. We speculated that these reduced connectivity may reflect the disconnectivity within a neural network related to the anterior hippocampus in schizophrenia. Meanwhile the mean FA of the fornix body was significantly reduced in patients, indicating the damage in the hippocampal anatomical connectivity in schizophrenia. The concurrence of the functional disconnectivity and damaged anatomical connectivity between the hippocampus and other regions in schizophrenia suggest that the functional-anatomical relationship need to be further investigated.",

Brain activity was studied both at rest and during an encoding memory paradigm using blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Resting fMRI revealed increased "default mode network" (involving retrosplenial, medial temporal, and medial-prefrontal cortical areas) coactivation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. The encoding task produced greater hippocampal activation in epsilon4-carriers relative to noncarriers. Neither result could be explained by differences in memory performance, brain morphology, or resting cerebral blood flow.

These 'social' and 'tool' systems, however, might not constitute intrinsic neural networks per se, but rather only come online as needed to support retrieval of domain-specific information during social- or tool-related cognitive tasks. To address this issue, we functionally localized two regions in lateral temporal cortex activated when subjects perform social- and tool conceptual tasks. We then compared the strength of the correlations with these seed regions during rs-fcMRI.

Compared with healthy controls, increased ReHo were found in the left superior temporal gyrus, cerebellum posterior lobe (tuber), cerebellum anterior lobe (culmen), the right cerebellar tonsil and bilateral fusiform gyrus (p<0.05, corrected). 3. There was no correlation between the ReHo values in any brain region detected in our study and the patients' age, years of education, illness duration, HRSD total score and its symptom factors.LIMITATION: The influence of antidepressants to the brain activity in TRD patients was not fully eliminated.CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of TRD may be attributed to abnormal neural activity in multiple brain regions.",

    abstract = "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is proving to be an effective tool for mapping the long-range functional connections of the brain in both health and disease. One of the primary measures of connectivity is the correlation between the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) time series observed in different brain regions. The computation of the correlation is often dominated by the presence of a strong global component that can introduce significant variability across functional connectivity maps acquired from different experimental scans or subjects. To address this issue, a variety of global signal correction methods have been proposed, but there is currently a lack of a clear consensus on the best approach to use. Furthermore, there has been concern that some global signal correction methods, such as global signal regression, may produce significant negative bias in the correlation values. In this paper we introduce a framework for visualizing the signal structure of resting-state fMRI data and characterizing the properties of the global signal. Using this framework, we demonstrate that a portion of the global signal can be viewed as an additive confound that increases with the mean BOLD amplitude. An approach for minimizing the contribution of this additive confound is presented, and an initial comparison with existing global signal correction methods is provided",

Stepping the infusion rate from 100 to 300 microg/kg/h after 2.5 h resulted in a prolonged period of approximately level sedation that cannot be achieved by a constant infusion of either 100 or 300 microg/kg/h. By stepping the infusion dosage, experiments as long as 6 h are possible. Functional MRI experiments were carried out on rats using a frequency dependent electrical stimulation protocol-namely, forepaw stimulation at 3, 5, 7, and 10 Hz. Each rat was studied for a four-hour period, divided into two equal portions. During the first portion, rats were started at a 100 microg/kg/h constant infusion. During the second portion, four secondary levels of infusion were used: 100, 150, 200, and 300 microg/kg/h. The fMRI response to stimulation frequency was used as an indirect measure of modulation of neuronal activity through pharmacological manipulation. The frequency response to stimulus was attenuated at the lower secondary infusion dosages 100 or 150 microg/kg/h but not at the higher secondary infusion dosages 200 or 300 microg/kg/h. Parallel experiments with the animal at rest were carried out using both electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) methods with consistent results. In the secondary infusion period using 300 microg/kg/h, resting-state functional connectivity is enhanced.",

    abstract = "Multiple sclerosis (MS), a variable and diffuse disease affecting white and gray matter, is known to cause functional connectivity anomalies in patients. However, related studies published to-date are post hoc; our hypothesis was that such alterations could discriminate between patients and healthy controls in a predictive setting, laying the groundwork for imaging-based prognosis. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data of 22 minimally disabled MS patients and 14 controls, we developed a predictive model of connectivity alterations in MS: a whole-brain connectivity matrix was built for each subject from the slow oscillations (<0.11Hz) of region-averaged time series, and a pattern recognition technique was used to learn a discriminant function indicating which particular functional connections are most affected by disease. Classification performance using strict cross-validation yielded a sensitivity of 82\% (above chance at p<0.005) and specificity of 86\% (p<0.01) to distinguish between MS patients and controls. The most discriminative connectivity changes were found in subcortical and temporal regions, and contralateral connections were more discriminative than ipsilateral connections. The pattern of decreased discriminative connections can be summarized post hoc in an index that correlates positively ($\rho$=0.61) with white matter lesion load, possibly indicating functional reorganisation to cope with increasing lesion load. These results are consistent with a subtle but widespread impact of lesions in white matter and in gray matter structures serving as high-level integrative hubs. These findings suggest that predictive models of resting state fMRI can reveal specific anomalies due to MS with high sensitivity and specificity, potentially leading to new non-invasive markers",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Recent fMRI studies have shown that it is possible to reliably identify the default-mode network (DMN) in the absence of any task, by resting-state connectivity analyses in healthy volunteers. We here aimed to identify the DMN in the challenging patient population of disorders of consciousness encountered following coma.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A spatial independent component analysis-based methodology permitted DMN assessment, decomposing connectivity in all its different sources either neuronal or artifactual. Three different selection criteria were introduced assessing anticorrelation-corrected connectivity with or without an automatic masking procedure and calculating connectivity scores encompassing both spatial and temporal properties. These three methods were validated on 10 healthy controls and applied to an independent group of 8 healthy controls and 11 severely brain-damaged patients [locked-in syndrome (n = 2), minimally conscious (n = 1), and vegetative state (n = 8)].PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: All vegetative patients showed fewer connections in the default-mode areas, when compared with controls, contrary to locked-in patients who showed near-normal connectivity. In the minimally conscious-state patient, only the two selection criteria considering both spatial and temporal properties were able to identify an intact right lateralized BOLD connectivity pattern, and metabolic PET data suggested its neuronal origin.CONCLUSIONS: When assessing resting-state connectivity in patients with disorders of consciousness, it is important to use a methodology excluding non-neuronal contributions caused by head motion, respiration, and heart rate artifacts encountered in all studied patients",

Most studies have focused on the examination of temporal correlation between resting state fMRI low-frequency oscillations (LFOs). Studies on the amplitudes of these low-frequency oscillations are rarely reported. Here, we used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF; the relative amplitude that resides in the low frequencies) to examine the amplitude of LFO in schizophrenia. Twenty-six healthy controls and 29 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated. Our findings show that patients showed reduced low-frequency amplitude in proportion to the total frequency band investigated (i.e., fALFF) in the lingual gyrus, left cuneus, left insula/superior temporal gyrus, and right caudate and increased fALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus. ALFF was reduced in patients in the lingual gyrus, cuneus, and precuneus and increased in the left parahippocampal gyrus. These results suggest LFO abnormalities in schizophrenia. The implication of these abnormalities for schizophrenic symptomatology is further discussed.",

    abstract = {The characterization of topological architecture of complex brain networks is one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience. Slow (<0.1 Hz), spontaneous fluctuations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging are thought to be potentially important for the reflection of spontaneous neuronal activity. Many studies have shown that these fluctuations are highly coherent within anatomically or functionally linked areas of the brain. However, the underlying topological mechanisms responsible for these coherent intrinsic or spontaneous fluctuations are still poorly understood. Here, we apply modern network analysis techniques to investigate how spontaneous neuronal activities in the human brain derived from the resting-state BOLD signals are topologically organized at both the temporal and spatial scales. We first show that the spontaneous brain functional networks have an intrinsically cohesive modular structure in which the connections between regions are much denser within modules than between them. These identified modules are found to be closely associated with several well known functionally interconnected subsystems such as the somatosensory/motor, auditory, attention, visual, subcortical, and the "default" system. Specifically, we demonstrate that the module-specific topological features can not be captured by means of computing the corresponding global network parameters, suggesting a unique organization within each module. Finally, we identify several pivotal network connectors and paths (predominantly associated with the association and limbic/paralimbic cortex regions) that are vital for the global coordination of information flow over the whole network, and we find that their lesions (deletions) critically affect the stability and robustness of the brain functional system. Together, our results demonstrate the highly organized modular architecture and associated topological properties in the temporal and spatial brain functional networks of the human brain that underlie spontaneous neuronal dynamics, which provides important implications for our understanding of how intrinsically coherent spontaneous brain activity has evolved into an optimal neuronal architecture to support global computation and information integration in the absence of specific stimuli or behaviors.},

    abstract = {Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the presence of a "default system" in the brain, which shows a "default mode of brain activity," i.e., greater activity during the resting state than during an attention-demanding cognitive task. The default system mainly involves the medial prefrontal and medial parietal areas, including the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. It has been proposed that this default activity is concerned with internal thought processes. Recently, it has been indicated that chimpanzees show high metabolic levels in these medial brain areas during rest. Correlated low-frequency spontaneous activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging was observed between the medial parietal and medial prefrontal areas in the anesthetized monkey. However, there have been few attempts to demonstrate a default system that shows task-induced deactivation in nonhuman primates. We conducted a positron emission tomography study with [(15)O]H(2)O to demonstrate a default mode of brain activity in the awake monkey sitting on a primate chair. Macaque monkeys showed higher level of regional blood flow in these medial brain areas as well as lateral and orbital prefrontal areas during rest compared with that under a working memory task, suggesting the existence of internal thought processes in the monkey. However, during rest in the monkey, the highest level of blood flow relative to that in other brain regions was observed not in the default system but in the dorsal striatum, suggesting that regions with the highest cerebral blood flow during rest may differ depending on the resting condition and/or species.},

    title = "{A shift to randomness of brain oscillations in people with autism.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables investigation of the intrinsic functional organization of the brain. Fractal parameters such as the Hurst exponent, H, describe the complexity of endogenous low-frequency fMRI time series on a continuum from random (H = .5) to ordered (H = 1). Shifts in fractal scaling of physiological time series have been associated with neurological and cardiac conditions. METHODS: Resting-state fMRI time series were recorded in 30 male adults with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) and 33 age- and IQ-matched male volunteers. The Hurst exponent was estimated in the wavelet domain and between-group differences were investigated at global and voxel level and in regions known to be involved in autism. RESULTS: Complex fractal scaling of fMRI time series was found in both groups but globally there was a significant shift to randomness in the ASC (mean H = .758, SD = .045) compared with neurotypical volunteers (mean H = .788, SD = .047). Between-group differences in H, which was always reduced in the ASC group, were seen in most regions previously reported to be involved in autism, including cortical midline structures, medial temporal structures, lateral temporal and parietal structures, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Severity of autistic symptoms was negatively correlated with H in retrosplenial and right anterior insular cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Autism is associated with a small but significant shift to randomness of endogenous brain oscillations. Complexity measures may provide physiological indicators for autism as they have done for other medical conditions.",

    title = {{The impact of "physiological correction" on functional connectivity analysis of pharmacological resting state fMRI.}},
    abstract = {Growing interest in pharmacological resting state fMRI (RSfMRI) necessitates developing standardized and robust analytical approaches that are insensitive to spurious correlated physiological signals. However, in pharmacological experiments physiological variations constitute an important aspect of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic profile of drug action; therefore retrospective corrective methods that discard physiological signals as noise may not be suitable. Previously, we have shown that template-based dual regression analysis is a sensitive method for model-free and objective detection of drug-specific effects on functional brain connectivity. In the current study, the robustness of this standard approach to physiological variations in a placebo controlled, repeated measures pharmacological RSfMRI study of morphine and alcohol in 12 healthy young men is tested. The impact of physiology-related variations on statistical inferences has been studied by: 1) modeling average physiological rates in higher level group analysis; 2) Regressing out the instantaneous respiration variation (RV); 3) applying retrospective image correction (RETROICOR) in the preprocessing stage; and 4) performing combined RV and heart rate correction (RVHRCOR) by regressing out physiological pulses convolved with canonical respiratory and cardiac hemodynamic response functions. Results indicate regional sensitivity of the BOLD signal to physiological variations, especially in the vicinity of large vessels, plus certain brain structures that are reported to be involved in physiological regulation, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, medial prefrontal and insular cortices, as well as the thalamus, cerebellum and the brainstem. The largest impact of "correction" on final statistical test outcomes resulted from including the average respiration frequency and heart rate in the higher-level group analysis. Overall, the template-based dual regression method seems robust against physical noise that is corrected by RV regression or RETROICOR. However, convolving the RV and HR with canonical hemodynamic response functions caused a notable change in the BOLD signal variance, and in resting state connectivity estimates. The impact of RVHRCOR on statistical tests was limited to elimination of both morphine and alcohol effects related to the somatosensory network that consists of insula and cingulate cortex-important structures for autonomic regulation. Although our data do not warrant speculations about neuronal or vascular origins of these effects, these observations raise caution about the implications of physiological 'noise' and the risks of introducing false positives (e.g. increased white matter connectivity) by using generalized physiological correction methods in pharmacological studies. The obvious sensitivity of the posterior part of the default mode network to different correction schemes, underlines the importance of controlling for physiological fluctuations in seed-based functional connectivity analyses},

Evidence also indicates altered activation in frontostriatal networks for cognitive control, particularly involving anterior cingulate cortex, and altered connectivity in the resting state and the default mode network. The findings suggest that the specialization of many cortical networks of the human brain has failed to develop fully in high functioning individuals with autism.SUMMARY: This research provides a growing specification of to the neurobiologic basis for this complex syndrome and for the co-occurrence of the signs and symptoms as a syndrome.

    abstract = "Purpose: To explore the neural correlates of the thalamus by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and to investigate whether thalamic resting-state networks (RSNs) are disrupted in patients with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from 24 patients with MTBI and 17 healthy control subjects. The patients had varying degrees of symptoms, with a mean disease duration of 22 days. The resting-state functional MR imaging data were analyzed by using a standard seed-based whole-brain correlation method to characterize thalamic RSNs. Student t tests were used to perform comparisons. The association between thalamic RSNs and performance on neuropsychologic and neurobehavioral measures was also investigated in patients with MTBI by using Spearman rank correlation. Results: A normal pattern of thalamic RSNs was demonstrated in healthy subjects. This pattern was characterized as representing relatively symmetric and restrictive functional thalamocortical connectivity, suggesting an inhibitory property of the thalamic neurons during the resting state. This pattern was disrupted, with significantly increased thalamic RSNs (P ≤ .005) and decreased symmetry (P = .03) in patients with MTBI compared with healthy control subjects. Increased functional thalamocortical redistributive connectivity was correlated with diminished neurocognitive functions and clinical symptoms in patients with MTBI. Conclusion: These findings of abnormal thalamic RSNs lend further support to the presumed subtle thalamic injury in patients with MTBI. Resting-state functional MR imaging can be used as an additional imaging modality for detection of thalamocortical connectivity abnormalities and for better understanding of the complex persistent postconcussive syndrome. © RSNA, 2011.",

Forty-eight patients with aMCI and 36 well-matched normal controls were assessed by a comprehensive battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. In addition, regional homogeneity (ReHo) approaches were used to analyze blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data on the resting state in all subjects, and genotyping of the serum ACE was measured in aMCI patients. The D carriers with aMCI patients were found to have markedly higher serum ACE levels than I homozygote carriers. Importantly, compared with the carried I homozygote group of patients with aMCI, the D carriers of aMCI patients were significantly impaired in the AVLT-delayed recall and had decreased ReHo over the bilateral precuneus, left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior parietal lobe, and right angular gyrus, whilst increased ReHo was found mainly in the left medial frontal gyrus, right paracentral lobe, and right anterior cingulate cortex. The findings indicated that ACE genotype was associated with episodic memory, serum levels of ACE, and resting-state brain activity in aMCI patients, and the findings of cognitive function and brain activity further suggests that the ACE D allele may have a specific role in semantic memory dysfunction and brain activity in aMCI.",

    abstract = "Recent EEG-fMRI studies have shown that different stages of sleep are associated with changes both in brain activity and functional connectivity. These results raise the concern that lack of vigilance measures in resting state experiments may introduce confounds and contamination due to subjects falling asleep inside the scanner. In this study we present a method to perform automatic sleep staging using only fMRI functional connectivity data, thus providing vigilance information while circumventing the technical demands of simultaneous recording of EEG, the gold standard for sleep scoring. The features to classify are the linear correlation values between 20 cortical regions identified using independent component analysis and two regions in the bilateral thalamus. The method is based on the construction of binary support vector machine classifiers discriminating between all pairs of sleep stages and the subsequent combination of them into multiclass classifiers. Different multiclass schemes and kernels are explored. After parameter optimization through 5-fold cross validation we achieve accuracies over 0.8 in the binary problem with functional connectivities obtained for epochs as short as 60s. The multiclass classifier generalizes well to two independent datasets (accuracies over 0.8 in both sets) and can be efficiently applied to any dataset using a sliding window procedure. Modelling vigilance states in resting state analysis will avoid confounded inferences and facilitate the study of vigilance states themselves. We thus consider the method introduced in this study a novel and practical contribution for monitoring vigilance levels inside an MRI scanner without need of extra recordings other than fMRI BOLD signals",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) impairs signal transmission along cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections, affecting functional integration within the motor network. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during motor tasks has revealed altered functional connectivity in MS, but it is unclear how much motor disability contributed to these abnormal functional interaction patterns. OBJECTIVE: To avoid any influence of impaired task performance, we examined disease-related changes in functional motor connectivity in MS at rest. METHODS: A total of 42 patients with MS and 30 matched controls underwent a 20-minute resting-state fMRI session at 3 Tesla. Independent component analysis was applied to the fMRI data to identify disease-related changes in motor resting-state connectivity. RESULTS: Patients with MS showed a spatial expansion of motor resting-state connectivity in deep subcortical nuclei but not at the cortical level. The anterior and middle parts of the putamen, adjacent globus pallidus, anterior and posterior thalamus and the subthalamic region showed stronger functional connectivity with the motor network in the MS group compared with controls. CONCLUSION: MS is characterised by more widespread motor connectivity in the basal ganglia while cortical motor resting-state connectivity is preserved. The expansion of subcortical motor resting-state connectivity in MS indicates less efficient funnelling of neural processing in the executive motor cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops",

    title = "{Global Functional Connectivity Abnormalities in Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies, including those employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have revealed significant disturbances in the white matter of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Both macrostructural and microstructural abnormalities have been observed across levels of FASD severity. Emerging evidence suggests that these white matter abnormalities are associated with functional deficits. This study used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate the status of network functional connectivity in children with FASD compared with control subjects. METHODS: Participants included 24 children with FASD, ages 10 to 17, and 31 matched controls. Neurocognitive tests were administered including Wechsler Intelligence Scales, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning. High-resolution anatomical MRI data and 6-minute resting-state fMRI data were collected. The resting-state fMRI data were subjected to a graph theory analysis, and 4 global measures of cortical network connectivity were computed: characteristic path length, mean clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and global efficiency. RESULTS: Results revealed significantly altered network connectivity in those with FASD. The characteristic path length was 3.1\% higher (p = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.47), and global efficiency was 1.9\% lower (p = 0.04, d = 0.63) in children with FASD compared with controls, suggesting decreased network capacity that may have implications for integrative cognitive functioning. Global efficiency was significantly positively correlated with cortical thickness in frontal (r = 0.38, p = 0.005), temporal (r = 0.28, p = 0.043), and parietal (r = 0.36, p = 0.008) regions. No relationship between facial dysmorphology and functional connectivity was observed. Exploratory correlations suggested that global efficiency and characteristic path length are associated with capacity for immediate verbal memory on the CVLT (r = 0.41, p = 0.05 and r = 0.41, p = 0.01, respectively) among those with FASD. CONCLUSIONS: Resting-state functional connectivity measures provide new insight into the integrity of brain networks in clinical populations such as FASD. Results demonstrate that children with FASD have alterations in core components of network function and that these aspects of brain integrity are related to measures of structure and cognitive functioning",

Spatially constrained hierarchical clustering is then used to further combine these regions in a hierarchical tree.

    abstract = "The brain shows a high degree of activity at rest. The significance of this activity has come increasingly into focus. At present, however, the interaction between this activity and stimulus-induced activity is not well defined. The interaction between a task-negative (perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, pgACC) and task-positive (supragenual anterior cingulate cortex, sgACC) region during a simple task was thus investigated using a combination of fMRI and MRS. Negative BOLD responses in the pgACC were found to show a unidirectional effective connectivity with task-induced positive BOLD responses in the sgACC. This connectivity was shown to be related specifically with glutamate levels in the pgACC. These results demonstrate an interaction between deactivation from resting-state and resting-state glutamate levels in a task-negative region (pgACC), and task-induced activity in a task-positive region (sgACC). This provides insight into the neuronal and biochemical mechanisms by means of which the resting state activity of the brain potentially impacts upon subsequent stimulus-induced activity.

    abstract = "The default mode network (DMN) has been previously identified as a set of brain regions activated during internally directed cognition. The objective of this study was to investigate patterns of brain activation during switching between a goal-directed task and a rest period obtained from clinical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms in complex partial seizures (CPS) and age-matched controls. As part of pre-surgical evaluation with fMRI, a visually presented block-design language task was performed by eight subjects (4 CPS, 4 age-matched controls). Single subject fMRI maps were calculated and transferred into Talairach space for an atlas-based analysis. For the rest state, total volumes of activation, brain regions with largest volume of activation and regions commonly activated in the CPS and the control group were identified. A voxel-by-voxel comparison was conducted to reveal inter-group statistically significant differences. Average volume of activation in the CPS group was significantly higher (32,080 mm(3)) than in the control group (7,915 mm(3), p-value 〈 0.03). In both groups, most of the common activation volume (81\% in the CPS group and 98 \% in the control group) was located in cognitive regions of the frontal lobe and temporal lobes as well as anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and cuneus. The remaining 19\% in the CPS group included regions in the precentral gyrus, the superior and medial occipital gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule and the angular gyrus. The voxel-by-voxel comparison showed larger areas of activation mostly in the frontal and temporal lobes in the CPS group (as well as in the cuneus and precuneus), while regions with larger activation in the control group were found mostly in the parietal lobe. Our findings implicate that switching from goal-directed behavior to the default mode in CPS patients is impaired. Information contained in clinical fMRI block-design image data can be used to quantify this impairment.",

We found that the medial Heschl's gyrus was strongly coupled, in particular, to visual cortex along the anterior banks of the calcarine fissure. This observation was confirmed using novel group-level, tensor-based independent components analysis. fcMRI analysis revealed that although overall coupling between the auditory and visual cortex was significantly reduced when subjects performed a visual perception task, coupling between the anterior calcarine cortex and auditory cortex was not disrupted. These results suggest that primary auditory cortex has a functionally distinct relationship with the anterior visual cortex, which is known to represent the peripheral visual field.

In addition to increasing our knowledge of normal brain connectivity, disruptions of the spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations have been suggested as possible diagnostic indicators of neurological and psychiatric disease states. Though the non-invasive technique has been received with much acclamation, open questions remain regarding the origin, organization, phylogenesis, as well as the basis of disease-related alterations underlying the signal patterns. Experimental work utilizing animal models, including the use of neurophysiological recordings and pharmacological manipulations, therefore, represents a critical component in the understanding and successful application of resting-state analysis, as it affords a range of experimental manipulations not possible in human subjects. In this article, we review recent rodent and non-human primate studies and based on the examination of the homologous brain architecture propose the latter to be the best-suited model for exploring these unresolved resting-state concerns. Ongoing work examining the correspondence of functional and structural connectivity, state-dependency and the neuronal correlates of the hemodynamic oscillations are discussed. We then consider the potential experiments that will allow insight into different brain states and disease-related network disruptions that can extend the clinical applications of resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI)",

Using a publicly available resting state dataset (n = 961 subjects), we obtained high spatial-resolution maps of functional connectivity between a lattice of 7266 regions covering the gray matter. Average whole brain functional correlations were calculated, with high reproducibility within the dataset and across sites. Since correlation measures not only represent pairwise connectivity information, but also shared inputs from other brain regions, we approximate pairwise connection strength by representing each region as a linear combination of the others by performing a Cholesky decomposition of the pairwise correlation matrix. We then used this weighted connection strength between regions to iterate relative brain activity in discrete temporal steps, beginning both with random initial conditions, and with initial conditions reflecting intrinsic connectivity networks using each region as a seed. In whole brain simulations based on weighted connectivity from healthy adult subjects (mean age 27.3), there was consistent convergence to one of two inverted states, one representing high activity in the default mode network, the other representing low relative activity in the default mode network. Metastable intermediate states in our simulation corresponded to combinations of characterized functional networks. Convergence to a final state was slowest for initial conditions on the borders of the default mode network",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: In recent years, neuroimaging has been increasingly used as an objective method for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most previous studies were based on invasive imaging modalities or on a single modality which was not an ideal diagnostic tool. In this study, we developed a non-invasive technology intended for use in the diagnosis of early PD by integrating the advantages of various modals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen early PD patients and twenty-seven normal volunteers participated in this study. For each subject, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and structural images. For the rsfMRI images, we extracted the characteristics at three different levels: ALFF (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations), ReHo (regional homogeneity) and RFCS (regional functional connectivity strength). For the structural images, we extracted the volume characteristics from the gray matter (GM), the white matter (WM) and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A two-sample t-test was used for the feature selection, and then the remaining features were fused for classification. Finally a classifier for early PD patients and normal control subjects was identified from support vector machine training. The performance of the classifier was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. RESULTS: Using the proposed methods to classify the data set, good results (accuracy = 86.96\%, sensitivity = 78.95\%, specificity = 92.59\%) were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: This method demonstrates a promising diagnosis performance by the integration of information from a variety of imaging modalities, and it shows potential for improving the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PD",

    abstract = "Previous studies using simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings have yielded discrepant results regarding the topography of brain activity in relation to spontaneous power fluctuations in the alpha band of the EEG during eyes-closed rest. Here, we explore several possible explanations for this discrepancy by re-analyzing in detail our previously reported data. Using single subject analyses as a starting point, we found that alpha power decreases are associated with fMRI signal increases that mostly follow two distinct patterns: either 'visual' areas in the occipital lobe or 'attentional' areas in the frontal and parietal lobe. On examination of the EEG spectra corresponding to these two fMRI patterns, we found greater relative theta power in sessions yielding the 'visual' fMRI pattern during alpha desynchronization and greater relative beta power in sessions yielding the 'attentional' fMRI pattern. The few sessions that fell into neither pattern featured the overall lowest theta and highest beta power. We conclude that the pattern of brain activation observed during spontaneous power reduction in the alpha band depends on the general level of brain activity as indexed over a broader spectral range in the EEG. Finally, we relate these findings to the concepts of 'resting state' and 'default mode' and discuss how - as for sleep - EEG-based criteria might be used for staging brain activity during wakefulness.",

    abstract = "Buprenorphine (BUP) is a partial agonist at $\mu$-, $\delta$- and ORL1 (opioid receptor-like)/nociceptin receptors and antagonist at the $\kappa$-opioid receptor site. BUP is known to have both analgesic as well as antihyperalgesic effects via its central activity, and is used in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain conditions. Recently, it was shown that intravenous (IV) administration of 0.2mg/70 kg BUP modulates the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to acute noxious stimuli in healthy human subjects. The present study extends these observations by investigating the effects of BUP dose and route of administration on central nervous system (CNS) pain circuitry. Specifically, the modulation of evoked pain BOLD responses and resting state functional connectivity was measured following IV (0.1 and 0.2mg/70 kg) and sublingual (SL) (2mg) BUP administration in healthy human subjects. While 0.1mg/70 kg IV BUP is sub-analgesic, both 0.2mg/70 kg IV BUP and 2.0mg SL BUP are analgesic doses of the drug. Evoked BOLD responses were clearly modulated in a dose-dependent manner. The analgesic doses of BUP by both routes of administration yielded a potentiation in limbic/mesolimbic circuitry and attenuation in sensorimotor/sensory-discriminative circuitry. In addition, robust decreases in functional connectivity between the putamen and the sensorimotor/sensory-discriminative structures were observed at the two analgesic doses subsequent to measuring the maximum plasma BUP concentrations (C(max)). The decreases in functional connectivity within the sensorimotor/sensory-discriminative circuitry were also observed to be dose-dependent in the IV administration cohorts. These reproducible and consistent functional CNS measures at clinically effective doses of BUP demonstrate the potential of evoked pain fMRI and resting-state functional connectivity as objective tools that can inform the process of dose selection. Such methods may be useful during early clinical phase evaluation of potential analgesics in drug development",

In this study, we propose an approach for evaluating FNC and apply it to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We examined the connectivity and latency among ICA component time courses to test the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia would show increased functional connectivity and increased lag among resting state networks compared to controls. Resting state fMRI data were collected and the inter-relationships among seven selected resting state networks (identified using group ICA) were evaluated by correlating each subject's ICA time courses with one another. Patients showed higher correlation than controls among most of the dominant resting state networks. Patients also had slightly more variability in functional connectivity than controls. We present a novel approach for quantifying functional connectivity among brain networks identified with spatial ICA. Significant differences between patient and control connectivity in different networks were revealed possibly reflecting deficiencies in cortical processing in patients.",

Spontaneous activity (i.e., resting state) refers to activity that cannot be attributed to specific inputs or outputs, that is, activity intrinsically generated by the brain.METHOD: This article presents pilot data examining neural connectivity in patients with poststroke hemiparesis before and after 3 weeks of upper extremity rehabilitation in the Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP). Resting-state fMRI data acquired pre and post therapy were analyzed using an exploratory adaptation of structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate therapy-related changes in motor network effective connectivity.RESULTS: Each ASAP patient showed behavioral improvement. ASAP patients also showed increased influence of the affected hemisphere premotor cortex (a-PM) upon the unaffected hemisphere premotor cortex (u-PM) following therapy. The influence of a-PM on affected hemisphere primary motor cortex (a-M1) also increased with therapy for 3 of 5 patients, including those with greatest behavioral improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that network analyses of resting-state fMRI constitute promising tools for functional characterization of functional brain disorders, for intergroup comparisons, and potentially for assessing effective connectivity within single subjects; all of which have important implications for stroke rehabilitation",

    abstract = "Neurobiological and neuroimaging studies have emphasized the structural and functional alterations in the striatum of cirrhotic patients, but alterations in the functional connections between the striatum and other brain regions have not yet been explored. Of note, manganese accumulation in the nervous system, frequently reflected by hyperintensity at the bilateral globus pallidus (GP) on T1-weighted imaging, has been considered a factor affecting the striatal and cortical functions in hepatic decompensation. We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the temporal correlation between the striatum and the remaining brain regions using seed-based correlation analyses. The two-sample t-test was conducted to detect the differences in corticostriatal connectivity between 44 cirrhotic patients with hyperintensity at the bilateral GP and 20 healthy controls. Decreased connectivity of the caudate was detected in the anterior/middle cingulate gyrus, and increased connectivity of the caudate was found in the left motor cortex. A reduction in functional connectivity was found between the putamen and several regions, including the anterior cingulate gyrus, right insular lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior lobe of the right cerebellum; increased connectivity was detected between the putamen and right middle temporal gyrus. There were significant correlations between the corticostriatal connectivity and neuropsychological performances in the patient group, but not between the striatal connectivity and GP signal intensity. These alterations in the corticostriatal functional connectivity suggested the abnormalities in the intrinsic brain functional organiztion among the cirrhotic patients with manganese deposition, and may be associated with development of metabolic encephalopathy. The manganese deposition in nervous system, however, can not be an independent factor predicting the resting-state brain dysfunction in real time",

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is an emerging functional neuroimaging technique with the advantages, relative to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), of portability and the ability to simultaneously measure both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. Previous optical studies have evaluated the temporal features of spontaneous resting brain signals. Herein, we develop techniques for spatially mapping functional connectivity with DOT (fc-DOT). Simultaneous imaging over the motor and visual cortices yielded robust correlation maps reproducing the expected functional neural architecture. The localization of the maps was confirmed with task-response studies and with subject-matched fc-MRI. These fc-DOT methods provide a task-less approach to mapping brain function in populations that were previously difficult to research. Our advances may permit new studies of early childhood development and of unconscious patients. In addition, the comprehensive hemoglobin contrasts of fc-DOT enable innovative studies of the biophysical origin of the functional connectivity signal.",

Previously, we identified regions that carried signals related to task-control initiation, maintenance, and adjustment.

In contrast to previous, more unitary models of control, this approach suggests the presence of two distinct task-control networks. A frontoparietal network included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus. This network emphasized start-cue and error-related activity and may initiate and adapt control on a trial-by-trial basis. The second network included dorsal anterior cingulate/medial superior frontal cortex, anterior insula/frontal operculum, and anterior prefrontal cortex. Among other signals, these regions showed activity sustained across the entire task epoch, suggesting that this network may control goal-directed behavior through the stable maintenance of task sets. These two independent networks appear to operate on different time scales and affect downstream processing via dissociable mechanisms.",

In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting speech perception areas has been advanced as a potential treatment of medication-resistant hallucinations. However, the underlying neural processes remain unclear. This study aimed to assess whether 1 Hz rTMS treatment would affect functional connectivity of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Resting state fMRI scans were obtained from 18 patients with schizophrenia. Patients were assessed before and after a 6 day treatment with 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ, or placebo treatment with sham rTMS to the same location. We assessed functional connectivity between a priori defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) comprising the putative AVH network and the bilateral TPJ seed regions, targeted with rTMS. Symptom improvement following rTMS treatment was observed in the left rTMS group, whereas no change at occurred in the placebo group. Although no corresponding changes were observed in the functional connections previously found to be associated with AVH severity, an increase in connectivity between the left TPJ and the right insula was observed in group receiving rTMS to the left TPJ. The placebo group conversely showed a decrease in connectivity between the left TPJ and left anterior cingulate. We conclude that application of 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ region may affect functional connectivity of the targeted region. However, the relationship between these functional changes during the resting state and the rate of clinical improvement needs further clarification.",

Moreover, Mild Cognitive Impairment refers to the presence of cognitive impairments that is not severe enough to meet the criteria of Alzheimer's, and its diagnosis in early stages is so critical. There is currently no distinct method available for diagnosing Alzheimer's or Mild Cognitive Impairment, and their diagnosis needs a combination of different methods and assessments. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in differentiating between Alzheimer's, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy aging. To prove fMRI's ability, resting-state brain activation patterns between these three groups of subjects were compared using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm. Forty age- and sex-matched subjects, 15 elderly, 11 MCI and 14 Alzheimer's subjects were examined. RESULTS: The results showed that during a certain resting-state session, healthy aging brain benefits from larger area and greater intensity of activation (compared with MCI and Alzheimer's group) in Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) region of the brain, as part of Default Mode Network. CONCLUSIONS: This difference in activation pattern can be used as a diagnostic criterion in using fMRI for differentiating between Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MCI and healthy aging.",

The cognitive division of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC-cd) is a commonly reported abnormal brain region in schizophrenia for its importance in cognitive control process. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional and anatomical connectivity of ACC-cd and its cognitive and clinical manifestation significance in schizophrenia by using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).METHODS: Thirty-three medicated schizophrenics and 30 well-matched health controls were recruited. Region-of-interest (ROI)-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were performed on 30 patients and 30 controls, and 24 patients and 29 controls, respectively. The Pearson correlation was performed between the imaging measures and the Stroop performance and scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively.RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly abnormal in the functional connectivity and its hemispheric asymmetry of the ACC-cd with multiple brain areas, e.g., decreased positive connectivity with the bilateral putamen and caudate, increased negative connectivity with the left posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), increased asymmetry of connectivity strength with the contralateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The FA of the right anterior cingulum was significantly decreased in patients group (p = 0.014). The abnormal functional and structural connectivity of ACC-cd were correlated with Stroop performance and the severity of the symptoms in patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the abnormal connectivity of the ACC-cd might play a role in the cognitive impairment and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia",

Most current approaches to the analysis of fMRI data assume simple models for temporal (short term or long term) dependence structure. Such simplifications are to some extent necessary due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of the data, but to date there have been few systematic studies of the dependence structures under a range of possible null hypotheses, using data sets gathered specifically for that purpose. We aim to address some of these issues by analyzing the detrended data with a long enough time horizon to study possible long-range temporal dependence. Our multiscale approach shows that even for resting-state data, data, i.e. "null" or ambient thought, some voxel time series cannot be modeled by white noise and need long-range dependent type error structure. This finding suggests the use of different time series models in different parts of the brain in fMRI studies.},

    abstract = "Social anxiety disorder patients suffer from excessive anxious responses in social interaction leading to avoidance behavior and social impairment. Although the amygdala has a central role in perception and processing of threatening cues, little is known about the involved networks and corresponding dysfunctions in social anxiety. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the functional connectivity network of the amygdala in patients with social anxiety disorder and to identify regions that might influence amygdalar reactivity via modulatory pathways.Ten patients with anxiety disorders (social and/or panic) and 27 healthy controls underwent a facial emotion processing task as well as 6-min functional MRI at resting state. Individual voxel-wise functional connectivity maps were calculated using the amygdala as seed region. Group comparisons were done by random-effects analysis in SPM.Patients exhibited an amygdala hyperactivation during the emotional task and decreased functional coupling of the left amygdala with the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. The strength of this functional connectivity showed a negative association with the severity of state anxiety. In addition, an exploratory analysis revealed further reduced functional connectivity and a marked functional separation between the medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in the patient group.Our results suggest alterations within the amygdalar functional connectivity network in social anxiety disorder. Combined with the amygdalar hyperactivation our findings corroborate the proposed dysfunction of the fronto-amygdalar inhibition in anxiety disorders and indicate a modulatory influence of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices on threat perception and processing. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Although alterations in its resting state activity and in its recruitment during tasks have been reported for several mental and neurodegenerative disorders, its role in emotion processing has received relatively little attention. We investigated brain responses to different categories of emotional faces with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found deactivation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), posterior cingulate gyrus (PC) and cuneus. This deactivation was modulated by emotional category and was less prominent for happy than for sad faces. These deactivated areas along the midline conformed to areas of the DMN. We also observed emotion-dependent deactivation of the left middle frontal gyrus, which is not a classical component of the DMN. Conversely, several areas in a fronto-parietal network commonly linked with attention were differentially activated by emotion categories. Functional connectivity patterns, as obtained by correlation of activation levels, also varied between emotions. VMPFC, PC or cuneus served as hubs between the DMN-type areas and the fronto-parietal network. These data support recent suggestions that the DMN is not a unitary system but differentiates according to task and even type of stimulus. The emotion-specific differential pattern of DMN deactivation may be explored further in patients with mood disorder, where the quest for biological markers of emotional biases is still ongoing",

    abstract = "Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RS-FMRI) holds the promise of revealing brain functional connectivity without requiring specific tasks targeting particular brain systems. RS-FMRI is being used to find differences between populations even when a specific candidate target for traditional inferences is lacking. However, the problem with RS-FMRI is a lacking definition of what constitutes noise and signal. RS- FMRI is easy to acquire but not to analyze or draw inferences from. In this commentary we discuss a problem that is still treated lightly despite its significant impact on RS-FMRI inferences: Global Signal Regression (GSReg) - the practice of projecting out signal averaged over the entire brain - can change resting state correlations in ways that dramatically alter correlation patterns and hence conclusions about brain functional connectedness. Although Murphy et al. in 2009 demonstrated GSReg negatively biases correlations, the approach remains in wide use. We revisit this issue to argue the problem with GSReg is more than negative bias or the interpretability of negative correlations. Its usage can fundamentally alter inter-regional correlations within a group, or their differences between groups. We used an illustrative model to clearly convey our objections and derived equations formalizing our conclusions. We hope this creates a clear context in which counterarguments can be made. We conclude that GSReg should not be used when studying RS-FMRI because GSReg biases correlations differently in different regions depending on the underlying true inter-regional correlation structure. GSReg can alter local and long-range correlations, potentially spreading underlying group differences to regions that may never have had any. Conclusions also apply to substitutions of GSReg for denoising with decompositions of signals aggregated over the network's regions to the extent they cannot separate signals of interest from noise. We touch on the need for careful accounting of nuisance parameters when making group comparisons of correlation maps",

A variety of methods have been developed to cluster fibers based on various types of features such as geometry, anatomy, connection, or function. However, identification of group-wise consistent fiber bundles that are harmonious across multi-modalities is rarely explored yet. This paper proposes a novel hybrid two-stage approach that incorporates connectional and functional features, and identifies group-wise consistent fiber bundles across subjects. In the first stage, based on our recently developed 358 dense and consistent cortical landmarks, we identified consistent backbone bundles with representative fibers. In the second stage, other remaining fibers are then classified into the existing backbone bundles using their correlations of resting state fMRI signals at the two ends of fibers. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods can achieve group-wise consistent fiber bundles with similar shapes and anatomic profiles, as well as strong functional coherences",

    abstract = "We calculated voxel-by-voxel pairwise crosscorrelations between prewhitened resting-state BOLD fMRI time series recorded from 60 cortical areas (30 per hemisphere) in 18 human subjects (nine women and nine men). Altogether, more than a billion-and-a-quarter pairs of BOLD time series were analyzed. For each pair, a crosscorrelogram was computed by calculating 21 crosscorrelations, namely at zero lag ± 10 lags of 2 s duration each. For each crosscorrelogram, in turn, the crosscorrelation with the highest absolute value was found and its sign, value, and lag were retained for further analysis. In addition, the crosscorrelations at zero lag (irrespective of the location of the peak) were also analyzed as a special case. Based on known varying density of anatomical connectivity, we distinguished four general brain groups for which we derived summary statistics of crosscorrelations between voxels within an area (group I), between voxels of paired homotopic areas across the two hemispheres (group II), between voxels of an area and all other voxels in the same (ipsilateral) hemisphere (group III), and voxels of an area and all voxels in the opposite (contralateral) hemisphere (except those in the homotopic area) (group IV). We found the following. (a) Most of the crosscorrelogram peaks occurred at zero lag, followed by ±1 lag; (b) over all groups, positive crosscorrelations were much more frequent than negative ones; (c) average crosscorrelation was highest for group I, and decreased progressively for groups II-IV; (d) the ratio of positive over negative crosscorrelations was highest for group I and progressively smaller for groups II-IV; (e) the highest proportion of positive crosscorrelations (with respect to all positive ones) was observed at zero lag; and (f) the highest proportion of negative crosscorrelations (with respect to all negative ones) was observed at lag = 2. These findings reveal a systematic pattern of crosscorrelations with respect to their sign, magnitude, lag and brain group, as defined above. Given that these groups were defined along a qualitative gradient of known overall anatomical connectivity, our results suggest that functional interactions between two voxels may simply reflect the density of such anatomical connectivity between the areas to which the voxels belong.",

    abstract = "Aging is associated with changes in human brain anatomy and function and cognitive decline. Recent studies suggest the aging decline of major functional connectivity hubs in the default-mode network (DMN). Aging effects on other networks, however, are largely unknown. We hypothesized that aging would be associated with a decline of short-and long-range functional connectivity density (FCD) hubs in the DMN. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated resting-state data sets corresponding to 913 healthy subjects from a public magnetic resonance imaging database using functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM), a voxelwise and data-driven approach, together with parallel computing. Aging was associated with pronounced long-range FCD decreases in DMN and dorsal attention network (DAN) and with increases in somatosensory and subcortical networks. Aging effects in these networks were stronger for long-range than for short-range FCD and were also detected at the level of the main functional hubs. Females had higher short-and long-range FCD in DMN and lower FCD in the somatosensory network than males, but the gender by age interaction effects were not significant for any of the networks or hubs. These findings suggest that long-range connections may be more vulnerable to aging effects than short-range connections and that, in addition to the DMN, the DAN is also sensitive to aging effects, which could underlie the deterioration of attention processes that occurs with aging. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have shown that major depressive disorder (MDD) is accompanied by structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain regions and connections; yet, little is known about alterations of the topological organization of whole-brain networks in MDD patients.METHODS: Thirty drug-naive, first-episode MDD patients and 63 healthy control subjects underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. The whole-brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding partial correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and their topological properties (e.g., small-world, efficiency, and nodal centrality) were analyzed using graph theory-based approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were further used for group comparisons of topological metrics.RESULTS: Both the MDD and control groups showed small-world architecture in brain functional networks, suggesting a balance between functional segregation and integration. However, compared with control subjects, the MDD patients showed altered quantitative values in the global properties, characterized by lower path length and higher global efficiency, implying a shift toward randomization in their brain networks. The MDD patients exhibited increased nodal centralities, predominately in the caudate nucleus and default-mode regions, including the hippocampus, inferior parietal, medial frontal, and parietal regions, and reduced nodal centralities in the occipital, frontal (orbital part), and temporal regions. The altered nodal centralities in the left hippocampus and the left caudate nucleus were correlated with disease duration and severity.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that depressive disorder is associated with disruptions in the topological organization of functional brain networks and that this disruption may contribute to disturbances in mood and cognition in MDD patients.",

    abstract = "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; \$67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by \beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, \beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants",

By combining a two-level feature identification scheme with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLD), we achieve high classification rates in discriminating healthy controls from patients with schizophrenia. Experimental results using leave-one-out cross-validation show that features extracted from the default mode network (DMN) lead to a classification accuracy of over 90\% in both data sets. Moreover, using a majority vote method that uses multiple features, we achieve a classification accuracy of 98\% in auditory oddball (AOD) task and 93\% in rest data. Several components, including DMN, temporal, and medial visual regions, are consistently present in the set of features that yield high classification accuracy. The features we have extracted thus show promise to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia. Results also suggest that there may be different advantages to using resting fMRI data or task fMRI data",

The recently emerged resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) technique, capable of delineating brain's functional interaction pattern among distributed brain areas, proves to be a unique and powerful tool to study sedation-induced brain reorganization. Based on a relatively large school-aged children population (n=28, 10.3 ± 2.6 years, range from 7 to 15 years) and leveraging rsfMRI and graph theoretical analysis, this study aims to delineate sedation-induced changes in brain's information transferring property from a whole brain system perspective. Our results show a global deterioration in brain's efficiency properties (P = 0.0085 and 0.0018, for global and local efficiency, respectively) with a locally graded distribution featuring significant disruptions of key consciousness-related regions. Moreover, our results also indicate a redistribution of brain's information processing hubs characterized by a right and posterior shift as consistent with the reduced level of consciousness during sedation. Overall, our findings inform a sedation-induced functional reorganization pattern in school-aged children which greatly improve our understanding of sedation's effect in children and may potentially serve as reference for future sedation-related experimental studies and clinical applications",

Most prior developmental studies focused on functional connectivity between brain regions important for cognitive or emotional control and the so-called "default-mode network." In the present study, we investigated whole-brain functional connectivity in children (11-13 years; N = 19) and young adults (19-25 years; N = 29), without a priori restrictions to specific regions. We found similar patterns of functionally connected regions in children and young adults, but there were differences in the size of functionally connected regions (i.e., the number of voxels), as well as in the strength of functional connectivity (i.e., the correlation value) between brain regions. This indicates that functional connectivity continues to change during adolescence. Developmental differences were found across the whole brain, but the effects differed for functional connectivity patterns associated with higher cognitive or emotional functions and functional connectivity patterns associated with basic visual and sensorimotor functions. Finally, we showed that the majority of functional connectivity differences could not be explained on the basis of gray matter density alone. © 2010 The Author.},

How genes support this addictive and high-risk behavior through their expression in the brain remains poorly understood. Here we show that a key alpha5 gene variant Asp398Asn is associated with a dorsal anterior cingulate-ventral striatum/extended amygdala circuit, such that the "risk allele" decreases the intrinsic resting functional connectivity strength in this circuit. Importantly, this effect is observed independently in nonsmokers and smokers, although the circuit strength distinguishes smokers from nonsmokers, predicts addiction severity in smokers, and is not secondary to smoking per se, thus representing a trait-like circuitry biomarker. This same circuit is further impaired in people with mental illnesses, who have the highest rate of smoking. Identifying where and how brain circuits link genes to smoking provides practical neural circuitry targets for new treatment development},

The experience is one of rocking dizziness similar to when the individual was originally on the motion trigger such as a boat or airplane. MdDS represents a prolonged version of a normal phenomenon familiar to most individuals but which persists for months or years in others. It represents a natural example of the neuroplasticity of motion adaptation. However, the localization of where that motion adaptation occurs is unknown. Our goal was to localize metabolic and functional connectivity changes associated with persistent MdDS.METHODS: Twenty subjects with MdDS lasting a median duration of 17.5 months were compared to 20 normal controls with (18)F FDG PET and resting state fMRI. Resting state metabolism and functional connectivity were calculated using age, grey matter volume, and mood and anxiety scores as nuisance covariates.RESULTS: MdDS subjects showed increased metabolism in the left entorhinal cortex and amygdala (z>3.3). Areas of relative hypometabolism included the left superior medial gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right amygdala, right insula, and clusters in the left superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. MdDS subjects showed increased connectivity between the entorhinal cortex/amygdala cluster and posterior visual and vestibular processing areas including middle temporal gyrus, motion sensitive area MT/V5, superior parietal lobule, and primary visual cortex, while showing decreased connectivity to multiple prefrontal areas.CONCLUSION: These data show an association between resting state metabolic activity and functional connectivity between the entorhinal cortex and amygdala in a human disorder of abnormal motion perception. We propose a model for how these biological substrates can allow a limited period of motion exposure to lead to chronic perceptions of self-motion",

Reduced levels of self-referential processing have been proposed as a mechanism underlying poor insight. The default mode network (DMN) has been implicated as a key node in the circuit for self-referential processing. We hypothesized that during resting state the DMN network would show decreased connectivity in schizophrenia patients with poor insight compared to patients with good insight. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited from mental health care centers in the north of the Netherlands and categorized in groups having good insight (n = 25) or poor insight (n = 19). All subjects underwent a resting state fMRI scan. A healthy control group (n = 30) was used as a reference. Functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior part of the DMN, identified using Independent Component Analysis, was compared between groups. Patients with poor insight showed lower connectivity of the ACC within the anterior DMN component and precuneus within the posterior DMN component compared to patients with good insight. Connectivity between the anterior and posterior part of the DMN was lower in patients than controls, and qualitatively different between the good and poor insight patient groups. As predicted, subjects with poor insight in psychosis showed decreased connectivity in DMN regions implicated in self-referential processing, although this concerned only part of the network. This finding is compatible with theories implying a role of reduced self-referential processing as a mechanism contributing to poor insight",

Nine human subjects during resting state were imaged using single-shot gradient echo planar imaging on a 1.5T scanner. Eigenvalue spectra for the covariance matrix, correlation dimensions and Spatiotemporal Lyapunov Exponents were calculated to detect the spatiotemporal nonlinearity in resting-state fMRI data. By simulating, adjusting, and comparing the eigenvalue spectra of pure correlated noise with the corresponding real fMRI data, the intrinsic dimensionality was estimated. The intrinsic dimensionality was used to extract the first few principal components from the real fMRI data using Principal Component Analysis, which will preserve the correct phase dynamics, while reducing both computational load and noise level of the data. Then the phase-space was reconstructed using the time-delay embedding method for their principal components and the correlation dimension was estimated by the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm of multiple variable series. The Spatiotemporal Lyapunov Exponents were calculated by using the method based on coupled map lattices. Through nonlinearity testing, there are significant differences of correlation dimensions and Spatiotemporal Lyapunov Exponents between fMRI data and their surrogate data. The fractal dimension and the positive Spatiotemporal Lyapunov Exponents characterize the spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics property of resting-state fMRI data. Therefore, the results suggest that fluctuations presented in resting state may be an inherent model of basal neural activation of human brain, cannot be fully attributed to noise.",

Descriptions of human parietal cortex draw heavily on anatomical schemes developed in other primate species, but the validity of such comparisons has been questioned by claims that there are fundamental differences between the parietal cortex in humans and other primates. A scheme is presented for parcellation of human lateral parietal cortex into component regions on the basis of anatomical connectivity and the functional interactions of the resulting clusters with other brain regions. Anatomical connectivity was estimated using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI)-based tractography, and functional interactions were assessed by correlations in activity measured with functional MRI at rest. Resting-state functional connectivity was also assessed directly in the rhesus macaque lateral parietal cortex in an additional experiment, and the patterns found reflected known neuroanatomical connections. Cross-correlation in the tractography-based connectivity patterns of parietal voxels reliably parcellated human lateral parietal cortex into 10 component clusters. The resting-state functional connectivity of human superior parietal and intraparietal clusters with frontal and extrastriate cortex suggested correspondences with areas in macaque superior and intraparietal sulcus. Functional connectivity patterns with parahippocampal cortex and premotor cortex again suggested fundamental correspondences between inferior parietal cortex in humans and macaques. In contrast, the human parietal cortex differs in the strength of its interactions between the central inferior parietal lobule region and the anterior prefrontal cortex.",

In this study, we investigated the spatial-temporal correlation of hemoglobin concentration signals over the whole head during the resting state. By choosing a source-detector pair as a seed, we calculated the correlation value between its time course and the time course of all other source-detector combinations, and projected them onto a topographic map. In all subjects, we found robust spatial interactions in agreement with previous fMRI and NIRS findings. Strong correlations between the two opposite hemispheres were seen for both sensorimotor and visual cortices. Correlations in the prefrontal cortex were more heterogeneous and dependent on the hemodynamic contrast. HbT provided robust, well defined maps, suggesting that this contrast may be used to better localize functional connectivity. The effects of global systemic physiology were also investigated, particularly low frequency blood pressure oscillations which give rise to broad regions of high correlation and mislead interpretation of the results. These results confirm the feasibility of using functional connectivity with optical methods during the resting state, and validate its use to investigate cortical interactions across the whole head.",

    title = "{Filtering induces correlation in fMRI resting state data.}",
    abstract = "Correlation-based functional MRI connectivity methods typically impose a temporal sample independence assumption on the data. However, the conventional use of temporal filtering to address the high noise content of fMRI data may introduce sample dependence. Violation of the independence assumption has ramifications for the distribution of sample correlation which, if unaccounted for, may invalidate connectivity results. To enable the use of temporal filtering for noise suppression while maintaining the integrity of connectivity results, we derive the distribution of sample correlation between filtered timeseries as a function of the filter frequency response. Corrected distributions are also derived for statistical inference tests of sample correlation between filtered timeseries, including Fisher's z-transformation and the Student's t-test. Crucially, the proposed corrections are valid for any unknown true correlation and arbitrary filter specifications. Empirical simulations demonstrate the potential for temporal filtering to artificially induce connectivity by introducing sample dependence, and verify the utility of the proposed corrections in mitigating this effect. The importance of our corrections is exemplified in a resting state fMRI connectivity analysis: seed-voxel correlation maps generated from filtered data using uncorrected test variates yield an unfeasible number of connections to the left primary motor cortex, suggesting artificially induced connectivity, while maps acquired from filtered data using corrected test variates exhibit bilateral connectivity in the primary motor cortex, in conformance with expected results as seen in the literature",

Twenty young females were selected from a group of 100 participants tested on four standardized cognitive ability tests. The practice and control groups were carefully matched on their ability scores. The practice group played during two sessions per week across 4 weeks (16 h total) under strict supervision in the laboratory, showing systematic performance improvements in the game. A group independent component analysis (GICA) applying multisession temporal concatenation on test-retest resting-state fMRI, jointly with a dual-regression approach, was computed. Supporting the main hypothesis, the key finding reveals an increased correlated activity during rest in certain predefined resting state networks (albeit using uncorrected statistics) attributable to practice with the cognitively demanding tasks of the videogame.

Neurons within the ventral striatum (VS) are sensitive to insulin levels and show altered function in the context of both IR and depression. Hence, VS may represent a critical component of a neural circuitry linking IR to depressed mood.Methods:Ninety adults (aged 30-50 years) free from major psychiatric illnesses and diabetes participated. Fasting blood was sampled, and participants completed a set of questionnaires (including the Beck Depression Inventory-II). Participants also underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Seed-based connectivity analyses, centered on VS, were conducted to examine how resting-state interregional connectivity patterns covaried with IR and depressed mood.Results:Higher levels of IR covaried with increased connective strength between the left VS and two regions: the insula and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC). Moreover, aMCC-VS connectivity predicted depressed mood (b = 0.93, standard error = 0.36, F(change)(1,81) = 6.54, p = .01). Finally, aMCC-VS connectivity was shown by Monte Carlo analysis to mediate the relationship between IR and depressed mood (a*b indirect effect = 0.16, confidence interval = 0.005-0.39, p = .03).Conclusions:IR relates to changes in the functional connectivity between VS and aMCC. These changes in interregional communication partly account for the coupling of IR to depressed mood in otherwise healthy adults. These findings are relevant for understanding bidirectional associations between diabetes risk and depressed mood",

    abstract = {Recent studies in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) tend to support the view that awareness is not related to activity in a single brain region but to thalamo-cortical connectivity in the frontoparietal network. Functional neuroimaging studies have shown preserved albeit disconnected low-level cortical activation in response to external stimulation in patients in a "vegetative state" or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. While activation of these "primary" sensory cortices does not necessarily reflect conscious awareness, activation in higher-order associative cortices in minimally conscious state patients seems to herald some residual perceptual awareness. PET studies have identified a metabolic dysfunction in a widespread frontoparietal "global neuronal workspace" in DOC patients including the midline default mode network ("intrinsic" system) and the lateral frontoparietal cortices or "extrinsic system." Recent studies have investigated the relation of awareness to the functional connectivity within intrinsic and extrinsic networks, and with the thalami in both pathological and pharmacological coma. In brain damaged patients, connectivity in all default network areas was found to be non-linearly correlated with the degree of clinical consciousness impairment, ranging from healthy controls and locked-in syndrome to minimally conscious, vegetative, coma, and brain dead patients. Anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness was also shown to correlate with a global decrease in cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity in both intrinsic and extrinsic networks, but not in auditory, or visual networks. In anesthesia, unconsciousness was also associated with a loss of cross-modal interactions between networks. These results suggest that conscious awareness critically depends on the functional integrity of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical frontoparietal connectivity within and between "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" brain networks},

In the past, this fMRI technique for studying functional connectivity has been applied to subjects that performed no prescribed task ("resting" state). This paper presents the results of applying the same method to task-related activation datasets. Functional connectivity analysis is first performed in areas not involved with the task. Then a method is devised to remove the effects of activation from the data using independent component analysis (ICA) and functional connectivity analysis is repeated. Functional connectivity, which is demonstrated in the "resting brain," is not affected by tasks which activate unrelated brain regions. In addition, ICA effectively removes activation from the data and may allow us to study functional connectivity even in the activated regions.},

The aim of this study was to examine functional connectivity of the PAG in migraine. METHODS: Using resting-state functional MRI, we compared functional connectivity between PAG and a subset of brain areas involved in nociceptive/somatosensory processing and pain modulation in 17 subjects with migraine, during a pain-free state, versus 17 gender- and age-matched controls. We also assessed the relation between intrinsic resting-state correlations within PAG networks and the average monthly frequency of migraine attacks, as well as allodynia. RESULTS: Our findings show stronger connectivity between the PAG and several brain areas within nociceptive and somatosensory processing pathways in migraineurs versus controls. In addition, as the monthly frequency of migraine attacks worsens, the strength of the connectivity in some areas within these pathways increases, whereas a significant decrease in functional resting-state connectivity between the PAG and brain regions with a predominant role in pain modulation (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala) can be evidenced. Finally, migraineurs with a history of allodynia exhibit significantly reduced connectivity between PAG, prefrontal regions, and anterior cingulate compared to migraineurs without allodynia. INTERPRETATION: These data reveal interictal dysfunctional dynamics within pain pathways in migraine manifested as an impairment of the descending pain modulatory circuits, likely leading to loss of pain inhibition, and hyperexcitability primarily in nociceptive areas",

    abstract = "During rest, the brain exhibits slow hemodynamic fluctuations (<0.1 Hz) that are correlated across spatially segregated brain regions, defining functional networks. Resting-state functional networks of people with schizophrenia were found to have graph properties that differ from those of control subjects. Namely, functional graphs from patients exhibit reduced small-worldness, increased hierarchy, lower clustering, improved efficiency and greater robustness. Notably, most of these parameters correlate with patients' cognitive performance.To test if a brain-wide coupling deficit could be at the origin of such network reorganization, we use a model of resting-state activity where the coupling strength can be manipulated. For a range of coupling values, the simulated functional graphs obtained were characterized using graph theory.For a coupling range, simulated graphs shared properties of healthy resting-state functional graphs. On decreasing the coupling strength, the resultant functional graphs exhibited a topological reorganization, in the same way as described in schizophrenia.This work shows how complex functional graph alterations reported in schizophrenia can be accounted for by a decrease in the structural coupling strength. These results are corroborated by reports of lower white matter density in schizophrenia",

Although NFB is being pioneered as a noninvasive tool for treating brain disorders, there is insufficient evidence on the mechanism of its impact on brain function. Furthermore, the dominant rhythm of the human brain is the alpha oscillation (8-12Hz), yet its behavioral significance remains multifaceted and largely correlative. In this study with 34 healthy participants, we examined whether during the performance of an attentional task, the functional connectivity of distinct fMRI networks would be plastically altered after a 30-min session of voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm (n=17) versus a sham-feedback condition (n=17). We reveal that compared to sham-feedback, NFB induced an increase of connectivity within the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate focus), which was detectable 30min after termination of training. This increase in connectivity was negatively correlated with changes in 'on-task' mind-wandering as well as resting state alpha rhythm. Crucially, there was a causal dependence between alpha rhythm modulations during NFB and at subsequent resting state, not exhibited by the SHAM group. Our findings provide neurobehavioral evidence for a temporally direct, plastic impact of NFB on a key cognitive control network of the brain, suggesting a promising basis for its use to treat cognitive disorders under physiological conditions",

We identified two such networks: A frontotemporal network, previously associated with working memory and language processing, showed greater activity when sentences were informative. Independently, greater activity in this network predicted subsequent memory for sentence content. In a separate network, previously associated with resting-state processes and generation of internal thoughts, greater neural activity predicted subsequent memory for informative sentences but also predicted subsequent forgetting for less-informative sentences. These results indicate that in the brain, establishing the information conveyed by a sentence, that is, its contextually based meaning, involves two dissociable networks, both of which are related to processing of sentence meaning and its encoding to memory.",

One of the best-established genome-wide significant risk variants for this highly heritable disorder, the rs1344706 single nucleotide polymorphism in ZNF804A, was recently shown to modulate connectivity in healthy carriers during working memory (WM) in a pattern mirroring that which was found in overt disease. However, it was unclear whether this finding is specific to WM or if it is present regardless of cognitive state. Therefore, we examined genotype effects on connectivity in healthy carriers during rest and an emotion processing task without WM component. 111 healthy German subjects performed a battery of functional imaging tasks. Functional connectivity with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during rest and an implicit emotion recognition task was determined using the seed voxel method and compared to results during WM. During rest and during the emotional task, a pattern of reduced interhemispheric prefrontal connectivity with increasing number of rs1344706 risk alleles could be seen that was close to identical to that during WM, suggesting a state-independent influence of the genetic variant on interhemispheric processing, possibly through structural effects. By contrast, the abnormal prefronto-hippocampal connectivity was only seen during the WM task, indicating a degree of task specificity in agreement with prior results in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings confirm a key role for disturbed functional connectivity in the genetic risk architecture of schizophrenia and identify cognitive state-dependent and independent components with regard to WM function.",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Clinicopathologic phenotypes of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) often overlap, making discrimination difficult. We performed resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to determine whether there were differences between AD and DLB. METHODS: Participants (n = 88) enrolled in a longitudinal study of memory and aging underwent 3-T fcMRI. Clinical diagnoses of probable DLB (n = 15) were made according to published criteria. Cognitively normal control participants (n = 38) were selected for the absence of cerebral amyloid burden as imaged with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). Probable AD cases (n = 35) met published criteria and had appreciable amyloid deposits with PiB imaging. Functional images were collected using a gradient spin-echo sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (T2* weighting). Correlation maps selected a seed region in the combined bilateral precuneus. RESULTS: Participants with DLB had a functional connectivity pattern for the precuneus seed region that was distinct from AD; both the DLB and AD groups had functional connectivity patterns that differed from the cognitively normal group. In the DLB group, we found increased connectivity between the precuneus and regions in the dorsal attention network and the putamen. In contrast, we found decreased connectivity between the precuneus and other task-negative default regions and visual cortices. There was also a reversal of connectivity in the right hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in functional connectivity in DLB indicate patterns of activation that are distinct from those seen in AD and may improve discrimination of DLB from AD and cognitively normal individuals. Since patterns of connectivity differ between AD and DLB groups, measurements of BOLD functional connectivity can shed further light on neuroanatomic connections that distinguish DLB from AD.",

We investigated human brain function during hypnotic paralysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), focussing on two core regions of the default mode network and the representation of the paralysed hand in the primary motor cortex. Hypnotic suggestion induced an observable left-hand paralysis in 19 participants. Resting-state fMRI at 3T was performed in pseudo-randomised order awake and in the hypnotic condition. Functional connectivity analyses revealed increased connectivity of the precuneus with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, and a dorsal part of the precuneus. Functional connectivity of the medial frontal cortex and the primary motor cortex remained unchanged. Our results reveal that the precuneus plays a pivotal role during maintenance of an altered state of consciousness. The increased coupling of selective cortical areas with the precuneus supports the concept that hypnotic paralysis may be mediated by a modified representation of the self which impacts motor abilities.",

The structural hemispheric asymmetries of ACC have been revealed by several neuroimaging studies. However potential functional hemispheric asymmetries of ACC remain less clear. Investigating the functional hemispheric asymmetries of ACC helps for a better understanding of ACC function. The aim of this study was to use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine hemispheric differences in the functional networks associated with ACC-cd in the two hemispheres. ROI-based functional connectivity analysis was performed on a group of 49 right-handed healthy volunteers. The left and right ACC-cd showed significant differences in their patterns of connectivity with a variety of brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, superior parietal lobule and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex in their ipsilateral cerebral cortex, as well as cerebellar tonsil and inferior semilunar lobule in their contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Specifically, for these areas, we found significantly greater connectivity strength with ACC-cd in the right hemisphere than the left, regardless of whether the connection was positive or negative. The current results highlight the presence of clear asymmetries in functional networks associated with ACC-cd. Future functional imaging studies are needed to give greater attention to the lateralized ACC functional networks which are observed",

    abstract = {Remodeling of neuronal structures and networks is believed to significantly contribute to (partial) restoration of functions after stroke. However, it has been unclear to what extent the brain reorganizes and how this correlates with functional recovery in relation to stroke severity. We applied serial resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging together with behavioral testing to relate longitudinal modifications in functional and structural connectivity of the sensorimotor neuronal network to changes in sensorimotor function after unilateral stroke in rats. We found that gradual improvement of functions is associated with wide-ranging changes in functional and structural connectivity within bilateral neuronal networks, particularly after large stroke. Both after medium and large stroke, brain reorganization eventually leads to (partial) normalization of neuronal signal synchronization within the affected sensorimotor cortical network (intraregional signal coherence), as well as between the affected and unaffected sensorimotor cortices (interhemispheric functional connectivity). Furthermore, the bilateral network configuration shifts from subacutely increased "small-worldness," possibly reflective of initial excessive neuronal clustering and wiring, toward a baseline small-world topology, optimal for global information transfer and local processing, at chronic stages. Cortical network remodeling was accompanied by recovery of initially disrupted structural integrity in corticospinal tract regions, which correlated positively with retrieval of sensorimotor functions. Our study demonstrates that the degree of functional recovery after stroke is associated with the extent of preservation or restoration of ipsilesional corticospinal tracts in combination with reinstatement of interhemispheric neuronal signal synchronization and normalization of small-world cortical network organization},

In the present study, task-related deactivation as well as structural and resting state functional connectivity of the DMN were examined using diffusional tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging in non-dysmorphic and dysmorphic PAE populations and compared to healthy controls. The dysmorphic PAE group was found to have reduced DMN deactivation as compared to controls, indicating poorer attentional modulation during the cognitive task. Additionally, structural connectivity and baseline functional connectivity were lower in both PAE groups as compared to controls. Primarily the findings suggest that learning problems seen with PAE may be a combination of general attentional and specific cognitive deficits.

Methods Functional connectivity was examined in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) (n = 9) and healthy controls (n = 11) by calculating partial correlations between low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations extracted from 15 brain regions. Results Patients with FM had more positive and negative correlations within the pain network than healthy controls. Patients with FM displayed enhanced functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with the insula (INS) and basal ganglia (p values between .01 and .05), the secondary somatosensory area with the caudate (CAU) (p = .012), the primary motor cortex with the supplementary motor area (p = .007), the globus pallidus with the amygdala and superior temporal sulcus (both p values < .05), and the medial prefrontal cortex with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and CAU (both p values < .05). Functional connectivity of the ACC with the amygdala and periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter (p values between .001 and .05), the thalamus with the INS and PAG (both p values < .01), the INS with the putamen (p = .038), the PAG with the CAU (p = .038), the secondary somatosensory area with the motor cortex and PCC (both p values < .05), and the PCC with the superior temporal sulcus (p = .002) was also reduced in FM. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between depression and PAG connectivity strength with the thalamus (r = -0.64, p = .003) and ACC (r = -0.60, p = .004). Conclusions These findings demonstrate that patients with FM display a substantial imbalance of the connectivity within the pain network during rest, suggesting that chronic pain may also lead to changes in brain activity during internally generated thought processes such as occur at rest",

In the brain, there is spontaneous firing of neurons even in the resting state. Such spontaneous firing will increase local blood flow, cause MRI signal fluctuations, and affect remotely located neurons through the efferent output. By calculating covariance of each voxel referenced to the time course of a selected brain region, it is possible to detect the neurons connected to the selected region. Using this covariance method, neural connectivity to primary motor cortex was assessed during a resting state in six healthy right-handed volunteers. This interregional connectivity is similar to connectivity established by other anatomical, histochemical, and physiological techniques.

    abstract = "Recently, increasing attention has been focused on the investigation of the human brain connectome that describes the patterns of structural and functional connectivity networks of the human brain. Many studies of the human connectome have demonstrated that the brain network follows a small-world topology with an intrinsically cohesive modular structure and includes several network hubs in the medial parietal regions. However, most of these studies have only focused on undirected connections between regions in which the directions of information flow are not taken into account. How the brain regions causally influence each other and how the directed network of human brain is topologically organized remain largely unknown. Here, we applied linear multivariate Granger causality analysis (GCA) and graph theoretical approaches to a resting-state functional MRI dataset with a large cohort of young healthy participants (n = 86) to explore connectivity patterns of the population-based whole-brain functional directed network. This directed brain network exhibited prominent small-world properties, which obviously improved previous results of functional MRI studies showing weak small-world properties in the directed brain networks in terms of a kernel-based GCA and individual analysis. This brain network also showed significant modular structures associated with 5 well known subsystems: fronto-parietal, visual, paralimbic/limbic, subcortical and primary systems. Importantly, we identified several driving hubs predominantly located in the components of the attentional network (e.g., the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, insula and fusiform gyrus) and several driven hubs predominantly located in the components of the default mode network (e.g., the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule). Further split-half analyses indicated that our results were highly reproducible between two independent subgroups. The current study demonstrated the directions of spontaneous information flow and causal influences in the directed brain networks, thus providing new insights into our understanding of human brain functional connectome. © 2011 Yan, He.",

We examined whether functional connectivity among those brain regions typically active during rest depends on ongoing and recent task demands and individual differences. We probed the temporal coordination among these regions during periods of language comprehension and during the rest periods that followed comprehension. Our findings show that the topography of this "rest network" varies with exogenous processing demands. The network encompassed more highly interconnected regions during rest than during listening, but also when listening to unsurprising vs. surprising information. Furthermore, connectivity patterns during rest varied as a function of recent listening experience. Individual variability in connectivity strength was associated with cognitive function: more attentive comprehenders demonstrated weaker connectivity during language comprehension, and a greater differentiation between connectivity during comprehension and rest. The regions we examined have generally been thought to form an invariant physiological and functional network whose activity reflects spontaneous cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that their function extends beyond the mediation of unconstrained thought, and that they play an important role in higher-level cognitive function},

However, patients with periventricular leucomalacia on conventional magnetic resonance imaging do not always have motor dysfunction and preterm children without neurological abnormalities may have periventricular leucomalacia. In addition, it is uncertain whether descending motor tract or overlying cortical injury is related to motor impairment. To investigate the relationship between motor pathway injury and motor impairment, we conducted voxelwise correlation analysis using tract-based spatial statistics of white matter diffusion anisotropy and voxel-based-morphometry of grey matter injury in patients with periventricular leucomalacia and spastic diplegia (n = 43, mean 12.86 ± 4.79 years, median 12 years). We also evaluated motor cortical and thalamocortical connectivity at resting state in 11 patients using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The functional connectivity results of patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were compared with those of age-matched normal controls. Since $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors play an important role in the remodelling process, we measured neuronal $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential with dynamic positron emission tomography scans (n = 27) and compared the binding potential map of the patient group with controls (n = 20). In the current study, white matter volume reduction did not show significant correlation with motor dysfunction. Although fractional anisotropy within most of the major white matter tracts were significantly lower than that of age-matched healthy controls (P < 0.05, family wise error corrected), fractional anisotropy mainly within the bilateral corticospinal tracts and posterior body and isthmus of the corpus callosum showed more significant correlation with motor dysfunction (P < 0.03) than thalamocortical pathways (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected). Cortical volume of the pre- and post-central gyri and the paracentral lobule tended to be negatively correlated with motor function. The motor cortical connectivity was diminished mainly within the bilateral somatosensory cortex, paracentral lobule, cingulate motor area and visual cortex in the patient group. Thalamovisual connectivity was not diminished despite severe optic radiation injury. $\gamma$-Aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential was focally increased within the lower extremity homunculus, cingulate cortex, visual cortex and cerebellum in the patient group (P < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). In conclusion, descending motor tract injury along with overlying cortical volume reduction and reduced functional connectivity appears to be a leading pathophysiological mechanism of motor dysfunction in patients with periventricular leucomalacia. Increased regional $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor binding potential appears to result from a compensatory plasticity response after prenatal brain injury.",

Separate regions of the cerebellum are connected to distinct cerebral areas, forming a complex topography. In this study we explored the organization of cerebrocerebellar circuits in the human using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using nonlinear deformation of the cerebellum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. The foot, hand, and tongue representations were localized in subjects performing movements. fcMRI maps derived from seed regions placed in different parts of the motor body representation yielded the expected inverted map of somatomotor topography in the anterior lobe and the upright map in the posterior lobe. Next, we mapped the complete topography of the cerebellum by estimating the principal cerebral target for each point in the cerebellum in a discovery sample of 500 subjects and replicated the topography in 500 independent subjects. The majority of the human cerebellum maps to association areas. Quantitative analysis of 17 distinct cerebral networks revealed that the extent of the cerebellum dedicated to each network is proportional to the network's extent in the cerebrum with a few exceptions, including primary visual cortex, which is not represented in the cerebellum. Like somatomotor representations, cerebellar regions linked to association cortex have separate anterior and posterior representations that are oriented as mirror images of one another. The orderly topography of the representations suggests that the cerebellum possesses at least two large, homotopic maps of the full cerebrum and possibly a smaller third map",

    abstract = {Presurgical language mapping for patients with lesions close to language areas is critical to neurosurgical decision-making for preservation of language function. As a clinical noninvasive imaging technique, functional MRI (fMRI) is used to identify language areas by measuring blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal change while patients perform carefully timed language vs. control tasks. This task-based fMRI critically depends on task performance, excluding many patients who have difficulty performing language tasks due to neurologic deficits. On the basis of recent discovery of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), we propose a "task-free" paradigm acquiring fMRI data when patients simply are at rest. This paradigm is less demanding for patients to perform and easier for technologists to administer. We investigated the feasibility of this approach in right-handed healthy control subjects. First, group independent component analysis (ICA) was applied on the training group (14 subjects) to identify group level language components based on expert rating results. Then, four empirically and structurally defined language network templates were assessed for their ability to identify language components from individuals' ICA output of the testing group (18 subjects) based on spatial similarity analysis. Results suggest that it is feasible to extract language activations from rs-fMRI at the individual subject level, and two empirically defined templates (that focuses on frontal language areas and that incorporates both frontal and temporal language areas) demonstrated the best performance. We propose a semi-automated language component identification procedure and discuss the practical concerns and suggestions for this approach to be used in clinical fMRI language mapping.

"No task" fMRI (BOLD) data were collected from healthy volunteers while awake and at low and moderate levels of sedation, induced by the anesthetic agent propofol. Our data show that connectivity of the posterior cingulate changes during sedation to include areas that are not traditionally considered to be part of the default mode network, such as the motor/somatosensory cortices, the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the reticular activating system.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This neuroanatomical signature resembles that of non-REM sleep, and may be evidence for a system that reduces its discriminable states and switches into more stereotypic patterns of firing under sedation},

    abstract = "Neural mechanisms underlying word processing have been extensively studied. It has been revealed that when individuals are engaged in active word processing, a complex network of cortical regions is activated. However, it is entirely unknown whether the word-processing regions are intrinsically organized without any explicit processing tasks during the resting state. The present study investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity between word-processing regions during the resting state with the use of fMRI methodology. The low-frequency fluctuations were observed between the left middle fusiform gyrus and a number of cortical regions. They included the left angular gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, bilateral pars opercularis, and left pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, which have been implicated in phonological and semantic processing. Additionally, the activations were also observed in the bilateral superior parietal lobule and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, which have been suggested to provide top-down monitoring on the visual-spatial processing of words. The findings of our study indicate an intrinsically organized network during the resting state that likely prepares the visual system to anticipate the highly probable word input for ready and effective processing.",

A brief overview is given of the hardware development followed by a discussion of EEG-fMRI applications. The technique's development was clinically motivated in the context of epilepsy. Accordingly, the evolution of studies trying to identify with EEG-fMRI the origin of individual epileptiform discharges up to those revealing general mechanisms of epilepsy syndromes is sketched. In epilepsy centers experienced with the methodology, EEG-fMRI has found its place in the presurgical evaluation of patients. In cognitive neuroscience, the multimodal technique has significantly contributed to the understanding of phenomena of the resting state and neuronal oscillations. While most of the studies discussed relate EEG to fMRI by means of prediction, the development of forward models facilitating the symmetrical 'fusion' of EEG and fMRI data is the subject of current neuro-computational research. Recently, intracranial EEG has been safely recorded during (functional) MRI broadly extending the perspectives for epilepsy and research into neurovascular coupling. EEG-fMRI has evolved into a mature, generally accessible and in principle easily applicable technique, which is a great achievement. Because this at the same time bears the risk of unreflected use, EEG-fMRI safety issues are also highlighted",

    abstract = "Current resting-state network analysis often looks for coherent spontaneous BOLD signal fluctuations at frequencies below 0.1Hz in a multiple-minutes scan. However hemodynamic signal variation can occur at a faster rate, causing changes in functional connectivity at a smaller time scale. In this study we proposed to use MREG technique to increase the temporal resolution of resting-state fMRI. A three-dimensional single-shot concentric shells trajectory was used instead of conventional EPI, with a TR of 100ms and a nominal spatial resolution of 4×4×4mm(3). With this high sampling rate we were able to resolve frequency components up to 5Hz, which prevents major physiological noises from aliasing with the BOLD signal of interest. We used a sliding-window method on signal components at different frequency bands, to look at the non-stationary connectivity maps over the course of each scan session. The aim of the study paradigm was to specifically observe visual and motor resting-state networks. Preliminary results have found corresponding networks at frequencies above 0.1Hz. These networks at higher frequencies showed better stability in both spatial and temporal dimensions from the sliding-window analysis of the time series, which suggests the potential of using high temporal resolution MREG sequences to track dynamic resting-state networks at sub-minute time scale",

    abstract = "Functional connectivity-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data (fMRI) is an emerging technique for human brain mapping. One powerful method for the investigation of functional connectivity is independent component analysis (ICA) of concatenated data. However, this research field is evolving toward processing increasingly larger database taking into account inter-individual variability. Concatenated data analysis only handles these features using some additional procedures such as bootstrap or including a model of between-subject variability during the preprocessing step of the ICA. In order to alleviate these limitations, we propose a method based on group analysis of individual ICA components, using a multi-scale clustering (MICCA). MICCA start with two steps repeated several times: 1) single subject data ICA followed by 2) clustering of all subject independent components according to a spatial similarity criterion. A final third step consists in selecting reproducible clusters across the repetitions of the two previous steps. The core of the innovation lies in the multi-scale and unsupervised clustering algorithm built as a chain of three processes: robust proto-cluster creation, aggregation of the proto-clusters, and cluster consolidation. We applied MICCA to the analysis of 310 fMRI resting state dataset. MICCA identified 28 resting state brain networks. Overall, the cluster neuroanatomical substrate included 98\% of the cerebrum gray matter. MICCA results proved to be reproducible in a random splitting of the data sample and more robust than the classical concatenation method",

    abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Three cingulate motor areas have been described in monkeys, the rostral, dorsal, and ventral cingulate motor areas, and would control limbic-related motor activity. However, little anatomical data are available in human about the functional networks these cingulate areas underlie. Therefore, networks anchored in the rostral and caudal cingulate motor areas (rCMA and cCMA, respectively) were studied in human using functional connectivity during the brain resting state. Since the rCMA and cCMA are located just under the pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA and SMA), the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks were also studied to ensure that these four circuits were correctly dissociated. METHODS: Data from 14 right-handed healthy volunteers were acquired at rest and analyzed by region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations of separate ROIs located in rCMA, cCMA, pre-SMA, and SMA were successively used to identify significant temporal correlations with BOLD signal fluctuations of other brain regions. RESULTS: Low-frequency BOLD signal of the CMA was correlated with signal fluctuations in the prefrontal, cingulate, insular, premotor, motor, medial and inferior parietal cortices, putamen and thalamus, and anticorrelated with the default-mode network. rCMA was more in relation with prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and language-associated cortices than cCMA more related to sensory cortex. These cingulate networks were very similar to the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks, although pre-SMA and SMA showed stronger correlation with the prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and with the cerebellum and the superior parietal cortex, respectively. CONCLUSION: The human cingulate motor areas constitute an interface between sensorimotor, limbic and executive systems, sharing common cortical, striatal, and thalamic relays with the overlying premotor medial areas.",

Using resting state fMRI, we assessed whole-brain network structure in patients with focal brain lesions. Only damage to those brain regions important for communication between subnetworks (e.g., "connectors")-but not to those brain regions important for communication within sub-networks (e.g., "hubs")-led to decreases in modularity, a measure of the integrity of network organization. Critically, this network dysfunction extended into the structurally intact hemisphere. Thus, focal brain damage can have a widespread, nonlocal impact on brain network organization when there is damage to regions important for the communication between networks. These findings fundamentally revise our understanding of the remote effects of focal brain damage and may explain numerous puzzling cases of functional deficits that are observed following brain injury},

We review how functional MRI during both memory encoding and at rest is able to define APOE4 genotype-dependent physiological changes decades before potential development of AD and demonstrate changes distinct from those with healthy aging. More generally, imaging provides a powerful quantitative measure of phenotype for understanding associations arising from whole genome studies in AD. Structural connectivity measures derived from diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) methods offer additional markers of neuropathology arising from the secondary changes in axonal caliber and myelination that accompany decreased neuronal activity and neurodegeneration. We illustrate applications of DTI for more finely mapping neurodegenerative changes with AD in the thalamus in vivo and for defining neuropathological changes in the white matter itself. The latter efforts have highlighted how sensitivity to the neuropathology can be enhanced by using more specific DTI measures and interpreting them relative to knowledge of local white matter anatomy in the healthy brain. Together, our studies and related work are helping to establish the exciting potential of a new range of MRI methods as neuropathological measures and as biomarkers of disease progression",

    abstract = {Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is among those brain regions having the highest baseline metabolic activity at rest and one that exhibits decreases from this baseline across a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors in functional imaging studies. This high metabolic rate and this behavior suggest the existence of an organized mode of default brain function, elements of which may be either attenuated or enhanced. Extant data suggest that these MPFC regions may contribute to the neural instantiation of aspects of the multifaceted "self." We explore this important concept by targeting and manipulating elements of MPFC default state activity. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, subjects made two judgments, one self-referential, the other not, in response to affectively normed pictures: pleasant vs. unpleasant (an internally cued condition, ICC) and indoors vs. outdoors (an externally cued condition, ECC). The ICC was preferentially associated with activity increases along the dorsal MPFC. These increases were accompanied by decreases in both active task conditions in ventral MPFC. These results support the view that dorsal and ventral MPFC are differentially influenced by attentiondemanding tasks and explicitly self-referential tasks. The presence of self-referential mental activity appears to be associated with increases from the baseline in dorsal MPFC. Reductions in ventral MPFC occurred consistent with the fact that attention-demanding tasks attenuate emotional processing. We posit that both self-referential mental activity and emotional processing represent elements of the default state as represented by activity in MPFC. We suggest that a useful way to explore the neurobiology of the self is to explore the nature of default state activity.},

Some brain systems seem to bias toward better perceptual performance and others toward worse. We tested whether these observations generalize to another as of yet unassessed sensory modality, audition, and a nonspatial but memory-dependent paradigm. In a sparse event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design, we investigated detection of auditory near-threshold stimuli as a function of prestimulus baseline activity in early auditory cortex as well as several distributed networks that were defined on the basis of resting state functional connectivity. In accord with previous studies, hits were associated with higher prestimulus activity in related early sensory cortex as well as in a system comprising anterior insula, anterior cingulate, and thalamus, which other studies have related to processing salience and maintaining task set. In contrast to previous studies, however, higher prestimulus activity in the so-called dorsal attention system of frontal and parietal cortex biased toward misses, whereas higher activity in the so-called default mode network that includes posterior cingulate and precuneus biased toward hits. These results contradict a simple dichotomic view on the function of these two latter brain systems where higher ongoing activity in the dorsal attention network would facilitate perceptual performance, and higher activity in the default mode network would deteriorate perceptual performance. Instead, we show that the way in which ongoing activity fluctuations impact on perception depends on the specific sensory (i.e., nonspatial) and cognitive (i.e., mnemonic) context that is relevant",

While functional connections have been shown to rely on the underlying structural connectivity, direct structural connections have been studied in only a few distributed cortical systems so far. It is well known that subcortical nuclei have structural connections to the entire cortex. We hypothesized that structural subcortico-cortical connections may provide integral routes for communication between cortical resting state networks, and that changes in the integrity of these connections have a role in cognitive aging. We combined anatomical MRI, diffusion tensor MRI, and resting state fMRI in 100 healthy elderly to identify fiber bundles connecting cortical resting state networks to subcortical nuclei. In identified tracts, white matter fiber bundle integrity measures were compared to composite cognitive measures on executive function, processing speed, and memory performance. The integrity (FA values) in selected fiber bundles correlated strongly with cognitive measures on executive function and processing speed. Correlation was most pronounced between executive function and fiber bundles connecting the putamen to the dorsal attention network (r=0.73, p<0.001). Our findings show that unique cortico-subcortical fiber bundles can be identified for a range of cortical resting state networks, and indicate that these connections play an important role in cortical resting state network communication and cognition.",

This fMRI study focuses first on revealing components of the DMN which are related to ABM and those which are unrelated to ABM, and second on extracting the neural bases which are specifically devoted to ABM.

We delineated the overlap between the regions that showed less activation during semantic memory and number counting relative to rest, which correspond to the DMN, and the areas that showed greater or less activation during ABM relative to rest. ABM-specific activation was defined as the overlap between the contrast of ABM versus rest and the contrast of ABM versus semantic memory. The fMRI results showed that greater activation as well as less activation during ABM relative to rest overlapped considerably with the DMN, indicating that the DMN is segregated to the regions which are functionally related to ABM and the regions which are unrelated to ABM.

    abstract = "Background: Research on the neural correlates of risk-related behaviors and personality traits has provided insight into mechanisms underlying both normal and pathological decision-making. Task-based neuroimaging studies implicate a distributed network of brain regions in risky decision-making. What remains to be understood are the interactions between these regions and their relation to individual differences in personality variables associated with real-world risk-taking. Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods to investigate differences in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture associated with beliefs about the consequences of risky behavior. We obtained an individual measure of expected benefit from engaging in risky behavior, indicating a risk seeking or risk-averse personality, for each of 21 participants from whom we also collected a series of R-fMRI scans. The expected benefit scores were entered in statistical models assessing the RSFC of brain regions consistently implicated in both the evaluation of risk and reward, and cognitive control (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate). We specifically focused on significant brainbehavior relationships that were stable across R-fMRI scans collected one year apart. Two stable expected benefit-RSFC relationships were observed: decreased expected benefit (increased risk-aversion) was associated with 1) stronger positive functional connectivity between right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right insula, and 2) weaker negative functional connectivity between left nucleus accumbens and right parieto-occipital cortex. Conclusions/Significance: Task-based activation in the IFG and insula has been associated with risk-aversion, while activation in the nucleus accumbens and parietal cortex has been associated with both risk seeking and risk-averse tendencies. Our results suggest that individual differences in attitudes toward risk-taking are reflected in the brain's functional architecture and may have implications for engaging in real-world risky behaviors. © 2010 Cox et al.",

    abstract = "Networks of functional connectivity are highly consistent across participants, suggesting that functional connectivity is for a large part predetermined. However, several studies have shown that functional connectivity may change depending on instructions or previous experience. In the present study, we investigated whether 6 weeks of practice with a working memory task changes functional connectivity during a resting period preceding the task. We focused on two task-relevant networks, the frontoparietal network and the default network, using seed regions in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), respectively. After practice, young adults showed increased functional connectivity between the right MFG and other regions of the frontoparietal network, including bilateral superior frontal gyrus, paracingulate gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, they showed reduced functional connectivity between the medial PFC and right posterior middle temporal gyrus. Moreover, a regression with performance changes revealed a positive relation between performance increases and changes of frontoparietal connectivity, and a negative relation between performance increases and changes of default network connectivity. Next, to study whether experience-dependent effects would be different during development, we also examined practice effects in a pilot sample of 12-year-old children. No practice effects were found in this group, suggesting that practice-related changes of functional connectivity are age-dependent. Nevertheless, future studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

Support vector classification is the most popular of these techniques, owing to reports that it has better prediction accuracy and is less sensitive to noise. Support vector classification was applied to learn functional connectivity patterns that distinguish patients with depression from healthy volunteers. In addition, two feature selection algorithms were implemented (one filter method, one wrapper method) that incorporate reliability information into the feature selection process. These reliability feature selections methods were compared to two previously proposed feature selection methods. A support vector classifier was trained that reliably distinguishes healthy volunteers from clinically depressed patients. The reliability feature selection methods outperformed previously utilized methods. The proposed framework for applying support vector classification to functional connectivity data is applicable to other disease states beyond major depression.",

In this study, resting networks of LFFs were estimated from the whole-brain BOLD signals using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA provides a hypothesis-free technique for determining the functional connectivity map that does not require a priori selection of a seed region. Twenty Long-Evans rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1\%, n = 10) or ketamine/xylazine (50/6 mg . kg(-1) . h(-1) ip, n = 10) and imaged for 5-10 min in a 9.4 T MR scanner without experimental stimulation or task requirement. Independent, synchronous LFFs of BOLD signals were found to exist in clustered, bilaterally symmetric regions of both cortical and subcortical structures, including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, motor cortices, visual cortices, posterior and anterior cingulate cortices, hippocampi, caudate-putamen, and thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. The somatosensory and motor cortices typically demonstrated both symmetric and asymmetric components with unique frequency profiles. Similar independent network components were found under isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. The report demonstrates, for the first time, 12 independent resting networks that are bilaterally synchronous in different cortical and subcortical areas of the rat brain.",

    abstract = {Task-induced deactivation (TID) refers to a regional decrease in blood flow during an active task relative to a "resting" or "passive" baseline. We tested the hypothesis that TID results from a reallocation of processing resources by parametrically manipulating task difficulty within three factors: target discriminability, stimulus presentation rate, and short-term memory load. Subjects performed an auditory target detection task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), responding to a single target tone or, in the short-term memory load conditions, to target sequences. Seven task conditions (a common version and two additional levels for each of the three factors) were each alternated with "rest" in a block design. Analysis of covariance identified brain regions in which TID occurred. Analyses of variance identified seven regions (left anterior cingulate/superior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate gyrus, left and right posterior cingulate gyrus, left posterior parieto-occipital cortex, and right precuneus) in which TID magnitude varied across task levels within a factor. Follow-up tests indicated that for each of the three factors, TID magnitude increased with task difficulty. These results suggest that TID represents reallocation of processing resources from areas in which TID occurs to areas involved in task performance. Short-term memory load and stimulus rate also predict suppression of spontaneous thought, and many of the brain areas showing TID have been linked with semantic processing, supporting claims that TID may be due in part to suspension of spontaneous semantic processes that occur during "rest" (Binder et al., 1999). The concept that the typical "resting state" is actually a condition characterized by rich cognitive activity has important implications for the design and analysis of neuroimaging studies.},

    abstract = "Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that several brain regions--namely, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and the bilateral angular gyrus--are more active during resting states than during cognitive tasks (i.e., default mode network). Although there is evidence showing that the default mode network is associated with unconscious state, it is unclear whether this network is associated with unconscious processing when normal human subjects perform tasks without awareness. We manipulated the level of conscious processing in normal subjects by asking them to perform an implicit and an explicit memory task, and analyzed signal changes in the default mode network for the stimuli versus baseline in both tasks. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis showed that the level of activation in regions within this network during the implicit task was not significantly different from that during the baseline, except in the left angular gyrus and the insula. There was strong deactivation for the explicit task when compared with the implicit task in the default mode regions, except in the left angular gyrus and the left middle temporal gyrus. These data suggest that the activity in the default network is sustained and less disrupted when an implicit memory task is performed, but is suspended when explicit retrieval is required. These results provide evidence that the default mode network is associated with unconscious processing when human subjects perform an implicit memory task.",

Re-normalized PDC (rPDC) values were computed to determine directional connectivity at the group level at each frequency. Results The integrative role was suggested for precuneus while the role of major divergence region may be proposed to primary auditory cortex and amygdala.

To test the related prediction of age-related increase in the Hurst exponent, H, of functional MRI time series, and its possible cholinergic mechanisms, two groups of healthy participants (old [mean age = 65 years]; young [mean age = 22 years]; N = 11 per group) were scanned twice at rest, following placebo and a muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine 0.3 mg. Older age was associated with significant increase in H of fMRI time series in bilateral hippocampus. Similarly, scopolamine was associated with increased H in left hippocampus; and there was an age-by-drug interaction in medial temporal lobe whereby older participants specifically had increased H following scopolamine. Scopolamine also enhanced fronto-hippocampal low-frequency coherence, and this could be correlated with its effect on hippocampal H. Thus, increased persistence of hippocampal dynamics in older subjects is demonstrable by resting fMRI; scopolamine mimics these effects, especially in older subjects, implying a cholinergic mechanism for age-related change; and cholinergic effects on hippocampal dynamics are associated with enhanced functional connectivity between frontal cortex and hippocampus",

The shared functional neuroanatomy of these processes has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of independent task domains (Spreng, Mar \& Kim, 2009) and within subjects performing both tasks (Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, \& Rosenbaum, 2010; Spreng \& Grady, 2010). Here, we examine spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI BOLD signal during rest from two separate regions key to memory and mentalizing, the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction, respectively. Activity in these two regions was then correlated with the entire brain in a resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Although the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction were not correlated with each other, both were correlated with a distributed network of brain regions. These regions were consistent with the previously observed overlap between autobiographical memory and mentalizing evoked brain activity found in past studies. Reliable patterns of overlap included the superior temporal sulcus, anterior temporal lobe, lateral inferior parietal cortex (angular gyrus), posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and the amygdala. We propose that the functional overlap facilitates the integration of personal and interpersonal information and provides a means for personal experiences to become social conceptual knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, informs strategic social behavior in support of personal goals. In closing, we argue for a new perspective within social cognitive neuroscience, emphasizing the importance of memory in social cognition",

    abstract = "Simultaneous acquisition of EEG and fMRI data enables the investigation of the hemodynamic correlates of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during the resting state in patients with epilepsy. This paper addresses two issues: (1) the semi-automation of IED classification in statistical modelling for fMRI analysis and (2) the improvement of IED detection to increase experimental fMRI efficiency. For patients with multiple IED generators, sensitivity to IED-correlated BOLD signal changes can be improved when the fMRI analysis model distinguishes between IEDs of differing morphology and field. In an attempt to reduce the subjectivity of visual IED classification, we implemented a semi-automated system, based on the spatio-temporal clustering of EEG events. We illustrate the technique's usefulness using EEG-fMRI data from a subject with focal epilepsy in whom 202 IEDs were visually identified and then clustered semi-automatically into four clusters. Each cluster of IEDs was modelled separately for the purpose of fMRI analysis. This revealed IED-correlated BOLD activations in distinct regions corresponding to three different IED categories. In a second step, Signal Space Projection (SSP) was used to project the scalp EEG onto the dipoles corresponding to each IED cluster. This resulted in 123 previously unrecognised IEDs, the inclusion of which, in the General Linear Model (GLM), increased the experimental efficiency as reflected by significant BOLD activations. We have also shown that the detection of extra IEDs is robust in the face of fluctuations in the set of visually detected IEDs. We conclude that automated IED classification can result in more objective fMRI models of IEDs and significantly increased sensitivity.",

    abstract = "Schizophrenia is a major mental illness that is characterized by psychosis, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment. High comorbidity rates with substance use disorders have consistently been found - especially with abuse of cannabis and psychostimulants. While the role of these drugs in the onset of psychosis and schizophrenia has received much attention, relatively few studies have been conducted on the impact of psychoactive substances on the course of schizophrenia. In this review, study findings measuring the effects of psychoactive substances with structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging methods are described in patients suffering from substance use disorder and schizophrenia. Both Schizophrenia and substance abuse are associated with different functional brain alterations. In addicted individuals, drug-related cues and drug administration lead to increased neurofunctional activity in limbic and prefrontal brain regions compared to healthy controls. Chronic drug abuse is associated with grey matter loss in these areas. In schizophrenic patients, cognitive imaging in the frontal and temporal brain areas has showed decreased neural activity during the resting state. In chronic schizophrenic patients, the greatest loss of brain volume was found in those patients with additional substance abuse. Neuroimaging studies highlight the significance of regular drug use in schizophrenia. Whereas schizophrenic patients with and without substance abuse may not differ in structural imaging at the onset of illness, regular drug abuse seems to be a significant risk factor for severe loss of brain volume in the course of schizophrenia.",

    abstract = "Purpose: Early surgical intervention can be advantageous in the treatment of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The success of TLE surgery relies on accurate lateralization of the seizure onset. The purpose of this study was to determine whether resting functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity mapping of the hippocampus has the potential to complement conventional presurgical evaluations in distinguishing left from right TLE. In addition, we sought to determine whether this same network might separate patients with favorable from unfavorable postoperative outcomes. Methods: Resting fMRI acquisitions were performed on 21 patients with TLE and 15 healthy controls. The patients included seven patients with left TLE and seven patients with right TLE with seizure-free postoperative outcome, and five patients with left TLE and two patients with right TLE with recurring seizures after surgery. Functional connectivity maps to each hippocampus were determined for each subject and were compared between the controls and the seizure-free patients with left TLE and with right TLE. The one network identified was then quantified in the patients with TLE and recurring seizures. Key Findings: The resting functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and the ventral lateral nucleus of the right thalamus was the most statistically significant network to distinguish between seizure-free patients with left TLE and with right TLE with high sensitivity and specificity. This connectivity was also significantly greater in the seizure-free patients with left TLE than the healthy controls. Finally, six of the seven patients in whom seizures recurred after surgery had connectivity values in this network unlike those who were seizure-free. Significance: This study identified a region in the ventral lateral nucleus of the right thalamus whose connectivity to the hippocampi separates left from right TLE subjects. This suggests that the quantification of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) connectivity across this network may be a potential indicator of lateralization of TLE that may be added to other presurgical MRI assessments. Further validation in a larger, independent cohort is required",

Such oscillations represent fluctuations in blood oxygenation level and cortical blood flow thus allowing computation of neurophysiologic connectivity.

Resting-state data were processed and significant functional connectivity within the sensorimotor area was identified using independent component analysis. Unilateral functional connectivity in the developing sensory-motor cortices was observed. Power spectral analysis showed that slow frequency oscillations dominated the hemodynamic signal at this age, with, on average, a peak frequency for all subjects of 0.02 Hz. Our data suggest that there is more intrahemispheric than interhemispheric connectivity in the sensorimotor area of naturally sleeping infants. This non-invasive imaging technique, developed to allow reliable scanning of normal infants without sedation, enabled computation of neurophysiologic connectivity for the first time in naturally sleeping infants. Such techniques permit elucidation of the role of slow cortical oscillations during early brain development and may reveal critical information regarding the normative development and lateralization of brain networks across time.",

    abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate, using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the functional connectivity within and among brain networks in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), compared with healthy controls and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD). METHODS: Twelve bvFTD patients were compared with 30 controls and 18 pAD patients. Functional connectivity within the salience, default mode (DMN), executive (EXN), attention/working memory (ATT/WM), and dorsal attentional networks was assessed using independent component analysis. The temporal associations among RS networks (RSNs) were explored using the functional network connectivity toolbox. RESULTS: A decreased dorsal salience network (DSN) connectivity, mainly involving the anterior cingulum, was observed in bvFTD versus controls and pAD. BvFTD was also characterized by a decreased ventral salience network connectivity in the basal ganglia, and divergent connectivity effects versus controls in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (decreased) and precuneus (enhanced) within the right ATT/WM network. The dorsal attentional network had a decreased connectivity with the DMN and EXN in bvFTD versus controls, and a decreased connectivity with the DSN versus pAD. CONCLUSIONS: RSN functional abnormalities occur in bvFTD, involving not only the salience network, but also the DMN and fronto-parietal network associated with ATT and WM modulation. The pattern of functional changes differs from that seen in pAD. The altered interactions among RSN observed in bvFTD and pAD may provide a new venue to explore the functional correlates of cognitive abnormalities in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders",

    abstract = "Based on lesion mapping studies, the inferior parietal lobule and temporoparietal junction are considered the critical parietal regions for spatial-attentional deficits. Lesion evidence for a key role of the intraparietal sulcus, a region featuring prominently in non-human primate studies and human functional imaging studies of the intact brain, is still lacking, probably due to the exceptional nature of isolated intraparietal sulcus lesions. We combined behavioural testing and functional imaging in two patients with a focal intraparietal sulcus lesion sparing the inferior parietal lobule and temporoparietal junction to examine the critical contribution of the intraparietal sulcus to spatial attention. Case H.H. had a focal ischaemic lesion (1.8 cm3) that was confined to the posterior segment of the left intraparietal sulcus, whereas Case N.V. had a partially reversible lesion of the middle segment of the right intraparietal sulcus extending into the superior parietal lobule (13.8 cm3). The performance of these cases was contrasted with five cases with a classical inferior parietal lesion, as well as with a group of 31 age-matched controls. In the behavioural study, the patients performed an orientation discrimination task on a peripheral target (eccentricity 7.6°) that was preceded by a central spatial cue. We manipulated both the cue validity (17\% trials with an invalid spatial cue) and the presence of a competing distracter in the visual field contralateral to the target (17\% double stimulation trials). The ability of the patients with an intraparietal sulcus lesion to reorient their spatial focus of attention and to select between competing stimuli was impaired for contralesional targets compared with controls, similarly to what we saw in the inferior parietal group. Furthermore, we could observe that the deficit in Case N.V. resolved with regression of the lesion. To further evaluate the correspondence between spatial-attentional deficits and the intraparietal sulcus lesions, we ascertained the functional integrity of the inferior parietal lobule and temporoparietal junction in Case H.H. using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same task as in the behavioural study. The intraparietal sulcus lesion of this patient did not affect the task-related activation of the inferior parietal lobule or temporoparietal junction. Additionally, a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study in Case H.H. and 62 controls revealed that the lesion in Case H.H. did not affect the topology of the ventral attention network nor the strength of its main inter- and intrahemispheric connections. Our findings demonstrate that the human superior parietal cortex critically contributes to spatially selective attention.",

RS fMRI data were analyzed using both independent component analysis (ICA) and a seed correlation analysis, starting from the hypothalamus and the thalamus. RESULTS: The seed correlation analysis revealed increased functional connectivity within the networks identified starting from the hypothalami and thalami in CH patients versus controls. ICA analysis detected 11 RSNs with potential functional relevance. Among these networks, CH patients had decreased fluctuations within the sensorimotor and the primary visual network compared to controls (P-values 0.03-0.007). RSN abnormalities were significantly correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: In CH patients a diffuse abnormality of brain functional connectivity is present, which extends beyond the antinoceptive system.",

In simulation, the advantages of such modern methods are readily demonstrable. However quantitative empirical validation remains elusive in vivo as the true connectivity patterns are unknown and noise/artifact distributions are challenging to characterize with high fidelity. Recent innovations in capturing finite sample behavior of asymptotically consistent estimators (i.e., SIMulation and EXtrapolation - SIMEX) have enabled direct estimation of bias given single datasets. Herein, we leverage the theoretical core of SIMEX to study the properties of inference methods in the face of diminishing data (in contrast to increasing noise). The stability of inference methods with respect to synthetic loss of empirical data (defined as resilience) is used to quantify the empirical performance of one inference method relative to another. We illustrate this new approach in a comparison of ordinary and robust inference methods with rs-fMRI",

ALS patients versus controls showed a significantly increased functional connectivity between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum-crus II. No right SMC connectivity changes were found. The pattern of increased functional connectivity to the left SMC was more widespread when considering only patients with no CST DT MRI abnormalities than the whole group of patients. In this patient group, functional connectivity was also increased between the right SMC and the right parahippocampal gyrus. On the contrary, in ALS patients with CST damage (as assessed using DT MRI) versus controls, functional connectivity was increased between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex only, while it was decreased between the right SMC and the right cerebellum-lobule VI. In ALS patients, disease severity correlated with reduced SMC functional connectivity. Functional brain changes do occur in ALS with mild disability. These changes might have a role in compensating for (limited) structural damage and might exhaust with increasing burden of disease pathology",

Functional MRI (fMRI) is an important research method for investigating the neuroanatomic substrates of cognitive disorders and their treatment. Surprisingly, however, relatively little research has utilized fMRI to examine alterations in brain functioning after mTBI. This article provides a critical overview of the published fMRI research on mTBI to date. These topics include examination of frontal lobe/executive functions such as working memory, as well as episodic memory and resting state/functional connectivity. mTBI has also been investigated in military populations where studies have focused on effects of blast injury and comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Finally, we address fMRI evaluations of response to behavioral or pharmacological challenges and interventions targeting cognitive and behavioral sequelae of mTBI. The review concludes with identification and discussion of gaps in current knowledge and future directions for fMRI studies of mTBI. The authors conclude that fMRI in combination with related methods can be expected to play an increasing role in research related to studies of pathophysiological mechanisms of the sequelae of mTBI as well as in diagnosis and treatment monitoring",

    abstract = "The present study investigates the effects of trait anxiety on the neural efficiency of working memory component functions (manipulation vs. maintenance) in the absence of threat-related stimuli. For the manipulation of affectively neutral verbal information held in working memory, high- and low-anxious individuals (N = 46) did not differ in their behavioral performance, yet trait anxiety was positively related to the neural effort expended on task processing, as measured by BOLD signal changes in fMRI. Higher levels of anxiety were associated with stronger activation in two regions implicated in the goal-directed control of attention-that is, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior frontal sulcus-and with stronger deactivation in a region assigned to the brain's default-mode network-that is, rostral-ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, anxiety was associated with a stronger functional coupling of right DLPFC with ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. We interpret our findings as reflecting reduced processing efficiency in high-anxious individuals and point out the need to consider measures of functional integration in addition to measures of regional activation strength when investigating individual differences in neural efficiency. With respect to the functions of working memory, we conclude that anxiety specifically impairs the processing efficiency of (control-demanding) manipulation processes (as opposed to mere maintenance). Notably, this study contributes to an accumulating body of evidence showing that anxiety also affects cognitive processing in the absence of threat-related stimuli",

    abstract = "An adaptive spatial filtering method is proposed that takes into account contextual information in fMRI activation detection. This filter replaces the time series of each voxel with a weighted average of time series of a small neighborhood around it. The filter coefficients at each voxel are derived so as to maximize a test statistic designed to indicate the presence of activation. This statistic is the ratio of the energy of the filtered time series in a signal subspace to the energy of the residuals. It is shown that the filter coefficients and the maximum energy ratio can be found through a generalized eigenproblem. This approach equates the filter coefficients to the elements of an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a specific matrix, while the largest eigenvalue itself becomes the maximum energy ratio that can be used as a statistic for detecting activation. The distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis is derived by a nonparametric permutation technique in the wavelet domain. Also, in this paper we introduce a new set of basis vectors that define the signal subspace. The space spanned by these basis vectors covers a wide range of possible hemodynamic response functions (HRF) and is applicable to both event related and block design fMRI signal analysis. This approach circumvents the need for a priori assumptions about the exact shape of the HRF. Resting-state experimental fMRI data were used to assess the specificity of the method, showing that the actual false-alarm rate of the proposed method is equal or less than its expected value. Analysis of simulated data and motor task fMRI datasets from six volunteers using the method proposed here showed an improved sensitivity as compared to a conventional test with a similar statistic applied to spatially smoothed data.",

The neural substrates associated with this condition, both from structural and functional perspectives, are not yet well established. Recent studies have highlighted the relevance of neuroimaging not only to provide a more solid understanding about the disorder but also for possible clinical support. The ADHD-200 Consortium organized the ADHD-200 global competition making publicly available, hundreds of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) datasets of both ADHD patients and typically developing (TD) controls for research use. In the current study, we evaluate the predictive power of a set of three different feature extraction methods and 10 different pattern recognition methods. The features tested were regional homogeneity (ReHo), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and independent components analysis maps (resting state networks; RSN). Our findings suggest that the combination ALFF+ReHo maps contain relevant information to discriminate ADHD patients from TD controls, but with limited accuracy. All classifiers provided almost the same performance in this case. In addition, the combination ALFF+ReHo+RSN was relevant in combined vs. inattentive ADHD classification, achieving a score accuracy of 67\%. In this latter case, the performances of the classifiers were not equivalent and L2-regularized logistic regression (both in primal and dual space) provided the most accurate predictions. The analysis of brain regions containing most discriminative information suggested that in both classifications (ADHD vs. TD controls and combined vs. inattentive), the relevant information is not confined only to a small set of regions but it is spatially distributed across the whole brain",

Method First-episode, treatment-naive patients with schizophrenia (FES) (n=115) and healthy controls (n=113) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and neurocognitive tests. Intrinsic neural activities evaluated by using the fragment amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and the resting-state functional connectivity assessed by seed-based correlational analysis were compared between patients and controls. Aberrant intrinsic activities and DMN connectivity in patients were then correlated to neurocognitive performance and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with FES showed decreased fALFF in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and increased fALFF in the bilateral putamen. Increased functional connectivity with the DMN was observed in the left insula and bilateral dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) in patients with FES. In patients, aberrant fALFF in the bilateral OFC were correlated with cognitive processing speed; fALFF in the left OFC and right putamen were correlated with the clinical factors excited/activation and disorganization; and increased DMN functional connectivity in the left insula was correlated with the clinical factors positive, excited/activation, disorganization and neurocognitive deficit in the domain of sustained attention. CONCLUSIONS: These associations between neurocognitive dysfunction and aberrant intrinsic activities, and also functional connectivity, of the DMN in patients with schizophrenia may provide important insights into the neural mechanism of the disease",

Although information regarding BOLD-BOLD synchrony between different regions is frequently reported, the relationship between spontaneous activity and behavioral state, and the association of spontaneous signal synchrony and evoked response, are less well characterized. The purpose of this study is to exploit the higher signal-to-noise ratio and in turn available spatial resolution at 7.0 T to understand the relationship between synchrony, measured as Pearson's R value, and amplitude, measured as signal standard deviation over time, in sensorimotor cortex for four separate behavioral states: eyes closed resting (EC), eyes open fixation (EO), EO with constant right hand fist clench (EO-F) and EO with 6 s off/6 s on (0.083 Hz) right hand finger tapping (EO-T). BOLD (TE/TR = 25/3,000 ms; 100 time points) scans were performed in healthy volunteers (7.0 T; 4 M/3 F; right-handed) at high spatial resolution = 1.6 × 1.6 × 1.6 mm3 . Results (z > 5; P < 0.05; low-pass filtering <0.067 Hz) reveal that synchrony is highest in the EC state (R = 0.35 ± 0.07) and reduces for EO (R = 0.26 ± 0.07), EO-F (R = 0.23 ± 0.07; P < 0.05), and EO-T (R = 0.12 ± 0.04; P < 0.05) conditions. Amplitude was highest in the EC condition and only reduced significantly (P < 0.05) for the EO-T condition. Synchrony within sensorimotor cortex correlated with evoked finger-tapping response magnitude (R = 0.81; P = 0.03), suggesting that spontaneous signal synchrony may be a predictor of evoked BOLD response magnitude and may account for intersubject variability in sensorimotor cortex",

    abstract = "The change in cerebral rate of oxidative metabolism (CMR(O(2))) during neural activation may be estimated from blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and arterial spin-labeling (ASL) fMRI measurements. The established method relies on an epoch of iso-metabolic blood flow increase, typically induced by CO2 breathing, to calibrate the BOLD-CBF relationship at resting-state CMR(O2). Here, we discuss the systematic bias in CMR(O2)-CBF data that can be introduced depending on the value derived for the calibration constant (M) from the CO2 breathing epoch. We demonstrate that the fidelity of BOLD-CBF data acquired during the neural activation task have low impact on the tightness of CMR(O2)-CBF coupling, as well as the coupling slope, when the derived calibration value is of a relatively moderate amplitude (M in the range of, or greater than, 10-15 at 1.5 T). Via the standard reformulation of a grid in BOLD-CBF space into the CMR(O2)-CBF plane, we demonstrate the non-linear transformation that takes place and the sources of systematic bias that result. We find that the outcome of a neurovascular coupling study may be predicted to a large extent purely from the value of the calibration constant, M, that is used. Our results suggest that the accurate determination of M is of greater importance than thought previously and indicate that BOLD-CBF data must always be supplied when considering CMR(O2)-CBF behavior in a particular brain region.",

    abstract = "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state temporal correlations (RSTC) are two leading techniques for investigating the connectivity of the human brain. They have been widely used to investigate the strength of anatomical and functional connections between distant brain regions in healthy subjects, and in clinical populations. Though they are both based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they have not yet been compared directly. In this work both techniques were employed to create global connectivity matrices covering the whole brain gray matter. This allowed for direct comparisons between functional connectivity measured by RSTC with anatomical connectivity quantified using DTI tractography. We found that connectivity matrices obtained using both techniques showed significant agreement. Connectivity maps created for a priori defined anatomical regions showed significant correlation, and furthermore agreement was especially high in regions showing strong overall connectivity, such as those belonging to the default mode network. Direct comparison between functional RSTC and anatomical DTI connectivity, presented here for the first time, links two powerful approaches for investigating brain connectivity and shows their strong agreement. It provides a crucial multi-modal validation for resting state correlations as representing neuronal connectivity. The combination of both techniques presented here allows for further combining them to provide richer representation of brain connectivity both in the healthy brain and in clinical conditions",

However, there lacks a meso-time-scale network to bridge the ICN and SCN and get insights of brain functional organization. Methodology and Principal Findings: We proposed a functional covariance network (FCN) method by measuring the covariance of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in BOLD signals across subjects, and compared the patterns of ALFF-FCNs with the TS-ICNs and SCNs by mapping the brain networks of default network, task-positive network and sensory networks. We demonstrated large overlap among FCNs, ICNs and SCNs and modular nature in FCNs and ICNs by using conjunctional analysis. Most interestingly, FCN analysis showed a network dichotomy consisting of anti-correlated high-level cognitive system and low-level perceptive system, which is a novel finding different from the ICN dichotomy consisting of the default-mode network and the task-positive network. Conclusion: The current study proposed an ALFF-FCN approach to measure the interregional correlation of brain activity responding to short periods of state, and revealed novel organization patterns of resting-state brain activity from an intermediate time scale. © 2011 Zhang et al.",

Little is known, so far, about the changes in the spontaneous brain activity in LLD during the resting state. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous neural activity in first-episode, treatment-naive patients with LLD by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: A novel analytical method, coherence-based regional homogeneity (Cohe-ReHo), was used to assess regional spontaneous neural activity during the resting state in 15 first-episode, treatment-naive patients with LLD and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared to the healthy controls, the LLD group showed significantly decreased Cohe-ReHo in left caudate nucleus, right anterior cingulate gyrus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right angular gyrus, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, and right precuneus, while significantly increased Cohe-ReHo in left cerebellum posterior lobe, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral supplementary motor area, and right postcentral gyrus (p<0.005, corrected for multiple comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated abnormal spontaneous neural activity was distributed extensively in first-episode, treatment-naive patients with LLD during the resting state.

In particular, it was proposed that there exists two systems in the brain that are intrinsically organized into anticorrelated networks, the default mode network, which usually exhibits task-related deactivations, and the task-positive network, which usually exhibits task-related activations during tasks that demands external attention. However, it is currently under debate whether the anticorrelations observed in resting state fMRI were valid or were instead artificially introduced by global signal regression, a common preprocessing technique to remove physiological and other noise in resting-state fMRI signal. We examined positive and negative correlations in resting-state connectivity using two different preprocessing methods: a component base noise reduction method (CompCor, Behzadi et al., 2007), in which principal components from noise regions-of-interest were removed, and the global signal regression method. Robust anticorrelations between a default mode network seed region in the medial prefrontal cortex and regions of the task-positive network were observed under both methods. Specificity of the anticorrelations was similar between the two methods. Specificity and sensitivity for positive correlations were higher under CompCor compared to the global regression method. Our results suggest that anticorrelations observed in resting-state connectivity are not an artifact introduced by global signal regression and might have biological origins, and that the CompCor method can be used to examine valid anticorrelations during rest",

    abstract = "A common pre-processing challenge associated with group level fMRI analysis is spatial registration of multiple subjects to a standard space. Spatial normalization, using a reference image such as the Montreal Neurological Institute brain template, is the most common technique currently in use to achieve spatial congruence across multiple subjects. This method corrects for global shape differences preserving regional asymmetries, but does not account for functional differences. We propose a novel approach to co-register task-based fMRI data using resting state group-ICA networks. We posit that these intrinsic networks (INs) can provide to the spatial normalization process with important information about how each individual's brain is organized functionally. The algorithm is initiated by the extraction of single subject representations of INs using group level independent component analysis (ICA) on resting state fMRI data. In this proof-of-concept work two of the robust, commonly identified, networks are chosen as functional templates. As an estimation step, the relevant INs are utilized to derive a set of normalization parameters for each subject. Finally, the normalization parameters are applied individually to a different set of fMRI data acquired while the subjects performed an auditory oddball task. These normalization parameters, although derived using rest data, generalize successfully to data obtained with a cognitive paradigm for each subject. The improvement in results is verified using two widely applied fMRI analysis methods: the general linear model and ICA. Resulting activation patterns from each analysis method show significant improvements in terms of detection sensitivity and statistical significance at the group level. The results presented in this article provide initial evidence to show that common functional domains from the resting state brain may be used to improve the group statistics of task-fMRI data. © 2011 Khullar, Michael, Cahill, Kiehl, Pearlson, Baum and Calhoun.",

Group comparisons were carried out controlling for age, gender, hippocampal volume and brain volume. The strength of functional connectivity in each region also was correlated with neuropsychological measures. We found that the hippocampus can be segmented into three distinct functional subregions (head, body, and tail), according to the relative connectivity with PFC, PCC and thalamus, respectively. The AD group showed stronger hippocampus-PFC and weaker hippocampus-PCC functional connectivity, the magnitudes of which correlated with MMSE in both cases. The results are consistent with an adaptive role of the PFC in the context of progression of dysfunction in PCC during earlier stages of AD. Extension of our approach could integrate regional volume measures for the hippocampus with their functional connectivity patterns in ways that should increase sensitivity for assessment of AD onset and progression",

Recent emergence of advanced network analysis techniques utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has made the understanding of neurological disorders more comprehensively at a whole-brain connectivity level. However, inferring effective brain connectivity from fMRI data is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to obtain good control-patient classification performance. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling can potentially produce results that are biologically more meaningful since most biologically networks are formed by a relatively few number of connections. However, this constraint, when applied at an individual level, will degrade classification performance due to inter-subject variability. To address this problem, we consider a constrained sparse linear regression model associated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Specifically, we introduced sparsity into brain connectivity via l1-norm penalization, and ensured consistent non-zero connections across subjects via l2-norm penalization. Our results demonstrate that the constrained sparse network gives better classification performance than the conventional correlation-based network, indicating its greater sensitivity to early stage brain pathologies",

Given that the large-scale organization of functional networks is determined by the temporal relationships between brain regions, the structural limitations may extend to the global characteristics of functional networks. Here, we explored the extent to which the functional network community structure is determined by the underlying anatomical architecture. We directly compared macaque (Macaca fascicularis) functional connectivity (FC) assessed using spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) to directed anatomical connectivity derived from macaque axonal tract tracing studies. Consistent with previous reports, FC increased with increasing strength of anatomical connection, and FC was also present between regions that had no direct anatomical connection. We observed moderate similarity between the FC of each region and its anatomical connectivity. Notably, anatomical connectivity patterns, as described by structural motifs, were different within and across functional modules: partitioning of the functional network was supported by dense bidirectional anatomical connections within clusters and unidirectional connections between clusters. Together, our data directly demonstrate that the FC patterns observed in resting-state BOLD-fMRI are dictated by the underlying neuroanatomical architecture. Importantly, we show how this architecture contributes to the global organizational principles of both functional specialization and integration",

    abstract = {Networks of brain regions having synchronized fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) time-series at rest, or "resting state networks" (RSNs), are emerging as a basis for understanding intrinsic brain activity. RSNs are topographically consistent with activity-related networks subserving sensory, motor, and cognitive processes, and studying their spontaneous fluctuations following acute drug challenge may provide a way to understand better the neuroanatomical substrates of drug action. The present within-subject double-blind study used BOLD fMRI at 3T to investigate the functional networks influenced by the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem (Ambien®). Zolpidem is a positive modulator of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors, and engenders sedative effects that may be explained in part by how it modulates intrinsic brain activity. Healthy participants (n= 12) underwent fMRI scanning 45 min after acute oral administration of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg), and changes in BOLD signal were measured while participants gazed at a static fixation point (i.e., at rest). Data were analyzed using group independent component analysis (ICA) with dual regression and results indicated that compared to placebo, the highest dose of zolpidem increased functional connectivity within a number of sensory, motor, and limbic networks. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an increase in functional connectivity at rest following administration of the positive GABA(A) receptor modulators midazolam and alcohol, and suggest that investigating how zolpidem modulates intrinsic brain activity may have implications for understanding the etiology of its powerful sedative effects},

    abstract = {Self-recognition has been demonstrated by a select number of primate species and is often used as an index of self-awareness. Whether a specialized neural mechanism for self-face recognition in humans exists remains unclear. We used event-related fMRI to investigate brain regions selectively activated by images of one's own face. Ten right-handed normal subjects viewed digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched familiar other presented in a random sequence. Subjects were instructed to press a button with the right hand if the image looked like their own face, and another button if it looked like a familiar or scrambled face. Contrasting the trials in which images contain more "self" with those containing more familiar "other" revealed signal changes in the right hemisphere (RH) including the inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. The opposite contrast revealed voxels with higher signal intensity for images of "other" than for "self" in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Additional contrasts against baseline revealed that activity in the "self" minus "other" contrasts represent signal increases compared to baseline (null events) in "self" trials, while activity in the "other" minus "self" contrasts represent deactivations relative to baseline during "self" trials. Thus, a unique network involving frontoparietal structures described as part of the "mirror neuron system" in the RH underlies self-face recognition, while regions comprising the "default/resting state" network deactivate less for familiar others. We provide a model that reconciles these findings and previously published work to account for the modulations in these two networks previously implicated in social cognition.},

METHODS:Ten healthy participants were examined with the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fM-RI). The scanning includes the resting state 1 (R 1), acupuncture stimulating (AP) Neiguan (PC 6) and the resting state 2 (R 2). All data were analyzed with the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). RESULTS:1) During the R1, the regions with active signal on the ALFF contained bilateral superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and some part of cerebellum (including right declive, culme, tonsil and left uvula), as well as left precuneus, right superiour temporal gyrus. 2) As for AP, the active regions with higher ALFF were bilateral superior frontal gyrus and right cuneus, as well as left middle frontal gyrus, declivis and right semi-lunar lobule. 3) The main difference on ALFF between R1 and AP appeared within bilateral cingulated gyrus and declivis, left lingualgurus, and cuneus, as well as right precuneus, fusiform gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, etc. CONCLUSION:After acupuncture stimulating the left Neiguan (PC 6), the active regions on ALFF are detected on bilateral cingulated gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus, as well as bilateral declivis and left lingual gurus, etc. These regions have the close relationship with the mental disorder and nervous diseases, which might be the possible neural mechanism of acupuncture stimulating Neiguan (PC 6) for treating some of related mental disorder and nervous diseases.",

    abstract = "In the past decade, resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) measures of brain activity have attracted considerable attention. Based on changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, R-fMRI offers a novel way to assess the brain's spontaneous or intrinsic (i.e., task-free) activity with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. The properties of both the intra- and inter-regional connectivity of resting-state brain activity have been well documented, promoting our understanding of the brain as a complex network. Specifically, the topological organization of brain networks has been recently studied with graph theory. In this review, we will summarize the recent advances in graph-based brain network analyses of R-fMRI signals, both in typical and atypical populations. Application of these approaches to R-fMRI data has demonstrated non-trivial topological properties of functional networks in the human brain. Among these is the knowledge that the brain's intrinsic activity is organized as a small-world, highly efficient network, with significant modularity and highly connected hub regions. These network properties have also been found to change throughout normal development, aging, and in various pathological conditions. The literature reviewed here suggests that graph-based network analyses are capable of uncovering system-level changes associated with different processes in the resting brain, which could provide novel insights into the understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of brain function. We also highlight several potential research topics in the future.",

A similar approach is used in this work to study a group of chronic back pain patients and healthy controls to determine the impact of long enduring pain over brain dynamics. Correlation networks were constructed from the mutual partial correlations of brain activity's time series selected from ninety regions using a well validated brain parcellation atlas. The study of the resulting networks revealed an organization of up to six communities with similar modularity in both groups, but with important differences in the membership of key communities of frontal and temporal regions. The bulk of these findings were confirmed by a surprisingly naive analysis based on the pairwise correlations of the strongest and weakest correlated healthy regions. Beside confirming the brain effects of long enduring pain, these results provide a framework to study the effect of other chronic conditions over cortical function.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), the most common type of focal epilepsy in adults, is often caused by hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patients with HS usually present memory dysfunction, which is material-specific according to the hemisphere involved and has been correlated to the degree of HS as measured by postoperative histopathology as well as by the degree of hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Verbal memory is mostly affected by left-sided HS, whereas visuo-spatial memory is more affected by right HS. Some of these impairments may be related to abnormalities of the network in which individual hippocampus takes part. Functional connectivity can play an important role to understand how the hippocampi interact with other brain areas. It can be estimated via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) resting state experiments by evaluating patterns of functional networks. In this study, we investigated the functional connectivity patterns of 9 control subjects, 9 patients with right MTLE and 9 patients with left MTLE. RESULTS: We detected differences in functional connectivity within and between hippocampi in patients with unilateral MTLE associated with ipsilateral HS by resting state fMRI. Functional connectivity resulted to be more impaired ipsilateral to the seizure focus in both patient groups when compared to control subjects. This effect was even more pronounced for the left MTLE group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here suggest that left HS causes more reduction of functional connectivity than right HS in subjects with left hemisphere dominance for language.",

    abstract = {Brain activity is continuously modulated, even at "rest". The alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz) has been known as the hallmark of the brain's idle-state. However, it is still debated if the alpha rhythm reflects synchronization in a distributed network or focal generator and whether it occurs spontaneously or is driven by a stimulus. This EEG/fMRI study aimed to explore the source of alpha modulations and their distribution in the resting brain. By serendipity, while computing the individually defined power modulations of the alpha-band, two simultaneously occurring components of these modulations were found. An 'induced alpha' that was correlated with the paradigm (eyes open/ eyes closed), and a 'spontaneous alpha' that was on-going and unrelated to the paradigm. These alpha components when used as regressors for BOLD activation revealed two segregated activation maps: the 'induced map' included left lateral temporal cortical regions and the hippocampus; the 'spontaneous map' included prefrontal cortical regions and the thalamus. Our combined fMRI/EEG approach allowed to computationally untangle two parallel patterns of alpha modulations and underpin their anatomical basis in the human brain. These findings suggest that the human alpha rhythm represents at least two simultaneously occurring processes which characterize the 'resting brain'; one is related to expected change in sensory information, while the other is endogenous and independent of stimulus change.},

    abstract = {MR-based brain imaging technologies provide a suite of functional and structural metrics that can be used to test hypotheses about the CNS mechanisms underlying pain perception and chronification, from a cellular level to a systems level. Two types of functional MRI discussed in this review provide insight into pain mechanisms: stimulus-evoked fMRI and task-free ("resting state") fMRI. The former can assess how the brain responds to noxious or non-noxious stimuli normally or in a chronic pain state as a window into understanding pain, hyperalgesia and allodynia. The latter can assess functional connectivity reflecting synchronous ultra-slow frequency oscillation between brain areas. This provides insight into how brain areas work together as networks to produce pain and how these networks may be modified due to chronic pain. Perfusion MR (e.g., arterial spin labeling) can also provide task-free information pertaining to ongoing brain activity that may reflect spontaneous (ongoing) chronic pain. Structural MR techniques can be used to delineate gray and white matter abnormalities and markers of neuroinflammation associated with chronic pains. Functional and structural MRI findings point to brain and peripheral nerve abnormalities in patients with chronic pain, some of which are pre-existing and others that develop with prolonged pain (and related neuroinflammation) over time. Recent studies indicate that some structural brain abnormalities associated with chronic pain are reversible following effective pain treatment. These data together with findings from studies of individual differences suggest that some chronic pains arise from a combination of pre-existing vulnerabilities and sustained abnormal input},

Results: The average resting-state functional connectivity (FC) score between the left and right auditory cortical regions was significantly lower in tinnitus patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Direct comparison between patients and controls showed that increased functional connectivity caused by tinnitus occurred predominantly in the left amygdala and in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.

    abstract = "PURPOSE: To examine the functional and anatomical connectivity of the cerebellum and their relationship in schizophrenia through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten subjects with schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI and DTI. Left and right cerebellar seed regions were used in a voxel-wise functional connectivity analysis of the cerebellum. Fractional anisotropy (FA) was measured to assess white matter integrity of the middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) and superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP). Differences in functional connectivity and FA values between the two groups were determined by two-sample t-tests. The relationship between functional connectivity and FA values in both groups were assessed using Pearson s correlation. RESULTS: Decreased functional connectivity to the left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral middle cingulate cortex, right paracentral lobule, right thalamus, and bilateral cerebellum were found in subjects with schizophrenia when compared to healthy controls; while decreased FA values in the left SCP were found in subjects with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Significant correlation was observed between the functional connectivity of the left cerebellum-right paracentral lobule and right cerebellum-right thalamus and the FA values of the MCP in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Findings of this multi-modal imaging study support functional and anatomical connectivity abnormalities and the role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia. They also indicate the need for further investigation regarding the relationship between functional and anatomical connectivity and its role in neuropathophysiology. J. Magn. Reson.

While the physiological origins of this correlation remain unclear, its existence may have a practical application in minimizing the background physiological noise present in BOLD-fMRI recordings. We performed simultaneous, resting-state fMRI and 28-channel NIRS in seven adult subjects in order to assess the utility of NIRS signals in the regression of physiological noise from fMRI data. We calculated the variance of the residual error in a general linear model of the baseline fMRI signal, and the reduction of this variance achieved by including NIRS signals in the model. In addition, we introduced a sequence of simulated hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) into the resting-state fMRI data of each subject in order to quantify the effectiveness of NIRS signals in optimizing the recovery of that HRF. For comparison, these calculations were also performed using a pulse and respiration RETROICOR model. Our results show that the use of 10 or more NIRS channels can reduce variance in the residual error by as much as 36\% on average across the whole cortex. However the same number of low-pass filtered white noise regressors is shown to produce a reduction of 19\%. The RETROICOR model obtained a variance reduction of 6.4\%. Our HRF simulation showed that the mean-squared error (MSE) between the recovered and true HRFs is reduced by 21\% on average when 10 NIRS channels are applied and by introducing an optimized time lag between the NIRS and fMRI time series, a single NIRS channel can provide an average MSE reduction of 14\%. The RETROICOR model did not provide a significant change in MSE. By each of the metrics calculated, NIRS recording is shown to be of significant benefit to the regression of low-frequency physiological noise from fMRI data",

    abstract = "Traumatic brain injury often results in cognitive impairments that limit recovery. The underlying pathophysiology of these impairments is uncertain, which restricts clinical assessment and management. Here, we use magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypotheses that: (i) traumatic brain injury results in abnormalities of functional connectivity within key cognitive networks; (ii) these changes are correlated with cognitive performance; and (iii) functional connectivity within these networks is influenced by underlying changes in structural connectivity produced by diffuse axonal injury. We studied 20 patients in the chronic phase after traumatic brain injury compared with age-matched controls. Network function was investigated in detail using functional magnetic resonance imaging to analyse both regional brain activation, and the interaction of brain regions within a network (functional connectivity). We studied patients during performance of a simple choice-reaction task and at 'rest'. Since functional connectivity reflects underlying structural connectivity, diffusion tensor imaging was used to quantify axonal injury, and test whether structural damage correlated with functional change. The patient group showed typical impairments in information processing and attention, when compared with age-matched controls. Patients were able to perform the task accurately, but showed slow and variable responses. Brain regions activated by the task were similar between the groups, but patients showed greater deactivation within the default mode network, in keeping with an increased cognitive load. A multivariate analysis of 'resting' state functional magnetic resonance imaging was then used to investigate whether changes in network function were present in the absence of explicit task performance. Overall, default mode network functional connectivity was increased in the patient group. Patients with the highest functional connectivity had the least cognitive impairment. In addition, functional connectivity at rest also predicted patterns of brain activation during later performance of the task. As expected, patients showed widespread white matter damage compared with controls. Lower default mode network functional connectivity was seen in those patients with more evidence of diffuse axonal injury within the adjacent corpus callosum. Taken together, our results demonstrate altered patterns of functional connectivity in cognitive networks following injury. The results support a direct relationship between white matter organization within the brain's structural core, functional connectivity within the default mode network and cognitive function following brain injury. They can be explained by two related changes: a compensatory increase in functional connectivity within the default mode network; and a variable degree of structural disconnection that modulates this change in network function.",

    abstract = "Schizophrenia has been increasingly conceptualized as a disorder of brain connectivity, in large part due to findings emerging from white matter and functional connectivity (FC) studies. This work has focused primarily on within-hemispheric connectivity, however some evidence has suggested abnormalities in callosal structure and interhemispheric interaction. Here we examined functional connectivity between homotopic points in the brain using a technique called voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). We performed VMHC analyses on resting state fMRI data from 23 healthy controls and 25 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. We found highly significant reductions in VMHC in patients for a number of regions, particularly the occipital lobe, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. No regions of increased VMHC were detected in patients. VMHC in the postcentral gyrus extending into the precentral gyrus was correlated with PANSS Total scores. These results show substantial impairment of interhemispheric coordination in schizophrenia",

    abstract = {Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for insomnia, depression, and anxiety consisting of pulsed, low-intensity current applied to the earlobes or scalp. Despite empirical evidence of clinical efficacy, its mechanism of action is largely unknown. The goal was to characterize the acute effects of CES on resting state brain activity. Our primary hypothesis was that CES would result in deactivation in cortical and subcortical regions. Eleven healthy controls were administered CES applied to the earlobes at subsensory thresholds while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging in the resting state. We tested 0.5- and 100-Hz stimulation, using blocks of 22 sec "on" alternating with 22 sec of baseline (device was "off"). The primary outcome measure was differences in blood oxygen level dependent data associated with the device being on versus baseline. The secondary outcome measures were the effects of stimulation on connectivity within the default mode, sensorimotor, and fronto-parietal networks. Both 0.5- and 100-Hz stimulation resulted in significant deactivation in midline frontal and parietal regions. 100-Hz stimulation was associated with both increases and decreases in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN). Results suggest that CES causes cortical brain deactivation, with a similar pattern for high- and low-frequency stimulation, and alters connectivity in the DMN. These effects may result from interference from high- or low-frequency noise. Small perturbations of brain oscillations may therefore have significant effects on normal resting state brain activity. These results provide insight into the mechanism of action of CES, and may assist in the future development of optimal parameters for effective treatment},

    abstract = "Reflecting one's mental self is a fundamental process for evaluating the personal relevance of life events and for moral decision making and future envisioning. Although the corresponding network has been receiving growing attention, the driving neurochemical mechanisms of the default mode network (DMN) remain unknown. Here we combined positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate modulations of the DMN via serotonin-1A receptors (5-HT(1A)), separated for 5-HT autoinhibition (dorsal raphe nucleus) and local inhibition (heteroreceptors in projection areas). Using two independent approaches, regional 5-HT(1A) binding consistently predicted DMN activity in the retrosplenial cortex for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Tower of London task. On the other hand, both local and autoinhibitory 5-HT(1A) binding inversely modulated the posterior cingulate cortex, the strongest hub in the resting human brain. In the frontal part of the DMN, a negative association was found between the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and local 5-HT(1A) inhibition. Our results indicate a modulation of key areas involved in self-referential processing by serotonergic neurotransmission, whereas variations in 5-HT(1A) binding explained a considerable amount of the individual variability in the DMN. Moreover, the brain regions associated with distinct introspective functions seem to be specifically regulated by the different 5-HT(1A) binding sites. Together with previously reported modulations of dopamine and GABA, this regional specialization suggests complex interactions of several neurotransmitters driving the default mode network",

    abstract = {The underlying functional neuroanatomy of tinnitus remains poorly understood. Few studies have focused on functional cerebral connectivity changes in tinnitus patients. The aim of this study was to test if functional MRI "resting-state" connectivity patterns in auditory network differ between tinnitus patients and normal controls. Thirteen chronic tinnitus subjects and fifteen age-matched healthy controls were studied on a 3 tesla MRI. Connectivity was investigated using independent component analysis and an automated component selection approach taking into account the spatial and temporal properties of each component. Connectivity in extra-auditory regions such as brainstem, basal ganglia/NAc, cerebellum, parahippocampal, right prefrontal, parietal, and sensorimotor areas was found to be increased in tinnitus subjects. The right primary auditory cortex, left prefrontal, left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral occipital regions showed a decreased connectivity in tinnitus. These results show that there is a modification of cortical and subcortical functional connectivity in tinnitus encompassing attentional, mnemonic, and emotional networks. Our data corroborate the hypothesized implication of non-auditory regions in tinnitus physiopathology and suggest that various regions of the brain seem involved in the persistent awareness of the phenomenon as well as in the development of the associated distress leading to disabling chronic tinnitus},

The present study employed a support vector machine-based MVPA approach to identify the complex patterns of sex differences in brain structure and resting-state function. We also aimed to assess the role of anatomy on functional sex differences during rest. One hundred and forty healthy young Chinese adults (70 men and 70 women) underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans. Gray matter density and regional homogeneity (ReHo) were used to map brain structure and resting-state function, respectively. After combining these two feature vectors into one union-vector, a pattern classifier was designed using principal component analysis and linear support vector machine to identify brain areas that had distinct characteristics between the groups. We found that: (1) male and female brains were different with a mean classification accuracy of 89\%; (2) sex differences in gray matter density were widely distributed in the brain, notably in the occipital lobe and the cerebellum; (3) men primarily showed higher ReHo in their right hemispheres and women tended to show greater ReHo in their left hemispheres; (4) about 50\% of brain areas with functional sex differences exhibited significant positive correlations between gray matter density and ReHo. Our results suggest that sex is an important factor that account for interindividual variability in the healthy brain. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

    abstract = "Concurrent EEG-fMRI studies have provided increasing details of the dynamics of intrinsic brain activity during the resting state. Here, we investigate a prominent effect in EEG during relaxed resting, i.e. the increase of the alpha power when the eyes are closed compared to when the eyes are open. This phenomenon is related to changes in thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical synchronization. In order to investigate possible changes to EEG-fMRI coupling and fMRI functional connectivity during the two states we adopted a data-driven approach that fuses the multimodal data on the basis of parallel ICA decompositions of the fMRI data in the spatial domain and of the EEG data in the spectral domain. The power variation of a posterior alpha component was used as a reference function to deconvolve the hemodynamic responses from occipital, frontal, temporal, and subcortical fMRI components. Additionally, we computed the functional connectivity between these components. The results showed widespread alpha hemodynamic responses and high functional connectivity during eyes-closed (EC) rest, while eyes open (EO) resting abolished many of the hemodynamic responses and markedly decreased functional connectivity. These data suggest that generation of local hemodynamic responses is highly sensitive to state changes that do not involve changes of mental effort or awareness. They also indicate the localized power differences in posterior alpha between EO and EC in resting state data are accompanied by spatially widespread amplitude changes in hemodynamic responses and inter-regional functional connectivity, i.e. low frequency hemodynamic signals display an equivalent of alpha reactivity.",

Data analysis approaches typically use averaging or linear regression to remove this physiological baseline with varying degrees of success. Biophysical model-based analysis of the functional hemodynamic response has also been advanced previously with the Balloon and Windkessel models. In the present work, a biophysical model of systemic and cerebral circulation and gas exchange is applied to resting state NIRS neuroimaging data from 10 human subjects. The model further includes dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which modulates the cerebral arteriole compliance to control cerebral blood flow. This biophysical model allows for prediction, from noninvasive blood pressure measurements, of the background hemodynamic fluctuations in the systemic and cerebral circulations. Significantly higher correlations with the NIRS data were found using the biophysical model predictions compared to blood pressure regression and compared to transfer function analysis (multifactor ANOVA, p<0.0001). This finding supports the further development and use of biophysical models for removing baseline activity in functional neuroimaging analysis. Future extensions of this work could model changes in cerebrovascular physiology that occur during development, aging, and disease.",

A statistically significant overlap between the resting-state functional connectivity map and the task-activation map due to bilateral finger tapping was obtained. Similar results have been obtained in the auditory and visual cortex. Because the pulse sequence used for collecting data was sensitive to blood flow and blood oxygenation, these low-frequency fluctuations of signal intensity may have arisen from variations of both. The objective of this study was simultaneously to determine the contribution of the blood oxygenation level signal and the flow signal to physiological fluctuations in the resting brain using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery pulse sequence. In all subjects, the functional connectivity maps obtained from BOLD had a greater coincidence with task-activation maps than the corresponding functional connectivity maps obtained from blood-flow signals at the same level of statistical significance. Results of this study suggest that while variations in blood flow might contribute to functional connectivity maps, BOLD signals play a dominant role in the mechanism that gives rise to functional connectivity in the resting human brain.",

We aimed to investigate how the cortical network reorganization is altered by frequent cortical overstimulation associated with migraine.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gray matter volumes and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging signal correlations were employed to construct structural and functional networks between brain regions in 43 female patients with migraine (PM) and 43 gender-matched healthy controls (HC) by using graph theory-based approaches. Compared with the HC group, the patients showed abnormal global topology in both structural and functional networks, characterized by higher mean clustering coefficients without significant change in the shortest absolute path length, which indicated that the PM lost optimal topological organization in their cortical networks. Brain hubs related to pain-processing revealed abnormal nodal centrality in both structural and functional networks, including the precentral gyrus, orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, temporal pole of the middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal gyrus. Negative correlations were found between migraine duration and regions with abnormal centrality. Furthermore, the dysfunctional connections in patients' cortical networks formed into a connected component and three dysregulated modules were identified involving pain-related information processing and motion-processing visual networks.CONCLUSIONS: Our results may reflect brain alteration dynamics resulting from migraine and suggest that long-term and high-frequency headache attacks may cause both structural and functional connectivity network reorganization.

However, there are considerable inconsistencies across studies in the methods used and the results observed, particularly between region-based and voxel-based brain networks. We constructed functional brain networks at multiple resolutions using the same resting-state fMRI data, and compared various network metrics, degree distribution, and localization of nodes of interest. It was found that the networks with higher resolutions exhibited the properties of small-world networks more prominently. It was also found that voxel-based networks were more robust against network fragmentation compared to region-based networks. Although the degree distributions of all networks followed an exponentially truncated power law rather than true power law, the higher the resolution, the closer the distribution was to a power law. The voxel-based analyses also enhanced visualization of the results in the 3D brain space. It was found that nodes with high connectivity tended have high efficiency, a co-localization of properties that was not as consistently observed in the region-based networks.

On the basis of evidence that negative interactions between frontal foci involved in cognitive control and the non-goal-directed "default-mode" network prevent attentional lapses, we hypothesized abnormalities in functional connectivity of these circuits in ADHD.METHODS: Resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were obtained at 3.0-Tesla in 20 adults with ADHD and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.RESULTS: Examination of healthy control subjects verified presence of an antiphasic or negative relationship between activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (centered at x = 8, y = 7, z = 38) and in default-mode network components. Group analyses revealed ADHD-related compromises in this relationship, with decreases in the functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex regions (p < .0004, corrected). Secondary analyses revealed an extensive pattern of ADHD-related decreases in connectivity between precuneus and other default-mode network components, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex (p < 3 x 10(-11), corrected) and portions of posterior cingulate (p < .02, corrected).CONCLUSIONS: Together with prior unbiased anatomic evidence of posterior volumetric abnormalities, our findings suggest that the long-range connections linking dorsal anterior cingulate to posterior cingulate and precuneus should be considered as a candidate locus of dysfunction in ADHD},

To date, however, it remains unknown whether and to what degree personality traits are associated with the randomness of resting-state temporal dynamics. To investigate this question, we estimated the Hurst exponent - a measure of the randomness of a time-series - during resting-state fMRI in brain areas previously associated with trait Impulsivity as defined in Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality in 15 healthy individuals. The Hurst exponent in the ventral striatum as well as in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was significantly associated with the measure of Gray's trait Impulsivity. Specifically, more random resting-state neural dynamics corresponded to higher Impulsivity scores both in the ventral striatum (r(15)=-.71; p=.003) and the OFC (r(15)=-.81; p<.001). In summary, we provide evidence for an association between individual differences in Gray's Impulsivity and randomness in key areas of the reward system which have previously been associated with this personality trait. Based on evidence from fMRI and electroencephalographical studies, we suggest that this association might arise from resting-state fluctuations constraining task-related neural responsiveness. Thereby, we outline a potential mechanism linking randomness of resting-state dynamics and personality",

    abstract = "Task-functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that early cortical recruitment exists in multiple sclerosis, which can partly explain the discrepancy between conventional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical disability. The study of the brain 'at rest' may provide additional information, because task-induced metabolic changes are relatively small compared to the energy use of the resting brain. We therefore questioned whether functional changes exist at rest in the early phase of multiple sclerosis, and addressed this question by a network analysis of no-task functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Fourteen patients with symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis (clinically isolated syndrome), 31 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and 41 healthy controls were included. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were brought to standard space using non-linear registration, and further analysed using multi-subject independent component analysis and individual time-course regression. Eight meaningful resting state networks were identified in our subjects and compared between the three groups with non-parametric permutation testing, using threshold-free cluster enhancement to correct for multiple comparisons. Additionally, quantitative measures of structural damage were obtained. Grey and white matter volumes, normalized for head size, were measured for each subject. White matter integrity was investigated with diffusion tensor measures that were compared between groups voxel-wise using tract-based spatial statistics. Patients with clinically isolated syndrome showed increased synchronization in six of the eight resting state networks, including the default mode network and sensorimotor network, compared to controls or relapsing remitting patients. No significant decreases were found in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. No significant resting state synchronization differences were found between relapsing remitting patients and controls. Normalized grey matter volume was decreased and white matter diffusivity measures were abnormal in relapsing remitting patients compared to controls, whereas no atrophy or diffusivity changes were found for the clinically isolated syndrome group. Thus, early synchronization changes are found in patients with clinically isolated syndrome that are suggestive of cortical reorganization of resting state networks. These changes are lost in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis with increasing brain damage, indicating that cortical reorganization of resting state networks is an early and finite phenomenon in multiple sclerosis.",

    abstract = "fMRI studies of brain activity at rest study slow (<0.1 Hz) intrinsic fluctuations in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal that are observed in a temporal scale of several minutes. The origin of these fluctuations is not clear but has previously been associated with slow changes in rhythmic neuronal activity resulting from changes in cortical excitability or neuronal synchronization. In this work, we show that individual spontaneous BOLD events occur during rest, in addition to slow fluctuations. Individual spontaneous BOLD events were identified by deconvolving the hemodynamic impulse response function for each time point in the fMRI time series, thus requiring no information on timing or a-priori spatial information of events. The patterns of activation detected were related to the motor, visual, default-mode, and dorsal attention networks. The correspondence between spontaneous events and slow fluctuations in these networks was assessed using a sliding window, seed-correlation analysis, where seed regions were selected based on the individual spontaneous event BOLD activity maps. We showed that the correlation varied considerably over time, peaking at the time of spontaneous events in these networks. By regressing spontaneous events out of the fMRI signal, we showed that both the correlation strength and the power in spectral frequencies <0.1 Hz decreased, indicating that spontaneous activation events contribute to low-frequency fluctuations observed in resting state networks with fMRI.

    abstract = "The study of the mechanism of acupuncture action was revolutionized by the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Over the past decade, our fMRI studies of healthy subjects have contributed substantially to elucidating the central effect of acupuncture on the human brain. These studies have shown that acupuncture stimulation, when associated with sensations comprising deqi, evokes deactivation of a limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network, which encompasses the limbic system, as well as activation of somatosensory brain regions. These networks closely match the default mode network and the anti-correlated task-positive network described in the literature. We have also shown that the effect of acupuncture on the brain is integrated at multiple levels, down to the brainstem and cerebellum. Our studies support the hypothesis that the effect of acupuncture on the brain goes beyond the effect of attention on the default mode network or the somatosensory stimulation of acupuncture needling. The amygdala and hypothalamus, in particular, show decreased activation during acupuncture stimulation that is not commonly associated with default mode network activity. At the same time, our research shows that acupuncture stimulation needs to be done carefully, limiting stimulation when the resulting sensations are very strong or when sharp pain is elicited. When acupuncture induced sharp pain, our studies show that the deactivation was attenuated or reversed in direction. Our results suggest that acupuncture mobilizes the functionally anti-correlated networks of the brain to mediate its actions, and that the effect is dependent on the psychophysical response. In this work we also discuss multiple avenues of future research, including the role of neurotransmitters, the effect of different acupuncture techniques, and the potential clinical application of our research findings to disease states including chronic pain, major depression, schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease",

    title = "{Resting-State Synchrony in Long-Term Abstinent Alcoholics.}",
    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol dependence is a disorder with an impulsive and compulsive "drive" toward alcohol consumption and an inability to inhibit alcohol consumption. Neuroimaging studies suggest that these behavioral components correspond to an increased involvement of regions that mediate appetitive drive and reduced involvement of regions that mediate executive control within top-down networks. Little is known, however, about whether these characteristics are present after long periods of abstinence. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected to examine resting-state synchrony (RSS) differences between 23 long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA; 8 women, age: M = 48.46, SD = 7.10), and 23 nonsubstance abusing controls (NSAC; 8 women, age: M = 47.99, SD = 6.70). Using seed-based measures, we examined RSS with the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). All participants were assessed with the intra/extradimensional set shift task outside of the scanner to explore the relationship between RSS and cognitive flexibility. RESULTS: Compared to NSAC, LTAA showed (i) decreased synchrony of limbic reward regions (e.g., caudate and thalamus) with both the anterior cingulate cortex seed and the NAcc seed and (ii) increased synchrony of executive control regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) with both the NAcc seed and the sgACC seed. RSS differences were significantly correlated with task performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with an interpretation of an ongoing compensatory mechanism in LTAA evident during rest, in which decision-making networks show reduced synchrony with appetitive drive regions and increased synchrony with inhibitory control regions. In addition, RSS differences were associated with cognitive flexibility. These resting-state findings indicate an adaptive mechanism present in long-term abstinence that may facilitate the behavioral control required to maintain abstinence},

The aim of this study was to compare the resting-state functional connectivity of the cerebellum in adults with major depression and healthy controls.METHODS: Twenty adults with major depression and 20 gender-, age-, and education-matched controls were investigated using seed-based resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: Compared with the controls, depressed patients showed significantly increased functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the temporal poles. However, significantly reduced cerebellar functional connectivity was observed in the patient group in relation to both the default-mode network, mainly including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and the executive control network, mainly including the superior frontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score was negatively correlated with the functional connectivity between the bilateral Lobule VIIb and the right superior frontal gyrus in depressed patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated increased cerebellar coupling with the temporal poles and reduced coupling with the regions in the default-mode and executive control networks in adults with major depression. These differences between patients and controls could be associated with the emotional disturbances and cognitive control function deficits that accompany major depression. Aberrant cerebellar connectivity during major depression may also imply a substantial role for the cerebellum in the pathophysiological models of depression",

The interactions among RSNs, being potentially dynamic and directional, may not be adequately captured by simple correlation or anticorrelation. In order to evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, we applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to the RSNs retrieved by independent component analysis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our analysis provided evidence for specific causal influences among the detected RSNs: default-mode, dorsal attention, core, central-executive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. In particular, we identified that self-referential and default-mode networks (DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the human brain functional architecture. Specifically, the former RSN exerted the strongest causal influence over the other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of self-referential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive processing. In quite contrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affected by the other RSNs, which may underlie an integration of information from primary function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies. Overall, our results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied information for a deeper understanding of the brain network dynamics.",

    abstract = {Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) provides a parsimonious model for stationary increments of a self-similar process parameterised by the Hurst exponent, H, and variance, sigma2. Fractional Gaussian noise with H < 0.5 demonstrates negatively autocorrelated or antipersistent behaviour; fGn with H > 0.5 demonstrates 1/f, long memory or persistent behaviour; and the special case of fGn with H = 0.5 corresponds to classical Gaussian white noise. We comparatively evaluate four possible estimators of fGn parameters, one method implemented in the time domain and three in the wavelet domain. We show that a wavelet-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimator yields the most efficient estimates of H and sigma2 in simulated fGn with 0 < H < 1. Applying this estimator to fMRI data acquired in the "resting" state from healthy young and older volunteers, we show empirically that fGn provides an accommodating model for diverse species of fMRI noise, assuming adequate preprocessing to correct effects of head movement, and that voxels with H > 0.5 tend to be concentrated in cortex whereas voxels with H < 0.5 are more frequently located in ventricles and sulcal CSF. The wavelet-ML estimator can be generalised to estimate the parameter vector beta for general linear modelling (GLM) of a physiological response to experimental stimulation and we demonstrate nominal type I error control in multiple testing of beta, divided by its standard error, in simulated and biological data under the null hypothesis beta = 0. We illustrate these methods principally by showing that there are significant differences between patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched comparison subjects in the persistence of fGn in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, insula, dorsal cingulate/medial premotor cortex, and left pre- and postcentral gyrus: patients with AD had greater persistence of resting fMRI noise (larger H) in these regions. Comparable abnormalities in the AD patients were also identified by a permutation test of local differences in the first-order autoregression AR(1) coefficient, which was significantly more positive in patients. However, we found that the Hurst exponent provided a more sensitive metric than the AR(1) coefficient to detect these differences, perhaps because neurophysiological changes in early AD are naturally better described in terms of abnormal salience of long memory dynamics than a change in the strength of association between immediately consecutive time points. We conclude that parsimonious mapping of fMRI noise properties in terms of fGn parameters efficiently estimated in the wavelet domain is feasible and can enhance insight into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.},

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to determine the ability of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to lateralise/localise the epileptogenic zone in patients presenting with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) at the individual level. METHODS: Basal functional connectivity (BFC) was evaluated in each hemisphere of 22 MTLE patients. 200 volumes were acquired using a single-shot GE-EPI sequence during a resting period of 10 min at 1.5 T. The signal time-course was extracted from 10 regions of interest (ROIs), five ROIs in each hemisphere, usually involved in epileptogenic networks of MTLE. Normalised correlation coefficients between pairs of ROIs signal time-courses were computed to reflect BFC. Based on normative BFC values obtained from 36 controls, the number of BFC decreases and increases were determined in each hemisphere for each patient. RESULTS: BFC decreases were found bilaterally, although the number of decreased links was significantly higher in the epileptogenic side (p=0.025). Conversely, BFC increases were found almost exclusively in the contralateral lobe leading to a strong test effect for locating the non-epileptic lobe with a sensitivity of 64\% and a specificity of 91\% (p<0.001). The most frequently disconnected areas were the entorhinal cortex and the anterior hippocampus in the epileptic lobe, while contralateral BFC increases involved preferentially hippocampus and amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the presence of BFC increases in the non-epileptic side was paradoxically the most specific marker of epileptogenic zone localisation, and suggests that a single resting-state fcMRI could be useful in the presurgical assessment of MTLE at an individual level.",

This study, in patients with heterogeneous damage to these networks, demonstrates network independence through a double dissociation of lesion location on two different measures of network integrity: functional correlations among network nodes and within-node graph theory network properties. The degree of network damage correlates with a decrease in functional connectivity within that network while sparing the nonlesioned network. Graph theory properties of intact nodes within the damaged network show evidence of dysfunction compared with the undamaged network. The effect of anatomical damage thus extends beyond the lesioned area, but remains within the bounds of the existing network connections.

    abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is an increasingly popular technique for studying brain dysfunction in psychiatric patients, and is widely assumed to measure intrinsic properties of functional brain organization. Here, we review rs-fMRI studies of psychiatric populations and consider how recent evidence concerning the neuronal basis, behavioural relevance, and the stability of rs-fMRI measures can inform and constrain interpretation of findings obtained using case-control designs. RECENT FINDINGS: A range of rs-fMRI measures have been applied to different patient groups, although the findings have not always been consistent. The large-scale organization of rs-fMRI networks is robust and reproducible, and rs-fMRI measures show correlations with behavioural phenotypes relevant to psychiatry. However, evidence that such measures are also influenced by preceding psychological states and contexts, as well as individual variations in physiological arousal, may help to explain inconsistent findings in case-control comparisons. SUMMARY: rs-fMRI measures show both stable and dynamic properties, the nature of which are only beginning to be uncovered. As such, interpreting significant differences between patients and controls on rs-fMRI measures as evidence for alterations in intrinsic functional brain organization should be done cautiously. Better understanding of the relationship between stable and transient aspects of spontaneous brain dynamics will be necessary to constrain interpretation of case-control studies and inform pathophysiological models.",

The results are described in terms of resting-state networks (RSN) and their properties. More specifically, in this study we examine the effect of severe prematurity on the spatial location of the visual, temporal, motor, basal ganglia, and the default mode networks, the temporal response properties of each of these networks, and the functional connectivity between them. Our results suggest that the anatomical locations of the RSNs are well developed by 18 months of age and their spatial locations are not distinguishable between premature and term born infants at 18 months or at 36 months, with the exception of small spatial differences noted in the basal ganglia area and the visual cortex. The two major differences between term and pre-term children were present at 36 but not 18 months and include: (1) increased spectral energy in the low frequency range (0.01-0.06 Hz) for pre-term children in the basal ganglia component, and (2) stronger connectivity between RSNs in term children. We speculate that children born very prematurely are vulnerable to injury resulting in weaker connectivity between resting-state networks by 36 months of age. Further work is required to determine whether this could be a clinically useful tool to identify children at risk of developmental delay related to premature birth.",

A total of 26 RGD patients and 24 matched controls were recruited, and neuropsychological tests, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and ACE I/D genotype were examined for each subject. A 2×2 factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) model (presence/absence of depression and presence/absence of ACE-D) was used to detect the interaction effect. Subsequent analyses were restricted to the significant interaction regions. There were significant interactions between disease and genotype at two clusters: left superior temporal gyrus/middle temporal gyrus and left cerebellum. And the ACE I/D polymorphism has disease-specific effects on the left superior temporal gyrus/middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum crus I. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the functional connection of PCC-left cerebellum crus I and the CFT-delayed recall test scores (r=0.668, P=0.003) in RGD group ACE-D allele carriers. These results suggest that the ACE I/D polymorphism can modulate the pathology of RGD, and the status of geriatric depression and the ACE-D allele may synergistically induce altered resting state network activity, which could influence the cognitive function and increase the mortality risk for cognitive impairment",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Emerging neuroscientific and genetic findings emphasize the dimensional rather than the categorical aspects of psychiatric disorders. However, the integration of dimensional approaches within the current categorical diagnostic framework remains unclear. Here, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether dimensional measures of psychiatric symptomatology capture brain-behavior relationships unaccounted for by categorical diagnoses. Additionally, we examined whether dimensional brain-behavior relationships are modified by the presence of a categorically defined illness, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected from 37 typically developing children (aged 10.2 ± 2; 21 female subjects) and 37 children meeting DSM-IV Text Revision criteria for ADHD (9.7 ± 2; 11 female subjects). Parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist Externalizing and Internalizing scores served as dimensional measures in our analyses of default network (DN) resting state functional connectivity (RSFC).RESULTS: Regardless of diagnosis, we observed several significant relationships between DN RSFC and both internalizing and externalizing scores. Increased internalizing scores were associated with stronger positive intra-DN RSFC, while increased externalizing scores were associated with reduced negative RSFC between DN and task-positive regions such as dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Several of these brain-behavior relationships differed depending on the categorical presence of ADHD.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that while categorical diagnostic boundaries provide an inadequate basis for understanding the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, psychiatric illness cannot be viewed simply as an extreme of typical neural or behavioral function. Efforts to understand the neural underpinnings of psychiatric illness should incorporate both categorical and dimensional clinical assessments",

    abstract = "Most of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrated the correlations between spatially distinct brain areas from the perspective of functional connectivity or functional integration. The functional connectivity approaches do not directly provide information of the amplitude of brain activity of each brain region within a network. Alternatively, an index named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-state fMRI signal has been suggested to reflect the intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity. However, it has been indicated that the ALFF is also sensitive to the physiological noise. The current study proposed a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, i.e., the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) to that of the entire frequency range and this approach was tested in two groups of resting-state fMRI data. The results showed that the brain areas within the default mode network including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly higher fALFF than the other brain areas. This pattern was consistent with previous neuroimaging results. The non-specific signal components in the cistern areas in resting-state fMRI were significantly suppressed, indicating that the fALFF approach improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. Its mechanism and sensitivity to abnormal brain activity should be evaluated in the future studies",

Although it is increasingly acknowledged that central nervous system mechanisms contribute to pain amplification and chronicity in TMDs, further research is needed to unravel neural correlates that might abet the development of chronic pain.OBJECTIVE: The insular cortex (IC) and cingulate cortex (CC) are both critically involved in the experience of pain. The current study sought specifically to investigate IC-CC functional connectivity in TMD patients and healthy controls (HCs), both during resting state and during the application of a painful stimulus.METHODS: Eight patients with TMD, and 8 age- and sex-matched HCs were enrolled in the present study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data during resting state and during the performance of a pressure pain stimulus to the temple were acquired. Predefined seed regions were placed in the IC (anterior and posterior insular cortices) and the extracted signal was correlated with brain activity throughout the whole brain. Specifically, we were interested whether TMD patients and HCs would show differences in IC-CC connectivity, both during resting state and during the application of a painful stimulus to the face.RESULTS: As a main finding, functional connectivity analyses revealed an increased functional connectivity between the left anterior IC and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in TMD patients, during both resting state and applied pressure pain. Within the patient group, there was a negative correlation between the anterior IC-ACC connectivity and clinical pain intensity as measured by a visual analog scale.CONCLUSIONS: Since the pregenual region of the ACC is critically involved in antinociception, we hypothesize that an increase in anterior IC-ACC connectivity is indicative of an adaptation of the pain modulatory system early in the chronification process",

    abstract = {Brain networks appear to have few and well localized regions with high functional connectivity density (hubs) for fast integration of neural processing, and their dysfunction could contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases. However the variability in the distribution of these brain hubs is unknown due in part to the overwhelming computational demands associated to their localization. Recently we developed a fast algorithm to map the local functional connectivity density (lFCD). Here we extend our method to map the global density (gFDC) taking advantage of parallel computing. We mapped the gFCD in the brain of 1031 subjects from the 1000 Functional Connectomes project and show that the strongest hubs are located in regions of the default mode network (DMN) and in sensory cortices, whereas subcortical regions exhibited the weakest hubs. The strongest hubs were consistently located in ventral precuneus/cingulate gyrus (previously identified by other analytical methods including lFCD) and in primary visual cortex (BA 17/18), which highlights their centrality to resting connectivity networks. In contrast and after rescaling, hubs in prefrontal regions had lower gFCD than lFCD, which suggests that their local functional connectivity (as opposed to long-range connectivity) prevails in the resting state. The power scaling of the probability distribution of gFCD hubs (as for lFCD) was consistent across research centers further corroborating the "scale-free" topology of brain networks. Within and between-subject variability for gFCD were twice than that for lFCD (20\% vs. 12\% and 84\% vs. 34\%, respectively) suggesting that gFCD is more sensitive to individual differences in functional connectivity.},

The pathophysiological mechanisms of continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep and neuropsychological deficits associated with this condition are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the haemodynamic changes associated with epileptic activity using simultaneous acquisitions of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging in 12 children with symptomatic and cryptogenic continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep. We compared the results of magnetic resonance to electric source analysis carried out using a distributed linear inverse solution at two time points of the averaged epileptic spike. All patients demonstrated highly significant spike-related positive (activations) and negative (deactivations) blood oxygenation-level-dependent changes (P < 0.05, family-wise error corrected). The activations involved bilateral perisylvian region and cingulate gyrus in all cases, bilateral frontal cortex in five, bilateral parietal cortex in one and thalamus in five cases. Electrical source analysis demonstrated a similar involvement of the perisylvian brain regions in all patients, independent of the area of spike generation. The spike-related deactivations were found in structures of the default mode network (precuneus, parietal cortex and medial frontal cortex) in all patients and in caudate nucleus in four. Group analyses emphasized the described individual differences. Despite aetiological heterogeneity, patients with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep were characterized by activation of the similar neuronal network: perisylvian region, insula and cingulate gyrus. Comparison with the electrical source analysis results suggests that the activations correspond to both initiation and propagation pathways. The deactivations in structures of the default mode network are consistent with the concept of epileptiform activity impacting on normal brain function by inducing repetitive interruptions of neurophysiological function",

    abstract = "Human neuroimaging has revealed a specific network of brain regions-the default-mode network (DMN)-that reduces its activity during goal-directed behavior. So far, evidence for a similar network in monkeys is mainly indirect, since, except for one positron emission tomography study, it is all based on functional connectivity analysis rather than activity increases during passive task states. Here, we tested whether a consistent DMN exists in monkeys using its defining property. We performed a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in 10 awake monkeys to reveal areas in which activity consistently decreases when task demands shift from passive tasks to externally oriented processing. We observed task-related spatially specific deactivations across 15 experiments, implying in the monkey a functional equivalent of the human DMN. We revealed by resting-state connectivity that prefrontal and medial parietal regions, including areas 9/46d and 31, respectively, constitute the DMN core, being functionally connected to all other DMN areas. We also detected two distinct subsystems composed of DMN areas with stronger functional connections between each other. These clusters included areas 24/32, 8b, and TPOC and areas 23, v23, and PGm, respectively. Such a pattern of functional connectivity largely fits, but is not completely consistent with anatomical tract tracing data in monkeys. Also, analysis of afferent and efferent connections between DMN areas suggests a multisynaptic network structure. Like humans, monkeys increase activity during passive epochs in heteromodal and limbic association regions, suggesting that they also default to internal modes of processing when not actively interacting with the environment.",

Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease",

In addition, two recent longitudinal studies have shown that functional connectivity changes track AD progression. This earlier work suggests that resting-state fMRI may be a promising biomarker for AD. However, some key issues still need to be addressed before resting-state fMRI can be successfully applied clinically. In a previous issue of Alzheimer's Research \& Therapy, Vemuri and colleagues discuss the use of resting-state fMRI in the study of AD.

In this work, a new data-driven noise correction, termed "APPLECOR" (for Affine Parameterization of Physiological Large-scale Error Correction), is introduced. APPLECOR models spatially-common physiological noise as the linear combination of an additive term and a mean-dependent multiplicative term, and then estimates and removes these components. APPLECOR is shown to achieve greater consistency of the default mode network across time and across subjects than was achieved using global mean regression, respiratory volume and heart rate correction (RVHRCOR (Chang et al., 2009)), or no correction. Combining APPLECOR with RVHRCOR regressors attained greater consistency than either correction alone.

    abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Imaging genomics is an emerging field that is rapidly identifying genes that influence the brain, cognition, and risk for disease. Worldwide, thousands of individuals are being scanned with high-throughput genotyping (genome-wide scans), and new imaging techniques [high angular resolution diffusion imaging and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] that provide fine-grained measures of the brain's structural and functional connectivity. Along with clinical diagnosis and cognitive testing, brain imaging offers highly reproducible measures that can be subjected to genetic analysis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies of twin, pedigree, and population-based datasets have discovered several candidate genes that consistently show small to moderate effects on brain measures. Many studies measure single phenotypes from the images, such as hippocampal volume, but voxel-wise genomic methods can plot the profile of genetic association at each 3D point in the brain. This exploits the full arsenal of imaging statistics to discover and replicate gene effects. SUMMARY: Imaging genomics efforts worldwide are now working together to discover and replicate many promising leads. By studying brain phenotypes closer to causative gene action, larger gene effects are detectable with realistic sample sizes obtainable from meta-analysis of smaller studies. Imaging genomics has broad applications to dementia, mental illness, and public health.",

    abstract = "This study explored the somatotopy of the motor areas of the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere, in the human brain. In a sample of 16 healthy participants, we drew 9 regions of interest (ROI) over the primary motor area (M1), each corresponding to a well-known somatic representation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the resting state functional connectivity between each selected ROI and the motor areas of the medial wall. The main finding was the identification of a rostrocaudal gradient of connectivity in which the more we move from cranial to caudal body representation areas in M1, the more the corresponding connected area in the medial wall is shifted rostrocaudally, confirming the somatotopic schema found in the SMA. We also reanalyzed data obtained in a previous experiment, we performed using hand and foot motor tasks; the reanalysis consisted in traditional BOLD and functional connectivity analyses. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of 28 studies of hand and foot motor tasks, mapping their cerebral representations using the tools provided by the Brainmap database. All data converge in confirming a somatotopic representation of the medial wall motor areas, with hand representation placed more rostrally and ventrally than that of the foot.",

Recently, remarkable advances have been made in the application of neuroimaging techniques in investigations of AD and MCI. Among the various neuroimaging techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has many potential advantages, noninvasively detecting alterations in brain function that may be present very early in the course of AD and MCI. In this paper, we first review task-related and resting-state fMRI studies on AD and MCI. We then present our recent fMRI studies with additional event-related potential (ERP) experiments during a motion perception task in MCI. Our results indicate that fMRI, especially when combined with ERP recording, can be useful for detecting spatiotemporal functional changes in AD and MCI patients.",

Here, we examined the integrity of the DN in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis (FEP) compared with sex- and age-matched healthy controls. METHODS: We collected R-fMRI data from 19 FEP patients (mean age 24.9±4.8yrs, 14 males) and 19 healthy controls (26.1±4.8yrs, 14 males) at 3T. Following standard preprocessing, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) of two DN subsystems and the two DN hubs (P<0.0045, corrected). RESULTS: Patients with FEP exhibited abnormal FC that appeared largely restricted to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) DN subsystem. Relative to controls, FEP patients exhibited weaker positive FC between dMPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, extending laterally through the parietal lobe to the posterior angular gyrus. Patients with FEP exhibited weaker negative FC between the lateral temporal cortex and the intracalcarine cortex, bilaterally. The PCC and temporo-parietal junction also exhibited weaker negative FC with the right fusiform gyrus extending to the lingual gyrus and lateral occipital cortex, in FEP patients, compared to controls. By contrast, patients with FEP showed stronger negative FC between the temporal pole and medial motor cortex, anterior precuneus and posterior mid-cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the dMPFC DN subsystem in patients with a FEP suggest that FC patterns are altered even in the early stages of psychosis},

We examined the default mode network, a medial-wall based network characterized by high baseline activity that decreases during attention-demanding cognitive tasks. We found reduced network homogeneity within the default mode network in ADHD subjects compared to age-matched controls, particularly between the precuneus and other default mode network regions. This confirms previously published results using seed-based functional connectivity measures, and provides further evidence that altered precuneus connectivity is involved in the neuropathology of ADHD. Network homogeneity provides a potential alternative method for assessing functional connectivity of specific large-scale networks in clinical populations},

If maximal resection is desired without inducing postoperative neurological deficits, a detailed knowledge of the functional topography in and around the tumor is crucial. The aim of the present work is to evaluate the value of preoperative magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging of functional connectivity to predict the results of intraoperative electrical stimulation (IES) mapping, the clinical gold standard for neurosurgical localization of functional areas.METHODS: Resting-state whole-cortex MEG recordings were obtained from 57 consecutive subjects with focal brain tumors near or within motor, sensory, or language areas. Neural activity was estimated using adaptive spatial filtering algorithms, and the mean imaginary coherence between the rest of the brain and voxels in and around brain tumors were compared to the mean imaginary coherence between the rest of the brain and contralesional voxels as an index of functional connectivity. IES mapping was performed in all subjects. The cortical connectivity pattern near the tumor was compared to the IES results.RESULTS: Maps with decreased resting-state functional connectivity in the entire tumor area had a negative predictive value of 100\% for absence of eloquent cortex during IES. Maps showing increased resting-state functional connectivity within the tumor area had a positive predictive value of 64\% for finding language, motor, or sensory cortical sites during IES mapping.INTERPRETATION: Preoperative resting state MEG connectivity analysis is a useful noninvasive tool to evaluate the functionality of the tissue surrounding tumors within eloquent areas, and could potentially contribute to surgical planning and patient counseling.",

A broader body of research implicates subcortical structures, particularly the striatum, in the physiopathology of autism. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed detailed maps of striatal circuitry in healthy and psychiatric populations and vividly captured maturational changes in striatal circuitry during typical development.METHODS: Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined striatal functional connectivity (FC) in 20 children with ASD and 20 typically developing children between the ages of 7.6 and 13.5 years. Whole-brain voxelwise statistical maps quantified within-group striatal FC and between-group differences for three caudate and three putamen seeds for each hemisphere.RESULTS: Children with ASD mostly exhibited prominent patterns of ectopic striatal FC (i.e., functional connectivity present in ASD but not in typically developing children), with increased functional connectivity between nearly all striatal subregions and heteromodal associative and limbic cortex previously implicated in the physiopathology of ASD (e.g., insular and right superior temporal gyrus). Additionally, we found striatal functional hyperconnectivity with the pons, thus expanding the scope of functional alterations implicated in ASD. Secondary analyses revealed ASD-related hyperconnectivity between the pons and insula cortex.CONCLUSIONS: Examination of FC of striatal networks in children with ASD revealed abnormalities in circuits involving early developing areas, such as the brainstem and insula, with a pattern of increased FC in ectopic circuits that likely reflects developmental derangement rather than immaturity of functional circuits.",

    abstract = "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder. A leading hypothesis is that SZ is a brain dysconnection syndrome, involving abnormal interactions between widespread brain networks. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is a powerful tool to explore the dysconnectivity of brain networks in SZ and other disorders. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis, spatial independent component analysis (ICA), and graph theory-based analysis are popular methods to quantify brain network connectivity in R-fMRI data. Widespread network dysconnectivity in SZ has been observed using both seed-based analysis and ICA, although most seed-based studies report decreased connectivity while ICA studies report both increases and decreases. Importantly, most of the findings from both techniques are also associated with typical symptoms of the illness. Disrupted topological properties and altered modular community structure of brain system in SZ have been shown using graph theory-based analysis. Overall, the resting-state findings regarding brain networks deficits have advanced our understanding of the underlying pathology of SZ. In this article, we review aberrant brain connectivity networks in SZ measured in R-fMRI by the above approaches, and discuss future challenges",

    abstract = {Neuroimaging studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have previously demonstrated several regions of hypo- and hyper-activation during voluntary movement. How these patterns of amplitude changes at multiple discrete foci relate to changes within functional networks recruited by a given task is unclear. Changes in both amplitude and connectivity have both been individually shown within the striato-thalamo-cortical (STC) loop in PD, as well as other regions, most consistently in the cerebellum and primary motor cortex. We have previously shown overactivation of the cerebellum and motor cortex in PD subjects off medication during a visuo-motor tracking task performed at three frequencies. Here, we show that this change in activation amplitude is also accompanied by significant changes in functional connectivity between regions of interest (ROIs), with enhanced connectivity within the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop as well as increased inter-hemispheric communication between several basal ganglia structures. Although changes in activation amplitude were influenced by the frequency of movement performed in the tracking task, functional connectivity changes were robustly present across all three task frequencies performed, suggesting that functional connectivity analysis in PD may be a more sensitive means of detecting plastic changes which are relatively invariant to the particulars of the experimental task. Additionally, we demonstrate amplitude and connectivity changes in structures that are typically active during the resting state, or "default-mode," in PD. Unlike in STC/CTC loops, where the direction of change was the same for amplitude and connectivity, default-mode regions showed increased amplitude but decreased connectivity. Our results further support that the CTC is recruited in PD to compensate for dysfunctional basal ganglia circuits, and that this recruitment involves both amplitude and connectivity changes. The differing relationship between amplitude and connectivity changes within individual loops highlights the importance of jointly examining them in order to fully elucidate functional changes in Parkinson's disease.},

A variety of models are used in practice that range from conceptual models of functional anatomy to nonlinear mathematical models of hemodynamic responses (e.g. as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) and neuronal responses. In this review, we discuss the most important models used to analyse functional imaging data and demonstrate how they are interrelated. Initially, we briefly review the anatomical foundations of current theories of brain function on which all mathematical models rest. We then introduce some basic statistical models (e.g. the general linear model) used for making classical (i.e. frequentist) and Bayesian inferences about where neuronal responses are expressed. The more challenging question, how these responses are caused, is addressed by models that incorporate biophysical constraints (e.g. forward models from the neural to the hemodynamic level) and/or consider causal interactions between several regions, i.e. models of effective connectivity. Some of the most refined models to date are neuronal mass models of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses. These models enable mechanistic inferences about how evoked responses are caused, at the level of neuronal subpopulations and the coupling among them",

However, an emerging body of literature is extending these classification studies to the decoding of values of continuous variables (such as age, cognitive characteristics, or neuropsychological state) using high-dimensional regression methods. This review details the methods used in such analyses and describes recent results. We provide specific examples of studies which have used this approach to answer novel questions about age and cognitive and disease states.

Using resting functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), we found that, in autism, there was altered functional organization of the network involved in social and emotional processing, but no group difference in the functional organization of the network involved in sustained attention and goal-directed cognition. We suggest that these findings might serve to relate the seemingly disparate strengths and weaknesses of the autistic behavioral, perceptual, and cognitive phenotype into a tractable neurofunctional framework.

Compared with controls and aMCI, AD was associated with opposing connectivity effects in the DMN (decreased) and frontal networks (enhanced). The only RS abnormality found in aMCI patients compared with controls was a precuneus connectivity reduction in the DMN. RS fMRI group differences were only partly related to gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the mean executive network connectivity was positively associated with frontal-executive and language neuropsychological scores. These results suggest that AD is associated with an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks, which extends well beyond the DMN. In AD, the limited resources of the DMN may be paralleled, in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency, by an increased prefrontal connectivity. A medial parietal RS fMRI signal change seems to be present since the early phase of AD.",

Nine consistently found functionally linked resting-state networks were retrieved from the resting-state data.

    abstract = "A common polymorphism within the nitric oxide sythanse-1 (NOS1) gene (rs6490121), initially identified as risk variant for schizophrenia, has been associated with variation in working memory and IQ. Here we investigated how this variation might be mediated at the level of brain structure and function. In healthy individuals (N=157), voxel based morphometry was used to compare grey matter (GM) volume between homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the 'G' allele (i.e. the allele associated with impaired cognition and schizophrenia risk) and homozygous carriers of the non-risk 'A' allele. Functional brain imaging data were also acquired from 48 participants during performance of a spatial working memory (SWM) task, and analysed to determine any effect of NOS1 risk status. An a priori region-of-interest analysis identified a significant reduction in ventromedial prefrontal GM volume in 'G' allele carriers. Risk carriers also exhibited altered patterns of activation in the prefrontal cortex, caudate, and superior parietal lobe, which were characteristic of abnormal increases in activation in frontoparietal working memory networks and a failure to disengage regions of the default mode network. These functional changes suggest a NOS1-mediated processing inefficiency, which may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. While the mechanisms by which NOS1 may influence brain structure and/or function have not yet been well delineated, these data provide further evidence for a role of NOS1 in risk for schizophrenia via an impact upon cognitive function",

The neuronal mechanisms underlying RSNs remain poorly understood. Here, we describe magnetoencephalographic correspondents of two well-characterized RSNs: the dorsal attention and the default mode networks. Seed-based correlation mapping was performed using time-dependent MEG power reconstructed at each voxel within the brain. The topography of RSNs computed on the basis of extended (5 min) epochs was similar to that observed with fMRI but confined to the same hemisphere as the seed region. Analyses taking into account the nonstationarity of MEG activity showed transient formation of more complete RSNs, including nodes in the contralateral hemisphere. Spectral analysis indicated that RSNs manifest in MEG as synchronous modulation of band-limited power primarily within the theta, alpha, and beta bands-that is, in frequencies slower than those associated with the local electrophysiological correlates of event-related BOLD responses.",

METHOD: Participants underwent a 5.5 min resting functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Brain areas whose activity positively correlated with that of the posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC) were assessed. To assess the relationship between severity of PTSD symptoms and PCC connectivity, the contrast image representing areas positively correlated with the PCC was correlated with the subjects' Clinician Administered PTSD Scale scores. RESULTS: Results suggest that resting state connectivity of the PCC with the perigenual anterior cingulate and the right amygdala is associated with current PTSD symptoms and that correlation with the right amygdala predicts future PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSION: These results may contribute to the development of prognostic tools to distinguish between those who will and those who will not develop PTSD.",

Specifically, there exists a temporal window of audiovisual integration within which stimuli are highly likely to be perceived as part of the same environmental event. Several studies have described the temporal bounds of this window, but few have investigated its malleability. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that a perceptual training paradigm is capable of eliciting a 40\% narrowing in the width of this window that is stable for at least 1 week after cessation of training. In the current study, we sought to reveal the neural substrates of these changes. Eleven human subjects completed an audiovisual simultaneity judgment training paradigm, immediately before and after which they performed the same task during an event-related 3T fMRI session. The posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and areas of auditory and visual cortex exhibited robust BOLD decreases following training, and resting state and effective connectivity analyses revealed significant increases in coupling among these cortices after training. These results provide the first evidence of the neural correlates underlying changes in multisensory temporal binding likely representing the substrate for a multisensory temporal binding window",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is hypothesized to involve disordered connectivity between brain regions. Currently, there are no direct measures of brain connectivity; functional and structural connectivity used separately provide only limited insight. Simultaneous measure of anatomical and functional connectivity and its interactions allow for better understanding of schizophrenia-related alternations in brain connectivity. METHODS: Twenty-seven schizophrenia patients and 27 healthy control subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Separate functional and anatomical connectivity maps were calculated and combined for each subject. Global, regional, and voxel measures and K-means network analysis were employed to identify group differences and correlation with clinical symptoms. RESULTS: A global connectivity analysis indicated that patients had lower anatomical connectivity and lower coherence between the two imaging modalities. In schizophrenia these group differences correlated with clinical symptom severity. Although anatomical connectivity nearly uniformly decreased, functional connectivity in schizophrenia was lower for some connections (e.g., middle temporal gyrus) and higher for others (e.g., cingulate and thalamus). Within the default mode network (DMN) two separate subsystems can be identified. Schizophrenia patients showed decoupling between structural and functional connectivity that can be localized to networks originating in posterior cingulate cortex as well as in the task-positive network and one of the DMN components. CONCLUSIONS: Combining two measures of brain connectivity provides more comprehensive descriptions of altered brain connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Patients show deficits in white matter anatomy, but functional connectivity alterations are more complex. Fusion of both methods allows identification of subsystems showing both increased and decreased functional connectivity.",

In this study, we used the regional homogeneity method blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals to determine changes in brain activity in response to transcutaneous electrical stimulation on acupoints and non-acupoints in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. BOLD fMRI scanning of the brain was performed for 306 seconds before and 30 minutes after transcutaneous electrical stimulation on acupoints UB63 (Jinmen), LV3 (Tai chong), ST36 (Zusanli), and GB40 (Qiuxu). The procedure was repeated after one week with stimulation on non-acupoints (one was 9 above BL67, the second was 12 above BL67 (Kunlun), the third was 7 above KI3, and the fourth was 10 above KI3 (Taixi)).RESULTS: The regional homogeneity in the acupoint group was increased in the left thalamus, caudate, putamen, lentiform nucleus (BA19, 30, 39), postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus (BA3, 4, 30, 32), calcarine fissure, middle temporal gyrus (BA30), right superior temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus (BA38), cuneus, and precuneus (BA7, 19) when compared to the non-acupoint group. The regional homogeneity of the acupoint group was decreased in the left cerebellum posterior lobe, middle frontal gyrus (BA10), double-side precuneus (BA7), and the postcentral gyrus (BA40).CONCLUSIONS: The brain region activated following acupoint stimulation is the ipsilateral pain-related brain region, which may relate to the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on pain relief. Further acupoint stimulation causes different central nervous responses compared to non-acupoint stimulation",

Functional connectivity within this network is also altered during the resting state. In this study our aim was to assess functional connectivity throughout the whole brain of patients with CAE. METHODS: We studied a group of eleven patients with untreated CAE and eleven matched controls using resting-state fMRI. We measured functional connectivity between every pair of voxels and generated images of "whole-brain" functional connectivity by counting the number of functional connections of each voxel. KEY FINDINGS: There were marked differences between CAE patients and controls in whole brain functional connectivity. The patients had decreased connectivity in the thalamus and basal ganglia and increased connectivity in the medial occipital cortex. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest enduring changes in function of the thalamus and the cortex in CAE patients even when there is no GSW activity. These human functional connectivity data support the findings in animal models of involvement of cortex as well as thalamus in absence epilepsy},

The present study investigated brain function before and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and demonstrated the effect of treatment on cortical activation patterns. METHODS: Six ECT-naive patients with depression (mean ± SD age, 39.0 ± 5.4 years) were treated with ECT. Within 1 week before and 1 to 3 weeks after ECT, the patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging session with functional magnetic resonance image scanning during working memory and affective tasks and during rest. Changes in voxelwise statistical maps of brain response to each task in regions identified to be relevant from past studies of depression were compared with changes in depression severity as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Score. Changes in functional connectivity between brain regions were also compared with changes in depression severity. RESULTS: Activation during both tasks was generally found to be decreased after ECT. Remission of depression was significantly associated with reduced affective deactivation after ECT in the orbitofrontal cortex (P = 0.03). Whole-brain functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex showed a consistent increase in connectivity to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex after ECT. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that successful ECT for MDD is associated with decreased activation to cognitive and emotional tasks and an increase in resting connectivity",

We evaluate these measures via simulations with different patterns of functional connectivity and provide recommendations for their use.

Recent studies have identified wider functional modules compared to previously defined networks and reported a small-world architecture of brain activity in which central nodes balance the pressure to evolve segregated pathways with the integration of local systems. The accurate identification of such central nodes is crucial but might be challenging for several reasons, e.g. inter-subject variability and physiological/pathological network plasticity, and recent works reported partially inconsistent results concerning the properties of these cortical hubs. Here, we applied a whole-brain data-driven approach to extract cortical functional cores and examined their connectivity from a resting state fMRI experiment on healthy subjects. Two main statistically significant cores, centered on the Posterior Cingulate Cortex and the Supplementary Motor Area, were extracted and their functional connectivity maps, thresholded at three statistical levels, revealed the presence of two complex systems. One system is consistent with the Default Mode Network (DMN) and gradually connects to visual regions, the other centered on motor regions and gradually connects to more sensory-specific portions of cortex. These two large scale networks eventually converged to regions belonging to the medial aspect of the DMN, potentially allowing inter-network interactions",

    title = "{Investigating the electrophysiological basis of resting state networks using magnetoencephalography.}",
    abstract = "In recent years the study of resting state brain networks (RSNs) has become an important area of neuroimaging. The majority of studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure temporal correlation between blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from different brain areas. However, BOLD is an indirect measure related to hemodynamics, and the electrophysiological basis of connectivity between spatially separate network nodes cannot be comprehensively assessed using this technique. In this paper we describe a means to characterize resting state brain networks independently using magnetoencephalography (MEG), a neuroimaging modality that bypasses the hemodynamic response and measures the magnetic fields associated with electrophysiological brain activity. The MEG data are analyzed using a unique combination of beamformer spatial filtering and independent component analysis (ICA) and require no prior assumptions about the spatial locations or patterns of the networks. This method results in RSNs with significant similarity in their spatial structure compared with RSNs derived independently using fMRI. This outcome confirms the neural basis of hemodynamic networks and demonstrates the potential of MEG as a tool for understanding the mechanisms that underlie RSNs and the nature of connectivity that binds network nodes.",

Despite the well-established, albeit incomplete, clinical efficacies of D(2) antagonists, no studies have examined their effects on functional interaction between brain regions. We hypothesized that haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic and D(2) antagonist, would modulate functional connectivity in dopaminergic circuits. Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats received either haloperidol (1mg/kg, s.c.) or the same volume of saline a week apart. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired 20min after injection. Connectivity analyses were performed using two complementary approaches: correlation analysis between 44 atlas-derived regions of interest, and seed-based connectivity mapping. In the presence of haloperidol, reduced correlation was observed between the substantia nigra and several brain regions, notably the cingulate and prefrontal cortices, posterodorsal hippocampus, ventral pallidum, and motor cortex. Haloperidol induced focal changes in functional connectivity were found to be the most strongly associated with ascending dopamine projections. These included reduced connectivity between the midbrain and the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, possibly relating to its therapeutic action, and decreased coupling between substantia nigra and motor areas, which may reflect dyskinetic effects. These data may help in further characterizing the functional circuits modulated by antipsychotics that could be targeted by innovative drug treatments",

    abstract = {Human and nonhuman primates exhibit flexible behavior. Functional, anatomical, and lesion studies indicate that the lateral frontal cortex (LFC) plays a pivotal role in such behavior. LFC consists of distinct subregions exhibiting distinct connectivity patterns that possibly relate to functional specializations. Inference about the border of each subregion in the human brain is performed with the aid of macroscopic landmarks and/or cytoarchitectonic parcellations extrapolated in a stereotaxic system. However, the high interindividual variability, the limited availability of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps, and the absence of robust functional localizers render the in vivo delineation and examination of the LFC subregions challenging. In this study, we use resting state fMRI for the in vivo parcellation of the human LFC on a subjectwise and data-driven manner. This approach succeeds in uncovering neuroanatomically realistic subregions, with potential anatomical substrates including BA 46, 44, 45, 9 and related (sub)divisions. Ventral LFC subregions exhibit different functional connectivity (FC), which can account for different contributions in the language domain, while more dorsal adjacent subregions mark a transition to visuospatial/sensorimotor networks. Dorsal LFC subregions participate in known large-scale networks obeying an external/internal information processing dichotomy. Furthermore, we traced "families" of LFC subregions organized along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axis with distinct functional networks also encompassing specialized cingulate divisions. Similarities with the connectivity of macaque candidate homologs were observed, such as the premotor affiliation of presumed BA 46. The current findings partially support dominant LFC models},

This EEG power attenuation parallels reductions of structural and metabolic markers of neuronal maturation (i.e., gray matter loss and decrease of absolute cerebral glucose utilization). However, it is largely unknown what causes these electrophysiological changes, and how this functional reorganization relates to other functional measures such as the fMRI BOLD signal. In this study, we used simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI to localize hemodynamic correlates of fluctuating EEG oscillations and to study the development of this EEG-BOLD coupling. Furthermore, the maturational EEG power attenuation was directly compared to BOLD signal power maturation. Both analyses were novel in their developmental perspective and aimed at providing a functional lead to EEG maturation. Data from 19 children, 18 adolescents and 18 young adults were acquired in 10min eyes-open/eyes-closed resting states. Our results revealed that both EEG and BOLD amplitudes strongly decrease between childhood and adulthood, but their functional coupling remains largely unchanged. The global reduction of absolute amplitude of spontaneous slow BOLD signal fluctuation is a novel marker for brain maturation, and parallels the globally decreasing trajectories of EEG amplitudes, gray matter and glucose metabolism during adolescence. Further, the absence of thalamocortical EEG-BOLD coupling in children together with age-related normalized thalamic BOLD power increase indicated maturational changes in brain state regulation",

    abstract = {There has been a growing interest in the neuroimaging community regarding resting state data (i.e., passive mental activity) and the subsequent activation of the so-called default mode network (DMN). Although this network was originally characterized by a pattern of deactivation during active cognitive states, more recent applications of data-driven techniques such as independent component analysis (ICA) have permitted the analysis of brain activation during extended periods of truly passive mental activity. However, ICA requires the resultant components to be evaluated for "goodness of fit" via either human raters or more automated techniques. To our knowledge, an investigation on the reliability of either technique in determining the component that best corresponds to default-mode activity has not been performed. Moreover, it is not clear how automated techniques, which are necessarily dependent upon a template mask, are affected by the structures used to compose the mask. The current study investigated both interrater (human-human) reliability and intermethod (human-machine) reliability for determining DMN activation in 42 healthy controls. Results indicated that near perfect interrater reliability was achieved, whereas intermethod reliability was only within the moderate range. The latter was significantly improved via a weighted combination of the anterior and posterior cingulate nodes of the DMN. Implications for fully automating the component selection process are discussed},

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Live failure can cause brain edema and aberrant brain function in cirrhotic patients. In particular, decreased functional connectivity within the brain default-mode network (DMN) has been recently reported in overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients. However, so far, little is known about the connectivity among the DMN in the minimal HE (MHE), the mildest form of HE. Here, we combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to test our hypothesis that both structural and functional connectivity within the DMN were disturbed in MHE.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty MHE patients and 20 healthy controls participated in the study. We explored the changes of structural (path length, tracts count, fractional anisotropy [FA] and mean diffusivity [MD] derived from DTI tractography) and functional (temporal correlation coefficient derived from rs-fMRI) connectivity of the DMN in MHE patients. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the structural/functional indices and venous blood ammonia levels/neuropsychological tests scores of patients. All thresholds were set at P<0.05, Bonferroni corrected.RESULTS: Compared to the healthy controls, MHE patients showed both decreased FA and increased MD in the tract connecting the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCUN) to left parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), and decreased functional connectivity between the PCC/PCUN and left PHG, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). MD values of the tract connecting PCC/PCUN to the left PHG positively correlated to the ammonia levels, the temporal correlation coefficients between the PCC/PCUN and the MPFC showed positive correlation to the digital symbol tests scores of patients.CONCLUSION: MHE patients have both disturbed structural and functional connectivity within the DMN. The decreased functional connectivity was also detected between some regions without abnormal structural connectivity, suggesting that the former may be more sensitive in detecting the early abnormalities of MHE. This study extends our understanding of the pathophysiology of MHE",

We summarize emerging elements likely to gain more widespread use in the coming years, owing to 1) their utility in diagnosis, prognosis, understanding the natural course of degeneration or recovery following TBI, and potential for evaluating treatment strategies, 2) the ability of many centers to acquire these data with scanners and equipment that are readily available in existing clinical and research settings, and 3) advances in software that provide more automated, readily available, and cost-effective analysis methods for large scale data image analysis. These include multi-slice computed tomography (CT), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), arterial spin tag labeling (ASL), functional MRI (fMRI), including resting state and connectivity MRI, MR spectroscopy (MRS) and hyperpolarization scanning. However, we also include brief introductions to other specialized forms of advanced imaging that currently do require specialized equipment (e.g., single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), encephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG)/magnetic source imaging (MSI).

The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections of M1 exhibit short-term and long-term plasticity, which is a strong substrate for learning-related map reorganization. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for few minutes over M1 has been shown to induce relatively long-lasting plastic alterations and to modulate motor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that the relatively long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1 results in the alteration of associations among populations of M1 neurons which may be reflected in changes of its functional architecture. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10 minutes of tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left M1. For each functional dataset, grey-matter voxels belonging to Brodmann area 4 (BA4) were labelled and afterwards BA4 voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal network parameters which characterize the architecture of functional networks (connectivity degree, clustering coefficient and characteristic path-length) were computed, transformed to volume maps and compared before and after stimulation. At the dorsolateral-BA4 region cathodal tDCS boosted local connectedness, while anodal-tDCS enhanced long distance functional communication within M1. Additionally, the more efficient the functional architecture of M1 was at baseline, the more efficient the tDCS-induced functional modulations were. In summary, we show here that it is possible to non-invasively reorganize the intrinsic functional architecture of M1, and to image such alterations",

Connectivity was investigated in 47 subjects aged 60 years and over: 15 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies, 16 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 16 control subjects. Subjects were scanned using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. The mean blood oxygenation level-dependent signal time series was extracted from seed regions in the hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and primary visual cortex and correlated with all other brain voxels to determine functional connectivity. Both subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease showed greater connectivity than control subjects. Compared with controls, the dementia with Lewy bodies group had greater connectivity between the right posterior cingulate cortex and other brain areas. In dementia with Lewy bodies, there were no significant differences in hippocampal connectivity compared with controls, but in Alzheimer's disease left hippocampal connectivity was greater compared with controls. There were no significant differences between groups for precuneus or primary visual cortex connectivity. No seed regions showed significantly less connectivity in subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. We found greater connectivity with the posterior cingulate in dementia with Lewy bodies and with the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease. Consistent with the known relative preservation of memory in dementia with Lewy bodies compared with Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal connectivity was not found to be greater in dementia with Lewy bodies. Importantly, while metabolic imaging shows functional change in primary visual cortex in dementia with Lewy bodies, which is hypothesized to account for visual hallucinations, we found connectivity with this region to be unaffected.

    abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Adult major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with reduced cortico-limbic functional connectivity thought to indicate decreased top-down control of emotion. However, it is unclear whether such connectivity alterations are also present in early-childhood-onset MDD.METHOD: A total of 51 children 7 through 11 years of age who had been prospectively studied since preschool age, completed resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and were assigned to one of four groups: 1) C-MDD (N = 13), those children with a personal history of early-childhood-onset MDD; 2) M-MDD (N = 11), those with a maternal history of affective disorders; 3) CM-MDD (N = 13), those with both maternal and early-childhood-onset MDD; or 4) CON (N = 14), those without either a personal or maternal history of MDD. We used seed-based resting state functional connectivity (rsfcMRI) analysis in an independent sample of adults to identify networks showing both positive (e.g., limbic regions) and negative (e.g., dorsal frontal/parietal regions) connectivity with the amygdala. These regions were then used in region-of-interest-based analyses of our child sample.RESULTS: We found a significant interaction between maternal affective disorder history and the child's MDD history for both positive and negative rsfcMRI networks. Specifically, when compared with CON, we found reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the "negative network" in children with C-MDD, M-MDD, and CM-MDD. Children with either C-MDD or a maternal history of MDD (but not CM-MDD) displayed reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the "positive network."CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an attenuated relationship between the amygdala, a region affected in MDD and involved in emotion processing, and cognitive control regions is consistent with a hypothesis of altered regulation of emotional processing in C-MDD, suggesting developmental continuity of this alteration into early childhood},

    abstract = "The functional architecture of the human brain has been extensively described in terms of complex networks characterized by efficient small-world features. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found altered small-world topological properties of brain functional networks in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) during the resting state. However, little is known about the small-world properties of brain networks in the context of a task. In this study, we investigated the topological properties of human brain functional networks derived from fMRI during an auditory oddball (AOD) task. Data were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 20 SZ; A left and a right task-related network which consisted of the top activated voxels in temporal lobe of each hemisphere were analyzed separately. All voxels were detected by group independent component analysis. Connectivity of the left and right task-related networks were estimated by partial correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. The small-worldness values were decreased in both hemispheres in SZ. In addition, SZ showed longer shortest path length and lower global efficiency only in the left task-related networks. These results suggested small-world attributes are altered during the AOD task-related networks in SZ which provided further evidences for brain dysfunction of connectivity in SZ.",

    abstract = "This study evaluated a calibration technique for scaling the fMRI-BOLD response during a simple motor task. A novel scaling parameter, resting state physiological fluctuation amplitude (RSFA), was tested using previously established scaling factors such as breath hold or 5\% CO(2). RSFA was hypothesized to contain vascular reactivity information present in the resting state fMRI signal. Subjects were scanned under various stimulus conditions: (a) rest while breathing room air, (b) bilateral fingertapping, (c) breath holding and (d) moderate hypercapnia (breathing 5\% CO(2)+air). In all subjects who breathed 5\% CO(2), RSFA correlated highly with the BOLD response amplitude during 5\% CO(2) inhalation. Also, RSFA correlated highly with the amplitude of the BOLD response elicited by breath hold. RSFA was therefore used as a hemodynamic scaling factor to calibrate both the amplitude and spatial extent of the fMRI-BOLD response during the motor task (fingertapping). Results revealed that amplitude scaling using RSFA was similar to that using breath hold or 5\% CO(2), where the spatial extent of activation diminished by 20-37\% over all subjects. Spatial extent of activation changed significantly after scaling and only 30-40\% of the activated area overlapped with the unscaled activation. RSFA-scaled task-induced fMRI-BOLD response in both amplitude and spatial extent was comparable to that obtained using breath hold or 5\% CO(2). We conclude that RSFA may be used to hemodynamically scale the fMRI-BOLD response and does not require the use of a hypercapnic challenge (which may not be purely non-neural), which can be difficult to implement in special populations.",

    abstract = "Studies have suggested that the default mode network is active during mind wandering, which is often experienced intermittently during sustained attention tasks. Conversely, an anticorrelated task-positive network is thought to subserve various forms of attentional processing. Understanding how these two systems work together is central for understanding many forms of optimal and sub-optimal task performance. Here we present a basic model of naturalistic cognitive fluctuations between mind wandering and attentional states derived from the practice of focused attention meditation. This model proposes four intervals in a cognitive cycle: mind wandering, awareness of mind wandering, shifting of attention, and sustained attention. People who train in this style of meditation cultivate their abilities to monitor cognitive processes related to attention and distraction, making them well suited to report on these mental events. Fourteen meditation practitioners performed breath-focused meditation while undergoing fMRI scanning. When participants realized their mind had wandered, they pressed a button and returned their focus to the breath. The four intervals above were then constructed around these button presses. We hypothesized that periods of mind wandering would be associated with default mode activity, whereas cognitive processes engaged during awareness of mind wandering, shifting of attention and sustained attention would engage attentional subnetworks. Analyses revealed activity in brain regions associated with the default mode during mind wandering, and in salience network regions during awareness of mind wandering. Elements of the executive network were active during shifting and sustained attention. Furthermore, activations during these cognitive phases were modulated by lifetime meditation experience. These findings support and extend theories about cognitive correlates of distributed brain networks",

    abstract = "Tasks that demand externalized attention reliably suppress default network activity while activating the dorsal attention network. These networks have an intrinsic competitive relationship; activation of one suppresses activity of the other. Consequently, many assume that default network activity is suppressed during goal-directed cognition. We challenge this assumption in an fMRI study of planning. Recent studies link default network activity with internally focused cognition, such as imagining personal future events, suggesting a role in autobiographical planning. However, it is unclear how goal-directed cognition with an internal focus is mediated by these opposing networks. A third anatomically interposed 'frontoparietal control network' might mediate planning across domains, flexibly coupling with either the default or dorsal attention network in support of internally versus externally focused goal-directed cognition, respectively. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing brain activity during autobiographical versus visuospatial planning. Autobiographical planning engaged the default network, whereas visuospatial planning engaged the dorsal attention network, consistent with the anti-correlated domains of internalized and externalized cognition. Critically, both planning tasks engaged the frontoparietal control network. Task-related activation of these three networks was anatomically consistent with independently defined resting-state functional connectivity MRI maps. Task-related functional connectivity analyses demonstrate that the default network can be involved in goal-directed cognition when its activity is coupled with the frontoparietal control network. Additionally, the frontoparietal control network may flexibly couple with the default and dorsal attention networks according to task domain, serving as a cortical mediator linking the two networks in support of goal-directed cognitive processes.",

The regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to assess the strength of local connectivity. The associations between ReHo and full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores were studied in a voxel-wise manner using partial correlation analysis controlling for age and sex. We found that the FSIQ scores were positively correlated with the ReHo values of the bilateral inferior parietal lobules, middle frontal, parahippocampal and inferior temporal gyri, the right thalamus, superior frontal and fusiform gyri, and the left superior parietal lobule. The main findings are consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) of intelligence, supporting the view that general intelligence involves multiple brain regions throughout the brain.",

The aim of the paper was to explore whether and how diabetic neuropathic pain (NP) affects attentional networks. METHODS: The authors sought to achieve this by investigating resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in diabetic NP patients and comparing it with that of matched healthy controls. RESULTS: NP patients showed a widespread reduction in connectivity in both the dorsal and ventral attentional networks, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), typically implicated in salience processing. The authors also found a generalised reduction in the length of functional connections in the NP group: in all the examined networks, the Euclidean distance between connected voxels was significantly shorter in patients than in controls. CONCLUSION: In diabetic NP, a parieto-fronto-cingulate network controlling attention to external stimuli is impaired. In line with previous studies, chronic pain can disrupt the synchrony of a common pool of brain areas, involved in self-monitoring, pain processing and salience detection.",

Bipolar Disord 2012: 14: 411-431. © 2012 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons A/S. Objective: Although bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) have a number of clinical features and certain susceptibility genes in common, they are considered separate disorders, and it is unclear which aspects of pathophysiology are specific to each condition. Here, we examine the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature to determine the evidence for diagnosis-specific patterns of brain activation in the two patient groups. Method: A systematic search was performed to identify fMRI studies directly comparing BD and SCZ to examine evidence for diagnosis-specific activation patterns. Studies were categorized into (i) those investigating emotion, reward, or memory, (ii) those describing executive function or language tasks, and (iii) those looking at the resting state or default mode networks. Studies reporting estimates of sensitivity and specificity of classification are also summarized, followed by studies reporting associations with symptom severity measures. Results: In total, 21 studies were identified including patients (n = 729) and healthy subjects (n = 465). Relative over-activation in the medial temporal lobe and associated structures was found in BD versus SCZ in tasks involving emotion or memory. Evidence of differences between the disorders in prefrontal regions was less consistent. Accuracy values for assignment of diagnosis were generally lower in BD than in SCZ. Few studies reported significant symptom associations; however, these generally implicated limbic regions in association with manic symptoms. Conclusions: Although there are a limited number of studies and a cautious approach is warranted, activation differences were found in the medial temporal lobe and associated limbic regions, suggesting the presence of differences in the neurobiological substrates of SCZ and BD. Future studies examining symptom dimensions, risk-associated genes, and the effects of medication will aid clarification of the mechanisms behind these differences",

    abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of acupuncture have demonstrated extensive signal attenuations in the core regions of a "default mode" network as well as signal potentiations in the regions of a "central-executive" network. We proposed that this acupuncture-related dichotomy may represent the anticorrelation in these intrinsic brain networks showing spontaneous fluctuations during rest. According to a plentiful clinical report, acupuncture can provide pain relief beyond the time it is being administrated; therefore, imaging its sustained effect (rather than acute effect) on the brain networks may further help elucidate the mechanisms by which acupuncture achieves its therapeutic effects. As an interface, the anterior insula (AI) has recently been shown to be a network hub, which initiates dynamic switching between these intrinsic networks. Here, we attempt to explore how acupuncture can modulate spontaneous coherences of these resting networks anchored by the AI. Using a spontaneous activity detection approach, we identified an AI-related dichotomy showing spontaneous activations in the CEN along with wide spontaneous deactivations located exclusively in the DMN. Following verum acupuncture, but not sham control, there was a prominently enhanced dichotomy in the CEN and DMN networks. More importantly, a long-lasting effect of acupuncture could further modulate intrinsic coherences of the wide interoceptive-autonomic areas, including the paralimbic regions and brainstem nuclei. These findings suggested that acupuncture may not only enhance the dichotomy of the anticorrelated resting networks, but also modulate a larger spatio-temporal extent of spontaneous activities in the salient interoceptive-autonomic network, contributing to potential actions in the endogenous pain-modulation circuits and homeostatic control mechanisms},

We compared T2DM patients (n = 10, age = 56 ± 2.2 years, fasting plasma glucose [FPG] = 8.4 ± 1.3 mmol/L, HbA(1c) = 7.5 ± 0.54\%) with nondiabetic age-matched control subjects (n = 11, age = 54 ± 1.8 years, FPG = 4.8 ± 0.2 mmol/L) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate functional connectivity strength among DMN regions. We also evaluated hippocampal volume, cognition, and insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Control subjects showed stronger correlations versus T2DM patients in the DMN between the seed (posterior cingulate) and bilateral middle temporal gyrus ($\beta$ = 0.67 vs. 0.43), the right inferior and left medial frontal gyri ($\beta$ = 0.75 vs. 0.54), and the left thalamus ($\beta$ = 0.59 vs. 0.37), respectively, with no group differences in cognition or hippocampal size. In T2DM patients, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus. T2DM patients showed reduced functional connectivity in the DMN compared with control subjects, which was associated with insulin resistance in selected brain regions, but there were no group effects of brain structure or cognition",

    abstract = "Early visual deprivation can lead to changes in the brain, which may be explained by either of two hypotheses. The general loss hypothesis has been proposed to explain maladjustments, while the compensatory plasticity hypothesis may explain a superior ability in the use of the remaining senses. Most previous task-based functional MRI (fMRI) studies have supported the compensatory plasticity hypothesis, but it has been difficult to provide evidence to support the general loss hypothesis, since the blind cannot execute visual tasks. The study of resting state fMRI data may provide an opportunity to simultaneously detect the two aspects of changes in the blind. In this study, using a whole brain perspective, we investigated the decreased and increased functional connectivities in the early blind using resting state fMRI data. The altered functional connectivities were identified by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair of brain regions of 16 early blind subjects (9 males; age range: 15.6-29.3 years, mean age: 22.1 years) with the corresponding coefficients of gender- and age-matched sighted volunteers. Compared with the sighted subjects, the blind demonstrated the decreased functional connectivities within the occipital visual cortices as well as between the occipital visual cortices and the parietal somatosensory, frontal motor and temporal multisensory cortices. Such differences may support the general loss hypothesis. However, we also found that the introduction of Braille earlier in life and for longer daily practice times produced stronger functional connectivities between these brain areas. These findings may support the compensatory plasticity hypothesis. Additionally, we found several increased functional connectivities between the occipital cortices and frontal language cortices in those with early onset of blindness, which indicate the predominance of compensatory plasticity. Our findings indicate that changes in the functional connectivities in the resting state may be an integrated reflection of general loss and compensatory plasticity when a single sensory modality is deprived.",

The neuronal basis of connectivity as assessed by resting-state fMRI still needs to be fully clarified, considering that these signals are an indirect measure of neuronal activity, reflecting slow local variations in de-oxyhaemoglobin concentration. Here, we combined fMRI with multifocal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a technique that allows the investigation of the causal neurophysiological interactions occurring in specific cortico-cortical connections. We investigated whether the physiological properties of parieto-frontal circuits mapped with short-latency multifocal TMS at rest may have some relationship with the resting-state fMRI measures of specific resting-state functional networks (RSNs). Results showed that the activity of fast cortico-cortical physiological interactions occurring in the millisecond range correlated selectively with the coupling of fMRI slow oscillations within the same cortical areas that form part of the dorsal attention network, i.e., the attention system believed to be involved in reorientation of attention. We conclude that resting-state fMRI ongoing slow fluctuations likely reflect the interaction of underlying physiological cortico-cortical connections",

Here we investigated how emotionally positive and negative information differentially influenced subsequent brain activity at rest. We acquired fMRI data in 15 participants during rest periods following fearful, joyful, and neutral movies. Several brain regions were more active during resting than during movie-watching, including posterior/anterior cingulate cortices (PCC, ACC), bilateral insula and inferior parietal lobules (IPL). Functional connectivity at different frequency bands was also assessed using a wavelet correlation approach and small-world network analysis. Resting activity in ACC and insula as well as their coupling were strongly enhanced by preceding emotions, while coupling between ventral-medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala was selectively reduced. These effects were more pronounced after fearful than joyful movies for higher frequency bands. Moreover, the initial suppression of resting activity in ACC and insula after emotional stimuli was followed by a gradual restoration over time. Emotions did not affect IPL average activity but increased its connectivity with other regions. These findings reveal specific neural circuits recruited during the recovery from emotional arousal and highlight the complex functional dynamics of default mode networks in emotionally salient contexts.",

The current study is a randomized, cross-sectional resting-state fMRI study where we gave a single dose of commonly prescribed amounts of either benzodiazepine (oxazepam), L-dopa or placebo to 81 healthy subjects. We hypothesized that connectivity in resting-state networks would be altered, and that the strength of connectivity in areas rich in target receptors would be particularly affected. Additionally, based on known anxiolytic mechanisms of benzodiazepines, we predicted modulated amygdala connectivity. To test this, we performed seed region based correlational analysis using seven seeds placed in well characterized resting-state networks, in regions with above average densities of GABA-A- or dopamine receptors and in amygdala. To alleviate the anatomical bias introduced by the a priori selected seed regions, we also carried out whole brain exploratory analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF). Oxazepam increased functional connectivity between midline regions of the default mode network and prefrontal, parietal and cerebellar areas, but decreased connectivity between e.g. amygdala and temporal cortex. L-dopa mainly decreased connectivity between the amygdala and bilateral inferior frontal gyri and between midline regions of the default mode network (DMN). The fALFF analysis revealed that L-dopa decreased low-frequency fluctuations in cerebellum. We conclude that the overall effects of single administrations of oxazepam and L-dopa on resting-state connectivity were small both in strength and in spatial extent, and were on par with placebo effects as revealed by comparing the two placebo groups",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 69 short-term abstinent alcoholics. Participants performed the affective go/no-go task outside of the scanner. At 6-month follow-up, participants were grouped as abstainers (N = 40; age: M = 46.70, standard deviation [SD] = 6.83) and relapsers (N = 29; age: M = 46.91, SD = 7.25). We examined baseline resting-state synchrony (RSS) using seed-based measures. Compared with abstainers, relapsers showed significantly decreased RSS within both the reward and executive control networks as well as within the visual network (P < 0.05). Lower RSS in relapsers could predict relapse (P < 0.05) and was significantly correlated with poor inhibitory control of emotional-laden stimuli (P < 0.017) and with alcohol use (P < 0.05). Results suggest that lower RSS during short-term abstinence may predict subsequent relapse. The association of lower RSS with poorer inhibitory control suggests that low RSS may constitute a faulty foundation for future responses to external cues, which can be manifested as the inability to inhibit behavior",

T fMRI, however, has been mostly limited to partial brain coverage with previous whole-brain applications sacrificing either the spatial or temporal resolution.Here we present whole-brain high-resolution (1, 1.5 and 2. mm isotropic voxels) resting state fMRI at 7. T, obtained with parallel imaging technology, without sacrificing temporal resolution or brain coverage, over what is typically achieved at 3. T with several fold larger voxel volumes.Using Independent Component Analysis we demonstrate that high resolution images acquired at 7. T retain enough sensitivity for the reliable extraction of typical resting state brain networks and illustrate the added value of obtaining both single subject and group maps, using cortex based alignment, of the default-mode network (DMN) with high native resolution. By comparing results between multiple resolutions we show that smaller voxels volumes (1 and 1.5. mm isotropic) data result in reduced partial volume effects, permitting separations of detailed spatial features within the DMN patterns as well as a better function to anatomy correspondence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

In this report, by a newly developed approach taking into account n-to-1 connectivity using 1-to-1 connectivity measures instead of conventional pairwise connectivity, we show the existence of a large organized functional connectivity network related to motor function in the resting brain with fMRI. More importantly, we found that such a network can be modulated from a conscious resting state to planning, initiation, coordination, guidance, and termination of voluntary movement state, exhibited by significant changes of functional connectivity of some brain regions in different brain activity.

    abstract = "Cognitive aging is accompanied by a range of structural and functional differences in the brain, even in the absence of neurodegenerative disease. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported increased bilateral activation during task performance in elderly participants compared to their younger counterparts, particularly in frontal regions. Alterations have also been observed in the functional architecture of the resting brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in the organization of the networks of the brain. However, previous studies have largely focused on the default mode network, and little is known about the effects of age on other resting state-networks (RSNs). The aim of the present study was to investigate age-differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI data obtained during rest from 238 healthy participants aged 21-80years. Using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual-regression, the results revealed age-related increases in RSFC across a range of RSNs, including task-positive networks in frontal and parietal regions. In contrast, age-related reductions in the default mode network and occipital visual networks were observed. Furthermore, whereas the effects of age on the various RSNs were found independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume, sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and widespread effects of estimated subject motion on the RSFC across RSNs. The results provide support for the notion of network-specific effects in aging, manifested as increased tonic activation of task-positive networks, supporting higher-order cognitive functions and cognitive control, along with reduced task-negative default mode network and sensory visual networks during rest. The present results also corroborate recent evidence of strong influence of subject motion on estimated functional connectivity measures and strongly suggest that studies using RSFC measures as imaging phenotypes should adjust for individual differences in in-scanner subject motion",

The results showed that ReHo of RS-fMRI signals could successfully predict SSRT.

Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties-supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost-which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission.},

What remains unclear, however, is how individual differences in personality traits interact with cingulate functionality in the prediction of stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity. Accordingly, we tested the associations between (i) a particular personality trait, Agreeableness, which is associated with emotional reactions to conflict, (ii) resting state functional connectivity within the cingulate cortex, and (iii) stressor-evoked blood pressure (BP) reactivity. Participants (N=39, 19 men, aged 20-37 years) completed a resting functional connectivity MRI protocol, followed by two standardized stressor tasks that engaged conflict processing and evoked BP reactivity. Agreeableness covaried positively with BP reactivity across individuals. Moreover, connectivity analyses demonstrated that a more positive functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate (BA31) and the perigenual anterior cingulate (BA32) covaried positively with Agreeableness and with BP reactivity. Finally, statistical mediation analyses demonstrated that BA31-BA32 connectivity mediated the covariation between Agreeableness and BP reactivity. Functional connectivity within the cingulate appears to link Agreeableness and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stressor-evoked BP reactivity.",

With increasing sleep depth, contributions of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/retrosplenial cortex (RspC), parahippocampal gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex to the DMN decreased. CCA revealed a breakdown of corticocortical functional connectivity, particularly between the posterior and anterior midline node of the DMN and the DMN and the ACN. Dynamic tracking of the DMN from wakefulness into slow wave sleep in a single subject added insights into intraindividual network fluctuations. Results resonate with a role of the PCC/RspC for the regulation of consciousness.

The rsBOLD data was analyzed using two types of fractal dimension (FD) analysis based on relative dispersion and frequency power spectrum. Comparisons in FD were performed between AD and NC, and FD measures were correlated with (1)H-MRS findings. RESULTS: Temporal fractal analysis of rsBOLD, was able to differentiate AD from NC subjects (P = 0.03). Low FD correlated with markers of AD severity including decreased concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (R = 0.44, P = 0.015) and increased myoinositol (mI) (R = -0.45, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Based on these results we suggest fractal analysis of rsBOLD could provide an early marker of AD",

    abstract = {Task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (TF-fMRI) has great potential for advancing the understanding and treatment of neurologic illness. However, as with all measures of neural activity, variability is a hallmark of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) identified by TF-fMRI. This variability has hampered efforts to define a robust metric of connectivity suitable as a biomarker for neurologic illness. We hypothesized that some of this variability rather than representing noise in the measurement process, is related to a fundamental feature of connectivity within ICNs, which is their non-stationary nature. To test this hypothesis, we used a large (n = 892) population-based sample of older subjects to construct a well characterized atlas of 68 functional regions, which were categorized based on independent component analysis network of origin, anatomical locations, and a functional meta-analysis. These regions were then used to construct dynamic graphical representations of brain connectivity within a sliding time window for each subject. This allowed us to demonstrate the non-stationary nature of the brain's modular organization and assign each region to a "meta-modular" group. Using this grouping, we then compared dwell time in strong sub-network configurations of the default mode network (DMN) between 28 subjects with Alzheimer's dementia and 56 cognitively normal elderly subjects matched 1:2 on age, gender, and education. We found that differences in connectivity we and others have previously observed in Alzheimer's disease can be explained by differences in dwell time in DMN sub-network configurations, rather than steady state connectivity magnitude. DMN dwell time in specific modular configurations may also underlie the TF-fMRI findings that have been described in mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal subjects who are at risk for Alzheimer's dementia. © 2012 Jones et al.},

    abstract = "The objective of this review is to evaluate recent advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research in Alzheimer's disease for the development of therapeutic agents. The basic building block underpinning cognition is a brain network. The measured brain activity serves as an integrator of the various components, from genes to structural integrity, that impact the function of networks underpinning cognition. Specific networks can be interrogated using cognitive paradigms such as a learning task or a working memory task. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of neural networks allow one to investigate the function of a brain network by investigating the inherent coherency of the brain networks that can be measured during resting state. The coherent resting state networks allow testing in cognitively impaired patients that may not be possible with the use of cognitive paradigms. In particular the default mode network (DMN) includes the medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate, two key regions that support episodic memory function and are impaired in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By investigating the effects of a prospective drug compound on this network, it could illuminate the specificity of the compound with a network supporting memory function. This could provide valuable information on the methods of action at physiological and behaviourally relevant levels. Utilizing fMRI opens up new areas of research and a new approach for drug development, as it is an integrative tool to investigate entire networks within the brain. The network based approach provides a new independent method from previous ones to translate preclinical knowledge into the clinical domain.",

Imaging techniques using magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) provide measures of white matter microstructure and gray functional activation, respectively.OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that patients with COPD would have reduced white matter integrity and that functional communication between gray matter resting-state networks would be significantly different to control subjects. In addition, we tested whether observed differences related to disease severity, cerebrovascular comorbidity, and cognitive dysfunction.METHODS: DTI and rfMRI were acquired in stable nonhypoxemic patients with COPD (n = 25) and compared with age-matched control subjects (n = 25). Demographic, disease severity, stroke risk, and neuropsychologic assessments were made.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with COPD (mean age, 68; FEV(1) 53 ± 21\% predicted) had widespread reduction in white matter integrity (46\% of white matter tracts; P < 0.01). Six of the seven resting-state networks showed increased functional gray matter activation in COPD (P < 0.01). Differences in DTI, but not rfMRI, remained significant after controlling for stroke risk and smoking (P < 0.05). White matter integrity and gray matter activation seemed to account for difference in cognitive performance between patients with COPD and control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: In stable nonhypoxemic COPD there is reduced white matter integrity throughout the brain and widespread disturbance in functional activation of gray matter, which may contribute to cognitive dysfunction. White matter microstructural integrity but not gray matter functional activation is independent of smoking and cerebrovascular comorbidity. The mechanisms remain unclear, but may include cerebral small vessel disease caused by COPD",

However, little is known about the DMN in children with medically refractory epilepsy. The aim was to determine whether there was a difference in the DMN in children with medically refractory epilepsy relative to controls.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Eleven children with medically refractory epilepsy and 11 age-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI. IC analysis was used to identify the DMN. A random-effects analysis was performed on the Z-maps of the DMN within each group and between groups. We calculated the temporal correlation coefficients of pairs of ROIs: PCC/PCUN, mPFC, and left and right lateral parietal cortices. The relations between z scores of temporal correlation coefficients of pairs of ROIs and clinical seizure parameters and IQ were assessed.RESULTS:The patients demonstrated decreased DMN connectivity in the PCC/PCUN, bilateral lateral parietal cortex, and anterior and midcingulate relative to controls. There was reduced connectivity between the mPFC-right lateral parietal cortex, the PCC/PCUN-left lateral parietal cortex, and the PCC/PCUN-right lateral parietal cortex pairs of ROIs in patients compared with controls. There were no significant correlations between the z scores of temporal correlation coefficients of the 6 pairs of ROIs in patients and age of seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, number of medications, seizure frequency, and IQ.CONCLUSIONS:We have found reduced connectivity in the DMN in children with medically refractory epilepsy. Further studies are needed to determine whether different seizure types have different effects on the DMN and whether the impaired connectivity is related to cognitive functions subserved by the DMN",

Here we map interactions across different spatial scales by estimating the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity for the local (<or=14 mm) neighborhood directly surrounding brain regions as contrasted with distant (>14 mm) interactions. The balance between local and distant functional interactions measured at rest forms a map that separates sensorimotor cortices from heteromodal association areas and further identifies regions that possess both high local and distant cortical-cortical interactions. Map estimates of network measures demonstrate that high local connectivity is most often associated with a high clustering coefficient, long path length, and low physical cost. Task performance changed the balance between local and distant functional coupling in a subset of regions, particularly, increasing local functional coupling in regions engaged by the task. The observed properties suggest that the brain has evolved a balance that optimizes information-processing efficiency across different classes of specialized areas as well as mechanisms to modulate coupling in support of dynamically changing processing demands. We discuss the implications of these observations and applications of the present method for exploring normal and atypical brain function",

The impairment of posterior cingulate and precuneus could be an important marker to distinguish aMCI from healthy aging in the resting-state.

    abstract = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by macroscopic cerebral damages which can be studied in vivo with neuroimaging techniques, even at the earliest stage. Studies were conducted in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who best represent incipient AD. Right temporo-parietal hypometabolism, assessed by resting-state (18)FDG-PET, distinguishes patients who further develop AD from those who remain stable. From the pre-dementia stage of MCI, atrophy of the hippocampal region detected with structural MRI contrasts with functional alteration of the posterior cingulate gyrus measured with (18)FDG-PET and SPECT. Results from resting-state fMRI confirm this pattern of functional abnormalities and highlight changes in the hippocampal region functional connectivity, decreased with the posterior cingulate region, and increased with some frontal areas. Altogether with a structural connectivity impairment highlighted by DTI, those results support the hypothesis of a dysconnexion between the hippocampal and the posterior cingulate regions. Finally, activation fMRI data support the hypothesis of a functional compensation involving not only the frontal cortex but also, at the pre-dementia stage, the hippocampal region. Thus, this synthesis focuses on the hypotheses of dysconnexion and functional compensation, suggested to explain the discrepancies between the structural and functional alteration patterns, as well as on relevant results from resting-state fMRI, DTI and activation fMRI studies.

It has been suggested that this abnormal activity which persists into recovery might underpin the neurobiology of the disorder and constitute a neural biomarker for AN. However, no study to date has assessed functional changes in neural networks in the absence of task-induced activity in those recovered from AN. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whole brain resting state functional connectivity in nonmedicated women recovered from anorexia nervosa. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 16 nonmedicated participants recovered from anorexia nervosa and 15 healthy control participants. Independent component analysis revealed functionally relevant resting state networks. Dual regression analysis revealed increased temporal correlation (coherence) in the default mode network (DMN) which is thought to be involved in self-referential processing. Specifically, compared to healthy control participants the recovered anorexia nervosa participants showed increased temporal coherence between the DMN and the precuneus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/inferior frontal gyrus. The findings support the view that dysfunction in resting state functional connectivity in regions involved in self-referential processing and cognitive control might be a vulnerability marker for the development of anorexia nervosa.

Further correlative analyses revealed that the increase in rSFG connectivity was robustly positively correlated with non-memory performance in aMCI GSK-3$\beta$ rs334558 TT/CT carriers.

Neural activity and connectivity within the default network, which are correlated with cognitive ability even at rest, may be plausible intermediate phenotypes that will enable us to understand the genetic mechanisms of individuals' cognitive function or the risk for genetic brain diseases. Using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging and imaging genetic paradigms, we investigated whether individual default network connectivity was modulated by COMT val(158)met in 57 healthy young subjects. Compared with COMT heterozygous individuals, homozygous val individuals showed significantly decreased prefrontal-related connectivities, which primarily occurred between prefrontal regions and the posterior cingulate/restrosplenial cortices. Further analyses of the topological characteristics of the default network showed homozygous val individuals had significantly fewer node degrees in the prefrontal regions. This finding may partially elucidate previous reports that the COMT val variant is associated with inefficient prefrontal information processing and poor cognitive performance. Our findings suggest that default network connectivity that involves the prefrontal cortex is modulated by COMT val(158)met through differential effects on prefrontal dopamine levels",

    abstract = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to detect and delineate regions of the brain that change their level of activation in response to specific stimuli and tasks. Simple activation maps depict only the average level of engagement of different regions within distributed systems. FMRI potentially can reveal additional information about the degree to which components of large-scale neural systems are functionally coupled together to achieve specific tasks. In order to better understand how brain regions contribute to functionally connected circuits, it is necessary to record activation maps either as a function of different conditions, at different times or in different subjects. Data obtained under different conditions may then be analyzed by a variety of techniques to infer correlations and couplings between nodes in networks. Several multivariate statistical methods have been adapted and applied to analyze variations within such data. An approach of particular interest that is suited to studies of connectivity within single subjects makes use of acquisitions of runs of MRI images obtained while the brain is in a so-called steady state, either at rest (i.e., without any specific stimulus or task) or in a condition of continuous activation. Interregional correlations between fluctuations of MRI signal potentially reveal functional connectivity. Recent studies have established that interregional correlations between different components of circuits in each of the visual, language, motor and working memory systems can be detected in the resting state. Correlations at baseline are changed during the performance of a continuous task. In this review, various methods available for assessing connectivity are described and evaluated",

This study explored the feasibility of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with behavioral measures to target dynamic changes in specific neural circuitries in an animal model of traumatic brain injury. Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups (traumatic brain injury / sham operation). TBI rats were subjected to the closed head injury (CHI) model. Any observable motor deficits and cognitive deficits associated with the injury were measured using Beam Walk and Morris Water Maze tests, respectively. fMRI was performed to assess the underlying post-traumatic cerebral anatomy and function in acute (24 hours after the injury) and chronic (7 and 21 days after the injury) phases. Beam Walk test results detected no significant differences in motor deficits between groups. Morris Water Maze test indicated that cognitive deficits persisted for the first week following injury and to a large extent, recovered thereafter. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis detected initially diminished connectivity between cortical areas involved in cognition for the TBI group; however the connectivity patterns normalized at one week and remained so at three weeks post-injury timepoint. Taken together, we have demonstrated an objective in vivo marker for mapping functional brain changes correlated with injury-associated cognitive behavior deficits and offer an animal model for testing potential therapeutic interventions options",

To this aim, we assessed, using resting-state (RS) fMRI, intrinsic FC and functional network connectivity (FNC) of brain large-scale neuronal networks from 85 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 40 matched controls.METHODS: Independent component analysis was used to analyze RS fMRI data. Intrinsic FC of each cluster of each RS network (RSN) was compared between controls and patients (analysis of variance adjusted for age, gender, and gray matter volume). The FNC toolbox was used to assess interactions among RSNs.RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with RRMS experienced a decreased RS FC in regions of the salience (SN), executive control (ECN), working memory (WMN), default mode (DMN), sensorimotor, and visual networks. They also had an increased RS FC in regions of the ECN and auditory RSN. Decreased RS FC was significantly correlated with disability and T2 lesion volumes. In patients with RRMS, when compared to controls, FNC analysis showed that the ECN had an increased connectivity with the SN and a decreased connectivity with the DMN. An abnormal connectivity between the WMNs and sensory networks was also found.CONCLUSIONS: Functional abnormalities within and between large-scale neuronal networks occur in patients with RRMS and are related to the extent of T2 lesions and the severity of disability. Longitudinal studies should ascertain whether such functional abnormalities confer a systematic vulnerability to disease progression or, conversely, protect against the onset of clinical deficits",

The authors chose, a priori, 58 seed regions to evaluate previously described cortical neural networks by computing temporal correlations between all seed region pairs. Seed regions whose correlations significantly differed between rest and maneuver (P < .05, uncorrected) entered into a second-stage analysis of computing the correlation coefficient between the seed region and time courses in each of the remaining brain voxels. A threshold-free cluster enhancement permutation analysis evaluated the distribution of these correlation coefficients after transformation to Fisher z scores and registration to a surface-based reconstruction using Freesurfer.Results. The median age for the 16 subjects was 54 years (range, 27-72 years), and all had subjective, unilateral or bilateral, nonpulsatile tinnitus for 6 months or longer. In 9 subjects who could voluntarily increase the loudness of their tinnitus, there were no significant differences in functional connectivity in any cortical networks. A separate analysis evaluated results from 3 patients who decreased the loudness of their tinnitus. Four subjects were excluded because of excessive motion in the scanner.Conclusion. The absence of significant differences in functional connectivity due to voluntary orofacial maneuvers that increased tinnitus loudness failed to confirm prior reports of altered cerebral blood flows during somatomotor behaviors",

This correspondence between activation and rest has been explored with a large repertoire of computational methods, ranging from analysis of pairwise interactions between areas of the brain to the global brain networks yielded by independent component analysis. In this paper we describe an alternative method based on the averaging of the BOLD signal at a region of interest (target) triggered by spontaneous increments in activity at another brain area (seed). The resting BOLD event triggered averages ("rBeta") can be used to estimate functional connectivity at resting state. Using two simple examples, here we illustrate how the analysis of the average response triggered by spontaneous increases/decreases in the BOLD signal is sufficient to capture the aforementioned correspondence in a variety of circumstances. The computation of the non linear response during rest here described allows for a direct comparison with results obtained during task performance, providing an alternative measure of functional interaction between brain areas.},

However, the effects physiological and imaging artifacts are also greatly increased. Traditional statistical parametric mapping theories based on distributional properties representative of data acquired at lower fields may be inadequate for new 7T data. Herein, we investigate the model fitting residuals based on two 7T and one 3T protocols. We find that model residuals are substantively more non-Gaussian at 7T relative to 3T. Imaging slices that passed through regions with peak inhomogeneity problems (e.g., mid-brain acquisitions for the 7T hippocampus) exhibited visually higher degrees of distortion along with spatially correlated and extreme values of kurtosis (a measure of non-Gaussianity). The impacts of artifacts have been previously addressed for 3T data by estimating the covariance matrix of the regression errors. We further extend the robust estimation approach for autoregressive models and evaluate the qualitative impacts of this technique relative to traditional inference. Clear differences in statistical significance are shown between inferences based on classical versus robust assumptions, which suggest that inferences based on Gaussian assumptions are subject to practical (as well as theoretical) concerns regarding their power and validity. Hence, modern statistical approaches, such as the robust autoregressive model posed herein, are appropriate and suitable for inference with ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging",

    abstract = "The apolipoprotein (APOE) $\epsilon$4 allele is a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intrinsic fluctuations of brain activity measured by fMRI during rest may be sensitive to AD-related neuropathology. In particular, functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) has gained recent attention as a possible biomarker of disease processes and associated memory decline in AD. Here, we tested the hypothesis of APOE-related alterations in DMN functional connectivity in 95 healthy individuals between 50 and 80 years of age, including 33 carriers of the $\epsilon$4 allele. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized increased hippocampal DMN synchronization in APOE $\epsilon$4 carriers. This was supported using independent component analysis in combination with a dual-regression approach for analysis of resting state data. Whole-brain analysis suggested effects also in other areas, including the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, and parahippocampal regions. DMN synchronization showed a negative correlation with performance on a test of memory functioning, suggesting a neurocognitive significance of the brain activity patterns during rest. Our findings indicate that increased genetic vulnerability for AD is reflected in increased hippocampal DMN synchronization during rest several years before clinical manifestation. We propose that the results reflect $\epsilon$4-related failure in hippocampal decoupling, which might elevate the total hippocampal metabolic burden and increase the risk of cognitive decline and AD. The results provide an important confirmation of specific genotype effects on intrinsic fluctuations and support the use of functional connectivity indices as imaging-derived endophenotypes in the emerging field of imaging genetics.",

Empirical tools to study network coupling include fMRI-based functional and/or effective connectivity, and EEG/MEG-based measures of neuronal synchronization. Here we use simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI to assess whether fMRI-based BOLD connectivity and frequency-specific EEG power are related. Using data collected during resting state, we studied whether posterior EEG alpha power fluctuations are correlated with connectivity within the visual network and between visual cortex and the rest of the brain. The results show that when alpha power increases BOLD connectivity between primary visual cortex and occipital brain regions decreases and that the negative relation of the visual cortex with anterior/medial thalamus decreases and ventral-medial prefrontal cortex is reduced in strength. These effects were specific for the alpha band, and not observed in other frequency bands. Decreased connectivity within the visual system may indicate enhanced functional inhibition during higher alpha activity. This higher inhibition level also attenuates long-range intrinsic functional antagonism between visual cortex and other thalamic and cortical regions. Together, these results illustrate that power fluctuations in posterior alpha oscillations result in local and long range neural connectivity changes",

In monkeys, STS is connected with the cerebellum, which is also involved in motor, emotional, and cognitive functions. However, in humans, very few data are available concerning the functional connectivity of polymodal STS in general and its functional links with the cerebellum, in particular. This study was therefore designed to investigate the intrinsically connected network of STS during the brain resting state with possible involvement of the cerebellum. METHODS: Data from 14 right-handed healthy volunteers were acquired at rest and analyzed by region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations of separate six ROIs located in the right and left posterior, medial, and anterior STS were successively used to identify significant temporal correlations with BOLD signal fluctuations of other brain regions. RESULTS: Low-frequency BOLD signals of the right and left posterior, medial, and lateral STS share a common bilateral circuit encompassing the ventrolateral prefrontal, premotor/motor, insular, parietal temporal, occipital, and cerebellar cortices (lobules VI/VIIA), thalamus, and striatum. CONCLUSION: The STS-centered network (1) is intrinsically connected during the brain resting, (2) encompasses the whole caudalmost two thirds of STS, (3) may partly represent the whole STS structural connectivity, and includes the motor and cognitive neocerebellum (lobules VI/VIIA).",

Region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity analysis was employed to identify the potential differences in the functional connectivity of the thalamus between the two groups.RESULTS: In the PTSD group, the thalamus-ROIs showed decreased positive functional connectivity to particular brain regions including right medial frontal gyrus and left anterior cingulate cortex. Importantly, we also found increased positive functional connectivity of thalamus-ROIs with bilateral inferior frontal and left middle frontal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule as well as right precuneus in the PTSD participants when compared to traumatized controls without PTSD.CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that abnormal resting state functional connections linking the thalamus to cortical regions may be involved in the underlying pathology in PTSD.",

In drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, resting functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have primarily employed region of interest approaches that preclude a comprehensive evaluation of large-scale functional interactions. In line with the distributed nature of structural damage in this condition, we set out to quantify connectivity across the entire range of resting networks. Furthermore, we assessed whether connectivity is driven by co-localized structural pathology. We obtained resting state, diffusion tensor and anatomical imaging data in 35 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and 20 healthy subjects on a 3 T scanner. Resting state networks were identified using independent component analysis, which allows an objective whole-brain quantification of functional connectivity. We performed group comparisons before and after correcting for voxel-wise grey matter density. In addition, we identified voxel-wise associations between resting connectivity and white matter coherence indexed by fractional anisotropy. Compared with controls, patients showed altered (typically reduced) functional connectivity between the hippocampus, anterior temporal, precentral cortices and the default mode and sensorimotor networks. Reduced network integration of the hippocampus was explained by variations in grey matter density, while functional connectivity of the parahippocampus, and frontal and temporal neocortices showed atypical associations with white matter coherence within pathways carrying connections of these regions. Our multimodal imaging study suggests that in temporal lobe epilepsy, cortical atrophy and microstructural white matter damage impact functional resting connectivity",

Impairments in cognitive functions such as memory and language have been well addressed, but perceptual deficits have only been considered in terms of behavioral data. Little imaging research on perceptual deficits in mTLE has been reported. The present study is expected to reveal impairments in the perceptual networks in patients with mTLE using fMRI. The fMRI-based independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to 33 patients with mTLE and 33 matched healthy controls. In light of the resting-state networks (RSNs) corresponding to the basal functions of visual, auditory, and sensorimotor systems, the ICA data of functional connectivity within these RSNs were compared between the patients and controls. Compared with the controls, the mTLE patients presented decreased functional connectivity within the regions of the auditory and sensorimotor networks, as well increased functional connectivity in the primary visual cortex and decreased functional connectivity in the bilateral MT+ areas of the visual network. Our neuroimaging results are in agreement with the previous findings that specific perceptual functions are impaired in mTLE. Furthermore, our findings in the visual network support the belief that the primary visual function is not impaired and that there may be deficits in the high-order visual function in mTLE. Our fMRI study may contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying perceptual impairments in mTLE",

    title = "{Functional organization of complex brain networks modulated by acupuncture at different acupoints belonging to the same anatomic segment.}",
    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noninvasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have opened a "window" into the brain, allowing us to investigate the anatomical and physiological function involving acupuncture needling. Imaging its sustained effect rather than acute effect on the brain networks may further help elucidate the mechanisms by which acupuncture achieves its therapeutic effects. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional brain networks during the post-resting state following acupuncture at KI3 in comparison with acupuncture at GB40.METHODS: Needling at acupoints GB40 and KI3 was performed in twelve subjects. Six minutes of scanning at rest were adopted before and after acupuncture at different acupoints. Then we divided the whole brain into 39 regions and constructed functional brain networks during the post-acupuncture resting states (PARS).RESULTS: For direct comparisons, increased correlations during post-resting state following acupuncture at KI3 compared to resting state (RS) were primarily located between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and post temporal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and post temporal cortex. These brain regions were all cognitive-related functions. In contrast, the increased connections between the anterior insula and temporal cortex mainly emerged following acupuncture at GB40 compared with the RS.CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that acupuncture at different acupoints belonging to the same anatomic segment can exert different modulatory effects on the reorganizations of post-acupuncture RS networks. The heterogeneous modulation patterns between two conditions may relate to the functional specific modulatory effects of acupuncture},

We obtained 90 longitudinal fcMRI data sets from a cohort of preterm infants aged from 26 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) through term equivalent age at PMA-specific time points. Utilizing seed-based correlation analysis, we identified resting state networks involving varied cortical regions, the thalamus, and cerebellum. Identified networks demonstrated a regionally variable age-specific pattern of development, with more mature forms consisting of localized interhemispheric connections between homotopic counterparts. Anatomical distance was found to play a critical role in the rate of connection development. Prominent differences were noted between networks identified in term control versus premature infants at term equivalent, including in the thalamocortical connections critical for neurodevelopment. Putative precursors of the default mode network were detected in term control infants but were not identified in preterm infants, including those at term equivalent. Identified patterns of network maturation reflect the intricate relationship of structural and functional processes present throughout this important developmental period and are consistent with prior investigations of neurodevelopment in this population.",

    abstract = "It has been widely reported that structural and functional connectivities are disturbed in cortical networks in schizophrenia (SZ). However, much less is known about the structural and functional connectivities between cortical and subcortical regions in SZ. Here, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data was used to identify consistent cortico-subcortical structural connection patterns across SZ patients and controls, and thus 13 common cortical Regions of Interest (ROIs) were determined. DTI and resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets were used to assess the structural and functional connectivities between the 13 cortical ROIs and 12 subcortical regions in 8 SZ patients and 10 normal controls. It was found that there are significantly increased functional connectivities for 7 cortico-subcortical connections between the 13 cortical ROIs and 12 subcortical regions. Among most of these connections, the functional connectivity strength was doubled in SZ in comparison to controls. The cortical ROIs with functional hyper-connectivities to subcortical regions are localized in frontal and parietal lobes. However, no significant difference in the structural connectivity between these cortical and subcortical regions was found between SZ and controls. Additional analysis results showed 4 significantly increased and 2 significantly decreased cortico-cortical connections. Our study results suggest the functional hyper-connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions, adding further evidence to literature findings that SZ is a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. The result of either increased or decreased functional connectivities among cortical ROIs exhibits the complex pattern of disturbance of brain networks in SZ.",

This study examined whether resting functional connectivity (FC) of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) with other structures can distinguish apathetic depressed older patients from non-apathetic depressed patients and normal subjects. METHODS: Twenty-six non-demented, non-MCI older adults were studied. Of these, 16 had major depression (7 also had apathy) and 10 had no psychopathology. Resting state fMRI was performed prior to treatment in subjects who were psychotropic-free for at least two weeks. FC was determined by placing seeds in the NAcc and the dACC bilaterally. RESULTS: Apathetic depressed patients had lower FC of the NAcc with the amygdala, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus and increased FC with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the superior frontal cortex, and the insula than non-apathetic patients. Further, apathetic patients had lower FC of the dACC with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and higher FC with the insula and the orbitofrontal cortex than non-apathetic patients. LIMITATIONS: Small number of subjects, lack of random sampling, use of a 1.5T MRI scanner. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FC between the NAcc and the dACC and structures related to reward and related behavioral responses constitute the functional topography of abnormalities characterizing apathy of late life depression. However, replication is needed",

    abstract = "The human brain functions as an efficient system where signals arising from gray matter are transported via white matter tracts to other regions of the brain to facilitate human behavior. However, with a few exceptions, functional and structural neuroimaging data are typically optimized to maximize the quantification of signals arising from a single source. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is typically used as an index of gray matter functioning whereas diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is typically used to determine white matter properties. While it is likely that these signals arising from different tissue sources contain complementary information, the signal processing algorithms necessary for the fusion of neuroimaging data across imaging modalities are still in a nascent stage. In the current paper we present a data-driven method for combining measures of functional connectivity arising from gray matter sources (FMRI resting state data) with different measures of white matter connectivity (DTI). Specifically, a joint independent component analysis (J-ICA) was used to combine these measures of functional connectivity following intensive signal processing and feature extraction within each of the individual modalities. Our results indicate that one of the most predominantly used measures of functional connectivity (activity in the default mode network) is highly dependent on the integrity of white matter connections between the two hemispheres (corpus callosum) and within the cingulate bundles. Importantly, the discovery of this complex relationship of connectivity was entirely facilitated by the signal processing and fusion techniques presented herein and could not have been revealed through separate analyses of both data types as is typically performed in the majority of neuroimaging experiments. We conclude by discussing future applications of this technique to other areas of neuroimaging and examining potential limitations of the methods.",

Cognitive tests were also administered. All of the participants were middle-aged adults. The analysis revealed no cognitive or white matter FA differences between carriers and non-carriers.

In this study, we evaluated effects of a set of structured multimodal activities (Combination Training; CT) on cognitive performances, functional connectivity, and cortical thickness of a group of healthy elderly individuals. CT lasted six months.METHODOLOGY: Neuropsychological and occupational performances were evaluated before and at the end of the training period. fMRI was used to assess effects of training on resting state network (RSN) functional connectivity using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Effects on cortical thickness were also studied. Finally, we evaluated whether specific dopamine-related genes can affect the response to training.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results of the study indicate that CT improves cognitive/occupational performances and reorganizes functional connectivity. Intriguingly, individuals responding to CT showed specific dopamine-related genotypes. Indeed, analysis of dopamine-related genes revealed that carriers of DRD3 ser9gly and COMT Val158Met polymorphisms had the greatest benefits from exposure to CT.CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, our findings support the idea that exposure to a set of structured multimodal activities can be an effective strategy to counteract aging-related cognitive decline and also indicate that significant capability of functional and structural changes are maintained in the elderly",

The brain possesses the small world topology immediately after birth, followed by a remarkable improvement in whole brain wiring efficiency in 1 yr olds and becomes more stable in 2 yr olds. Regional developments of brain wiring efficiency and the evolution of functional hubs suggest differential development trend for primary and higher order cognitive functions during the first two years of life. Simulations of random errors and targeted attacks reveal an age-dependent improvement of resilience. The lower resilience to targeted attack observed in 3 wk old group is likely due to the fact that there are fewer well-established long-distance functional connections at this age whose elimination might have more profound implications in the overall efficiency of information transfer.

Although focal structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain regions have been widely studied in populations with OCD, changes in the functional relations among them remain poorly understood. This study examined OCD-related alterations in functional connectivity patterns in the brain's top-down control network.METHODS: We applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the correlation patterns of intrinsic or spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuations in 18 patients with OCD and 16 healthy controls. The brain control networks were first constructed by thresholding temporal correlation matrices of 39 brain regions associated with top-down control and then analyzed using graph theory-based approaches.RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the patients with OCD showed decreased functional connectivity in the posterior temporal regions and increased connectivity in various control regions such as the cingulate, precuneus, thalamus and cerebellum. Furthermore, the brain's control networks in the healthy controls showed small-world architecture (high clustering coefficients and short path lengths), suggesting an optimal balance between modularized and distributed information processing. In contrast, the patients with OCD showed significantly higher local clustering, implying abnormal functional organization in the control network. Further analysis revealed that the changes in network properties occurred in regions of increased functional connectivity strength in patients with OCD. Limitations: The patient group in the present study was heterogeneous in terms of symptom clusters, and most of the patients with OCD were medicated.CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that the organizational patterns of intrinsic brain activity in the control networks are altered in patients with OCD and thus provide empirical evidence for aberrant functional connectivity in the large-scale brain systems in people with this disorder.",

    abstract = {The network of regions shown by functional imaging studies to be deactivated by experimental tasks relative to nominally more passive baselines (task < baseline) may reflect processes engaged during the resting state or "default mode." Deactivation may result when attention and resources are diverted from default-mode processes toward task processes. Aging is associated with altered patterns of deactivation which may be related to declining resources, difficulties with resource allocation, or both. These possibilities predict that greater task demand, which increases deactivation levels in younger adults, should exacerbate age-related declines in allocating resources away from the default mode. The present study investigated the magnitude and temporal properties of deactivations in young and older adults during tasks that varied in their demand for cognitive control. Two versions of a verb generation task that varied in their demand for selection among competing alternatives were compared to word reading and a fixation baseline condition. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater deactivations were found with increasing demand. Young and older adults showed equivalent deactivations in the minimal selection condition. By contrast, age differences in both the magnitude and time course of deactivation increased with selection demand: Compared to young adults', older adults' deactivation response showed less sensitivity to demand. Demand-related changes in deactivation magnitude correlated with performance changes, suggesting that individual and group differences in deactivation have functional significance},

These fMRI fluctuations became rapidly spatially de-correlated (39\% drop in correlation level, P < 0.008) during visual stimulation. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the slow spontaneous fluctuations during rest had consistent and specific neuro-anatomical distribution which argued against purely hemodynamic noise sources.

    abstract = "Chronic alcoholism is known to disrupt functions served by distributed brain systems, including limbic and frontocerebellar circuits involved in resting-state and task-activated networks subserving component processes of memory often affected in alcoholics. Using an fMRI paradigm, we investigated whether memory performance by alcoholics on a face-name association test previously observed to be problematic for alcoholics could be explained by desynchronous activity between nodes of these specific networks. While in the scanner, 18 alcoholics and 15 controls performed a face-name associative learning task with different levels of processing at encoding. This task was designed to activate the hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex. Alcoholics and controls were also scanned at rest. Twelve alcoholics and 12 controls were selected to be matched on face-name recognition performance. Task-related fMRI analysis indicated that alcoholics had preserved limbic activation but lower cerebellar activation (Crus II) than the controls in the face-name learning task. Crus II was, therefore, chosen as a seed for functional connectivity MRI analysis. At rest, the left hippocampus and left Crus II had positively synchronized activity in controls, while hippocampal and cerebellar activities were negatively synchronized in alcoholics. Task engagement resulted in hippocampal-cerebellar desynchronization in both groups. We speculate that atypical cerebello-hippocampal activity synchronization during rest in alcoholics was reset to the normal pattern of asynchrony by task engagement. Aberrations from the normal pattern of resting-state default mode synchrony could be interpreted as enabling preserved face-name associative memory in alcoholism",

Neural exaggeration in limbic (amygdala) and paralimbic (insula) regions appears to be associated with functional outcomes involving increased attention for and processing of social threat. Evidence is also reviewed showing that social anxiety is characterized by atypical functional connectivity in certain brain networks. Despite a higher prevalence of social anxiety disorder among females, males have been overrepresented in the published clinical studies (constituting approximately 56\% of the total participants). We evaluate the prospects of nonhuman animal models of social anxiety and discuss several promising directions for future research.

    abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) has become one of the leading methods for brain mapping in neuroscience. Recent advances in fMRI analysis were used to define the default state of brain activity, functional connectivity and basal activity. Basal activity measured with fMRI raised tremendous interest among neuroscientists since synchronized brain activity pattern could be retrieved while the subject rests (resting state fMRI). During recent years, a few signal processing schemes have been suggested to analyze the resting state blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from simple correlations to spectral decomposition. In most of these analysis schemes, the question asked was which brain areas "behave" in the time domain similarly to a pre-specified ROI. In this work we applied short time frequency analysis and clustering to study the spatial signal characteristics of resting state fMRI time series. Such analysis revealed that clusters of similar BOLD fluctuations are found in the cortex but also in the white matter and sub-cortical gray matter regions (thalamus). We found high similarities between the BOLD clusters and the neuro-anatomical appearance of brain regions. Additional analysis of the BOLD time series revealed a strong correlation between head movements and clustering quality. Experiments performed with T1-weighted time series also provided similar quality of clustering. These observations led us to the conclusion that non-functional contributions to the BOLD time series can also account for symmetric appearance of signal fluctuations. These contributions may include head motions, the underling microvasculature anatomy and cellular morphology},

    abstract = "Most juridical systems recognize intentional non-actions - the failure to render assistance - as intentional acts by regarding them as in principle culpable. This raises the fundamental question whether intentional non-actions can be distinguished from simply not doing anything. Classical GLM analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data reveals that not doing anything is associated with resting state brain areas whereas intentionally non-acting is associated with brain activity in left inferior parietal lobe and left dorsal premotor cortex. By means of pattern classification we quantify the accuracy with which we can distinguish these two mental states on the basis of brain activity. In order to identify brain regions that harbour a distributed, overlapping representation of voluntary non-actions and the decision not to act we performed pattern classification on brain areas that did not appear in the GLM contrasts. The prediction rate is not reduced and we show that the prediction relies mostly on brain areas that have been associated with action production and motor imagery as supplementary motor area, right inferior frontal gyrus and right middle temporal area (V5/MT). Hence our data support the implicit assumption of legal practice that voluntary non-action shares important features with overt voluntary action.",

When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.",

No study to date, however, has investigated resting-state DMN in relatively early depression before years of medication treatment. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the DMN in patients seeking help from specialized mental health services for the first time for symptoms of depression.METHODS: Fourteen depressed subjects and 15 matched controls were scanned using 4-T functional magnetic resonance imaging while resting with eyes closed. All but one subject was medication free. A precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (P/PCC) seed-region connectivity analysis was used to identify the DMN and compare study groups in regions of relevance to depression.RESULTS: The P/PCC analysis identified the DMN well in both study groups, consistent with prior literature. Direct comparison showed significantly reduced correlation between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate in depression compared with controls and no areas of increased connectivity in the depressed group.CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first to investigate resting-state DMN in the early stages of treatment-seeking for depression. Depressed subjects had decreased connectivity between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate, regions known to be involved in motivation and reward processing. Deficits in DMN connectivity with the caudate may be an early manifestation of major depressive disorder",

Twenty-eight right-handed subjects (14 MCI patients and 14 healthy elders) participated in this study. Clinical and neuropsychological examinations were performed on all the subjects. PCC functional connectivity was studied by examining the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the PCC and those in all the other brain regions. Additionally, we traced all the MCI patients and compared their PCC connectivity in the initial stage and that in 3 years later. We also explored the relationship between the PCC functional connectivity strength and cognitive performances. Our results are as follows: Functional connectivity between the PCC and a set of regions is decreased in MCI patients. Most of these regions are within the default mode network (DMN). Three years later, the regions of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG) presented further decreased connectivity to the PCC in MCI. In addition, we also find enhanced functional connectivity between PCC and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), PCC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in MCI patients. At last, our research also shows that the PCC connectivity with some regions significantly correlates with the cognitive performances of patients as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and California verbal learning test (CVLT) scores. The baseline and longitudinal changes of the PCC connectivity in our study suggest that impairment and compensation coexist in the disease progress of MCI patients",

Non-invasive brain imaging has, over the past several decades, contributed important new insights into the neuroplastic adaptations that result from chronic drug intake, but additional experimental approaches and neurobiological hypotheses are needed to better capture the totality of the motivational, affective, cognitive, genetic and pharmacological complexities of the disease. Recent advances in assessing network dynamics through resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may allow for such systems-level assessments. In this review, we first summarize the nascent addiction-related rsFC literature and suggest that in using this tool, circuit connectivity may inform specific neurobiological substrates underlying psychological dysfunctions associated with reward, affective and cognitive processing often observed in drug addicts. Using nicotine addiction as an exemplar, we subsequently provide a heuristic framework to guide future research by linking recent findings from intrinsic network connectivity studies with those interrogating nicotine's neuropharmacological actions. Emerging evidence supports a critical role for the insula in nicotine addiction. Likewise, the anterior insula, potentially together with the anterior cingulate cortex, appears to pivotally influence the dynamics between large-scale brain networks subserving internal (default-mode network) and external (executive control network) information processing. We suggest that a better understanding of how the insula modulates the interaction between these networks is critical for elucidating both the cognitive impairments often associated with withdrawal and the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine administration. Such an understanding may be usefully applied in the design and development of novel smoking cessation treatments",

Recent studies have shown that the functional connections of the brain network are organized in a highly efficient small-world manner, indicating a high level of local neighborhood clustering, together with the existence of more long-distance connections that ensure a high level of global communication efficiency within the overall network. Such an efficient network architecture of our functional brain raises the question of a possible association between how efficiently the regions of our brain are functionally connected and our level of intelligence. Examining the overall organization of the brain network using graph analysis, we show a strong negative association between the normalized characteristic path length lambda of the resting-state brain network and intelligence quotient (IQ). This suggests that human intellectual performance is likely to be related to how efficiently our brain integrates information between multiple brain regions. Most pronounced effects between normalized path length and IQ were found in frontal and parietal regions.

Whilst posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is believed to have a key role in a default network and be involved in the pathophysiology of AD, few studies have investigated whole-brain functional connectivity of PCC during resting state, or investigated the relationship between abnormal functional connectivity and disturbance in cognitive function in aMCI patients. Resting-state functional connectivity analysis was used to examine the temporal correlation between PCC and whole-brain regions in 30 aMCI patients and 26 well-matched controls. Further analysis involved evaluation of possible relationships between functional connectivity measures and cognitive function. Regions of decreased functional connectivity were identified in aMCI patients, most notably in temporal cortex, whilst significantly increased functional connectivity was mainly in frontal cortex. In addition, functional connectivity of PCC and temporal cortex was associated with the performance of neuropsychological tests in aMCI patients. This would be consonant with the recruitment of compensatory mechanisms and the process of offset functional impairments appearing as neuropathologic develops, and resting-state connectivity disturbance of PCC-temporal cortex may be a central role in cognitive deficit in aMCI patients.",

Both task-related and task-free network activity has been associated with individual differences in cognitive performance. Therefore, we aimed to examine the influence of cognitive expertise on four networks associated with cognitive task performance: the default mode network (DMN) and three other cognitive networks (central-executive network, dorsal attention network, and salience network). During fMRI scanning, fifteen grandmaster and master level Chinese chess players (GM/M) and fifteen novice players carried out a Chinese chess task and a task-free resting state. Modulations of network activity during task were assessed, as well as resting-state functional connectivity of those networks. Relative to novices, GM/Ms showed a broader task-induced deactivation of DMN in the chess problem-solving task, and intrinsic functional connectivity of DMN was increased with a connectivity pattern associated with the caudate nucleus in GM/Ms. The three other cognitive networks did not exhibit any difference in task-evoked activation or intrinsic functional connectivity between the two groups. These findings demonstrate the effect of long-term learning and practice in cognitive expertise on large-scale brain networks, suggesting the important role of DMN deactivation in expert performance and enhanced functional integration of spontaneous activity within widely distributed DMN-caudate circuitry, which might better support high-level cognitive control of behavior",

    abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance data acquired in a task-absent condition ("resting state") require new data analysis techniques that do not depend on an activation model. In this work, we introduce an alternative assumption- and parameter-free method based on a particular form of node centrality called eigenvector centrality. Eigenvector centrality attributes a value to each voxel in the brain such that a voxel receives a large value if it is strongly correlated with many other nodes that are themselves central within the network. Google's PageRank algorithm is a variant of eigenvector centrality. Thus far, other centrality measures - in particular "betweenness centrality" - have been applied to fMRI data using a pre-selected set of nodes consisting of several hundred elements. Eigenvector centrality is computationally much more efficient than betweenness centrality and does not require thresholding of similarity values so that it can be applied to thousands of voxels in a region of interest covering the entire cerebrum which would have been infeasible using betweenness centrality. Eigenvector centrality can be used on a variety of different similarity metrics. Here, we present applications based on linear correlations and on spectral coherences between fMRI times series. This latter approach allows us to draw conclusions of connectivity patterns in different spectral bands. We apply this method to fMRI data in task-absent conditions where subjects were in states of hunger or satiety. We show that eigenvector centrality is modulated by the state that the subjects were in. Our analyses demonstrate that eigenvector centrality is a computationally efficient tool for capturing intrinsic neural architecture on a voxel-wise level.},

Most studies consider functional connectivity networks as stationary phenomena. Consequently, the transient behavior of the DM network and its subnetworks is still largely unexplored. Most functional connectivity fMRI studies assess the steady state of resting without any task. To specifically investigate the recovery of the DM network during the transition from activation to rest, we implemented a cognitively demanding real-time fMRI neurofeedback task that targeted down-regulation of the primary auditory cortex. Each of twelve healthy subjects performed 16 block-design fMRI runs (4 runs per day repeated on 4days) resulting 192 runs in total. The analysis included data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) and high-resolution latency estimation between the four components that corresponded to subnetworks of the DM network. These different subnetworks reemerged after regulation with an average time lag or 3.3s and a time lag of 4.4s between the first and fourth components; i.e., the DM recovery first shifts from anterior to posterior, and then gradually focuses on the ventral part of the posterior cingulate cortex, which is known to be implicated in internally directed cognition. In addition, we found less reactivation in the early anterior subnetwork as regulation strength increased, but more reactivation with larger regulation for the late subnetwork that encompassed the ventral PCC. This finding confirms that the level of task engagement influences inversely the subsequent recovery of regions related to attention compared to those related to internally directed cognition",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In subjects who are performing no prescribed cognitive task, functional connectivity mapped with MR imaging (fcMRI) shows regions with synchronous fluctuations of cerebral blood flow. When specific tasks are performed, functional MR imaging (fMRI) can map locations in which regional cerebral blood flow increases synchronously with the performance of the task. We tested the hypothesis that fcMRI maps, based on the synchrony of low-frequency blood flow fluctuations, identify brain regions that show activation on fMRI maps of sensorimotor, visual, language, and auditory tasks.METHODS: In four volunteers, task-activation fMRI and functional connectivity (resting-state) fcMRI data were acquired. A small region of interest (in an area that showed maximal task activation) was chosen, and the correlation coefficient of the corresponding resting-state signal with the signal of all other voxels in the resting data set was calculated. The correlation coefficient was decomposed into frequency components and its distribution determined for each fcMRI map. The fcMRI maps were compared with the fMRI maps.RESULTS: For each task, fcMRI maps based on one to four seed voxel(s) produced clusters of voxels in regions of eloquent cortex. For each fMRI map a closely corresponding fcMRI map was obtained. The frequencies that predominated in the cross-correlation coefficients for the functionally related regions were below 0.1 Hz.CONCLUSION: Functionally related brain regions can be identified by means of their synchronous slow fluctuations in signal intensity. Such blood flow synchrony can be detected in sensorimotor areas, expressive and receptive language regions, and the visual cortex by fcMRI. Regions identified by the slow synchronous fluctuations are similar to those activated by motor, language, or visual tasks.",

    abstract = "Clustering streamline fibers derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data into functionally meaningful bundles with group-wise correspondences across individuals and populations has been a fundamental step for tract-based analysis of white matter integrity and brain connectivity modeling. Many approaches of fiber clustering reported in the literature so far used geometric and/or anatomic information derived from structural MRI and/or DTI data only. In this paper, we take a novel, alternative multimodal approach of combining resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) and DTI data, and propose to use functional coherence as the criterion to guide the clustering of fibers derived from DTI tractography. Specifically, the functional coherence between two streamline fibers is defined as their rsfMRI time series' correlations, and the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is used to cluster DTI-derived streamline fibers into bundles. Currently, we use the corpus callosum (CC) fibers, which are the largest fiber bundle in the brain, as a test-bed for methodology development and validation. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed rsfMRI-guided fiber clustering method can achieve functionally homogeneous bundles that are reasonably consistent across individuals and populations, suggesting the close relationship between structural connectivity and brain function. The clustered fiber bundles were evaluated and validated via the benchmark data provided by task-based fMRI, via reproducibility studies, and via comparison with other methods. Finally, we have applied the proposed framework on a multimodal rsfMRI/DTI dataset of schizophrenia (SZ) and reproducible results were obtained",

    abstract = "Brain oscillatory activity has long been thought to have spatial properties, the details of which are unresolved. Here we examine spatial organizational rules for the human brain oscillatory activity as measured by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Resting-state BOLD signal was transformed into frequency space (Welch's method) and averaged across subjects, and its spatial distribution was studied as a function of four frequency bands, spanning the full BOLD bandwidth. The brain showed anatomically constrained distribution of power for each frequency band. This result was replicated on a repository dataset of 195 subjects. Next, we examined larger-scale organization by parceling the neocortex into regions approximating Brodmann areas (BAs). This indicated that BAs of simple function/ connectivity (unimodal), versus complex properties (transmodal), are dominated by low-frequency BOLD oscillations, and within the visual ventral stream we observe a graded shift of power to higher-frequency bands for BAs further removed from the primary visual cortex (increased complexity), linking BOLD frequency properties to hodology. Additionally, BOLD oscillation properties for the default mode network demonstrated that it is composed of distinct frequency-dependent regions. When the same analysis was performed on a visual-motor task, frequency-dependent global and voxelwise shifts in BOLD oscillations could be detected at brain sites mostly outside those identified with general linear modeling. Thus, analysis of BOLD oscillations in full bandwidth uncovers novel brain organizational rules, linking anatomical structures and functional networks to characteristic BOLD oscillations. The approach also identifies changes in brain intrinsic properties in relation to responses to external inputs. © 2011 the authors.",

    abstract = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast are widely used to map human brain function by relating local hemodynamic responses to neuronal stimuli compared to control conditions. There is increasing interest in spontaneous cerebral BOLD fluctuations that are prominent in the low-frequency range (<0.1 Hz) and show intriguing spatio-temporal correlations in functional networks. The nature of these signal fluctuations remains unclear, but there is accumulating evidence for a neural basis opening exciting new avenues to study human brain function and its connectivity at rest. Moreover, an increasing number of patient studies report disease-dependent variation in the amplitude and spatial coherence of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations (LFBF) that may afford greater diagnostic sensitivity and easier clinical applicability than standard fMRI. The main disadvantage of this emerging tool relates to physiological (respiratory, cardiac and vasomotion) and motion confounds that are challenging to disentangle requiring thorough preprocessing. Technical aspects of functional connectivity fMRI analysis and the neuroscientific potential of spontaneous LFBF in the default mode and other resting-state networks have been recently reviewed. This review will give an update on the current knowledge of the nature of LFBF, their relation to physiological confounds and potential for clinical diagnostic and pharmacological studies",

    abstract = "Correlations between spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured with functional MRI are finding increasing use as measures of functional connectivity in the brain, where differences can potentially predict cognitive performance and diagnose disease. Caffeine, which is a widely consumed neural stimulant and vasoactive agent, has been found to decrease the amplitude and correlation of resting-state BOLD fluctuations, and hence is an important factor to consider in functional connectivity studies. However, because the BOLD signal is sensitive to neural and vascular factors, the physiological mechanisms by which caffeine alters spontaneous BOLD fluctuations remain unclear. Resting-state functional connectivity has traditionally been assessed using stationary measures, such as the correlation coefficient between BOLD signals measured across the length of a scan. However, recent work has shown that the correlation of resting-state networks can vary considerably over time, with periods as short as 10 s. In this study, we used a sliding window correlation analysis to assess temporal variations in resting-state functional connectivity of the motor cortex before and after caffeine ingestion. We found that the temporal variability of BOLD correlation was significantly higher following a caffeine dose, with transient periods of strong correlation alternating with periods of low or negative correlation. This phenomenon was primarily due to increased variability in the phase difference between BOLD time courses in the left and right motor cortices. These results indicate that caffeine may cause underlying spontaneous neural fluctuations to go in and out of coherence more frequently, and emphasizes the need to consider non-stationary measures when studying changes in functional connectivity",

Resting-state fMRIs collected from thirty-five RRMS patients and thirty-five age and sex-matched normal controls were compared to investigate the ALFF difference between the two groups. The relationships between ALFF in regions with significant group differences and the EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), disease duration, T2 lesion volume were further explored. Our results showed that RRMS patients showed no regions with decreased ALFF, while showed significantly increased ALFF in the bilateral thalami, right insula (BA 13)/ right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22). The correlation between the EDSS and ALFF in the right insula/ right superior temporal gyrus was significant. From this study, we demonstrate that increased resting state amplitudes occur in the brain of patients with RRMS, specifically in areas with extensive cortical connections. We hypothesize that this is an adaptive phenomenon, reflecting either ongoing cortical plasticity in the resting-state, or increased neuronal activity related to coordination of remapped cortical functions.",

Eighteen amnestic MCI patients and 20 healthy elderly individuals underwent the fMRI scan. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. MCI patients showed decreased ALFF in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, left lateral temporal cortex and right ventral medial prefrontal cortex and increased ALFF in the left temporal-parietal joint (TPJ) and inferior parietal lobule. The ALFF value in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex was positively correlated with the scores of Mini-Mental State Exam. Reduced medial temporal lobe activity may implicate the underlying memory impairment mechanisms in MCI. Increased TPJ and inferior parietal lobule activity may indicate the compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. These findings suggest that ALFF analysis could provide a useful tool in the fMRI study of MCI",

    abstract = "In resting-state functional MRI studies, the global signal (operationally defined as the global average of resting-state functional MRI time courses) is often considered a nuisance effect and commonly removed in preprocessing. This global signal regression method can introduce artifacts, such as false anticorrelated resting-state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Therefore, the efficacy of this technique as a correction tool remains questionable. In this article, we establish that the accuracy of the estimated global signal is determined by the level of global noise (i.e., non-neural noise that has a global effect on the resting-state functional MRI signal). When the global noise level is low, the global signal resembles the resting-state functional MRI time courses of the largest cluster, but not those of the global noise. Using real data, we demonstrate that the global signal is strongly correlated with the default mode network components and has biological significance. These results call into question whether or not global signal regression should be applied. We introduce a method to quantify global noise levels. We show that a criteria for global signal regression can be found based on the method. By using the criteria, one can determine whether to include or exclude the global signal regression in minimizing errors in functional connectivity measures.

We found that resting PMC spectral power peaked in the theta band range (4-7Hz) and was clearly distinguishable from adjacent cortical sites in the occipital lobe displaying peaks in the alpha band range (8-12Hz). Additionally, the phase of PMC theta oscillations modulated the amplitude of ongoing high gamma (70-180Hz) activity during the resting state. The magnitude of this cross-frequency modulation was shown to fluctuate at time scales comparable to those observed in functional neuroimaging studies of intrinsic functional connectivity networks (\~{}0.1Hz). The difference of canonical oscillations in the PMC compared to its adjacent cortical sites conforms to functional specialization across anatomical boundaries.

Functional connectivity analysis of the amygdala during this period might be useful in revealing brain circuits promoting adaptive recovery from a stressful event, as well as consolidation of emotionally relevant information in preparing for future challenges. Healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a psychosocial stress task (n=18; stress group) or a comparable non-stressful control procedure (n=20; controls). To study the prolonged effects of stress on amygdala functional connectivity, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired an hour after the stress task. Amygdala functional connectivity with other brain regions was assessed using seed-based correlations. The stress group exhibited a strong physiological and behavioral reaction to psychosocial stress exposure. Compared with controls the stress group showed increased amygdala functional connectivity with three cortical midline structures: the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (p<.05, corrected), and the medial prefrontal cortex (p<.05, small volume corrected). An hour after psychosocial stress, changes in amygdala functional connectivity were detected with cortical midline structures involved in the processing and regulation of emotions, as well as autobiographical memory. It is hypothesized that these effects could relate to top-down control of the amygdala and consolidation of self-relevant information after a stressful event. These results on functional connectivity in the recovery phase after stress might provide an important new vantage point in studying both sensitivity and resilience to stress.",

The review focuses on the cognitive changes associated with acute and chronic use of the drug. METHOD: We reviewed literature reporting neuroimaging studies of chronic or acute cannabis use published up until January 2009. The search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and PsycLIT indexing services using the following key words: cannabis, marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, cannabidiol, CBD, neuroimaging, brain imaging, computerized tomography, CT, magnetic resonance, MRI, single photon emission tomography, SPECT, functional magnetic resonance, fMRI, positron emission tomography, PET, diffusion tensor MRI, DTI-MRI, MRS and spectroscopy. RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were identified, of which 41 met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three were functional (SPECT/PET/fMRI) and eight structural (volumetric/DTI) imaging studies. The high degree of heterogeneity across studies precluded a meta-analysis. The functional studies suggest that resting global and prefrontal blood flow are lower in cannabis users than in controls. The results from the activation studies using a cognitive task are inconsistent because of the heterogeneity of the methods used. Studies of acute administration of THC or marijuana report increased resting activity and activation of the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex during cognitive tasks. Only three of the structural imaging studies found differences between users and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Functional neuroimaging studies suggest a modulation of global and prefrontal metabolism both during the resting state and after the administration of THC/marijuana cigarettes. Minimal evidence of major effects of cannabis on brain structure has been reported.",

    abstract = "We describe here a new way of obtaining maps of connectivity in the human brain based on interregional correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during natural viewing conditions. We propose that anatomical connections are reflected in BOLD signal correlations during natural brain dynamics. This may provide a powerful approach to chart connectivity, more so than that based on the 'resting state' of the human brain, and it may complement diffusion tensor imaging. Our approach relies on natural brain dynamics and is therefore experimentally unbiased and independent of hypothesis-driven, specialized stimuli. It has the advantage that natural viewing leads to considerably stronger cortical activity than rest, thus facilitating detection of weaker connections. To validate our technique, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record BOLD signal while volunteers freely viewed a movie that was interrupted by resting periods. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to segregate cortical areas before characterizing the dynamics of their BOLD signal during free viewing and rest. Natural viewing and rest each revealed highly specific correlation maps, which reflected known anatomical connections. Examples are homologous regions in visual and auditory cortices in the two hemispheres and the language network consisting of Wernicke's area, Broca's area, and a premotor region. Correlations between regions known to be directly connected were always substantially higher than between nonconnected regions. Furthermore, compared to rest, natural viewing specifically increased correlations between anatomically connected regions while it decreased correlations between nonconnected regions. Our findings therefore demonstrate that natural viewing conditions lead to particularly specific interregional correlations and thus provide a powerful environment to reveal anatomical connectivity in vivo.",

    title = "{Reward circuit connectivity relates to delay discounting in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.}",
    abstract = "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder that has poor long-term outcomes and remains a major public health concern. Recent theories have proposed that ADHD arises from alterations in multiple neural pathways. Alterations in reward circuits are hypothesized as one core dysfunction, leading to altered processing of anticipated rewards. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is particularly important for reward processes; task-based fMRI studies have found atypical activation of this region while the participants performed a reward task. Understanding how reward circuits are involved with ADHD may be further enhanced by considering how the NAcc interacts with other brain regions. Here we used the technique of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to examine the alterations in the NAcc interactions and how they relate to impulsive decision making in ADHD. Using rs-fcMRI, this study: examined differences in functional connectivity of the NAcc between children with ADHD and control children; correlated the functional connectivity of NAcc with impulsivity, as measured by a delay discounting task; and combined these two initial segments to identify the atypical NAcc connections that were associated with impulsive decision making in ADHD. We found that functional connectivity of NAcc was atypical in children with ADHD and the ADHD-related increased connectivity between NAcc and the prefrontal cortex was associated with greater impulsivity (steeper delayed-reward discounting). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that atypical signaling of the NAcc to the prefrontal cortex in ADHD may lead to excessive approach and failure in estimating future consequences; thus, leading to impulsive behavior",

METHODS: DMN connectivity was established using independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI data in patients with reversible (n = 2) and irreversible (n = 11) coma following cardiac arrest and compared to healthy controls (n = 12). RESULTS: A present and intact DMN was observed in controls and those patients who subsequently regained consciousness, but was disrupted in all patients who failed to regain consciousness. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the DMN is necessary but not sufficient to support consciousness. Clinically, DMN connectivity may serve as an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness",

    abstract = {Spontaneous hemodynamic signals fluctuate coherently within many resting-brain functional networks not only in awake humans and lightly anesthetized primates but also in animals under deep anesthesia characterized by burst-suppression electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and unconsciousness. To understand the neural origin of spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations under such a deep anesthesia state, epidural EEG and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were simultaneously recorded from the bilateral somatosensory cortical regions of rats with isoflurane-induced burst-suppression EEG activity. Strong neurovascular coupling was observed between spontaneous EEG "bursts" and CBF "bumps," both of which were also highly synchronized across the 2 hemispheres. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to image spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals under the same anesthesia conditions and showed similar BOLD "bumps" and dependence on anesthesia depth as the CBF signals. The spatiotemporal BOLD correlations indicate a strong but less-specific coherent network covering a wide range of cortical regions. The overall findings reveal that the spontaneous CBF/BOLD fluctuations under unconscious burst-suppression anesthesia conditions originate mainly from underlying neural activity. They provide insights into the neurophysiological basis for the use of BOLD- and CBF-based fMRI signals for noninvasively imaging spontaneous and synchronous brain activity under various brain states.},

    abstract = {Previous work has shown that temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), part of a ventral attention network for stimulus-driven reorienting, deactivates during effortful cognitive engagement, along with the default mode network (DMN). TPJ deactivation has been reported both during working memory (WM) and rapid visual search, ostensibly to prevent reorienting to irrelevant objects. We tested whether the magnitude of this deactivation during WM encoding is predictive of subsequent WM performance. Using slow event-related fMRI and a delayed WM task in which distracter stimuli were presented during the maintenance phase, we found that greater TPJ and DMN deactivation during the encoding phase predicted better WM performance. TPJ and DMN, however, also showed several functional dissociations: (1) TPJ exhibited a different task-evoked pattern than DMN, responding to distracters sharing task-relevant features, but not to other types of distracters; and (2) TPJ showed strong functional connectivity with the DMN at encoding but not during distracter presentation. These results provide further evidence for the functional importance of TPJ suppression and indicate that TPJ and DMN deactivation is especially critical during WM trace formation. In addition, the functional connectivity results suggest that TPJ, while not part of the DMN during the resting state, may flexibly "couple" with this network depending on task demands.},

We measured the influence of spatial resolution at 7T on estimates of functional connectivity through decreased partial volume averaging. Ten subjects were imaged at 7T with a range of spatial resolutions (1×1×2mm to 3×3×2mm) during performance of a finger tapping task and in the resting state. We found that resting state correlations within the sensory-motor system increase as voxel dimensions decreased from 3×3×2mm to 1×1×2mm, whereas connectivity to other brain regions was unaffected. This improvement occurred even as overall signal to noise ratios decrease. Our data suggest that this increase may be due to decreased partial volume averaging, and that functional connectivity within the primary seed region is heterogeneous on the scale of single voxels",

Furthermore, we investigate the contribution of motion and hardware instabilities to resting-state correlations and provide a method to reduce artifacts. For all cortical regions studied and clusters obtained, we quantify the degree of contamination of functional connectivity maps by the respiratory and cardiac cycle.

This paper presents a statistical approach to identify connections in such a graph that may be associated with a diagnostic status in case-control studies, changing psychological contexts in task-based studies, or correlations with various cognitive and behavioral measures. The new approach, called the network-based statistic (NBS), is a method to control the family-wise error rate (in the weak sense) when mass-univariate testing is performed at every connection comprising the graph. To potentially offer a substantial gain in power, the NBS exploits the extent to which the connections comprising the contrast or effect of interest are interconnected. The NBS is based on the principles underpinning traditional cluster-based thresholding of statistical parametric maps. The purpose of this paper is to: (i) introduce the NBS for the first time; (ii) evaluate its power with the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves; and, (iii) demonstrate its utility with application to a real case-control study involving a group of people with schizophrenia for which resting-state functional MRI data were acquired. The NBS identified a expansive dysconnected subnetwork in the group with schizophrenia, primarily comprising fronto-temporal and occipito-temporal dysconnections, whereas a mass-univariate analysis controlled with the false discovery rate failed to identify a subnetwork.",

    abstract = "There is a well-established association between APOE genotype and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Relative to individuals with the common $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$3 genotype, carriers of the $\epsilon$4 allele are at increased risk of developing AD, while carriers of the $\epsilon$2 allele appear to be protected against the disease. However, we recently reported that in a sample of cognitively healthy adults, both $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 carriers showed nearly identical changes in the pattern of fMRI activity during memory and non-memory tasks, relative to $\epsilon$3 homozygotes. These findings suggest that the effects of APOE on brain function are not tightly linked to the effects of this gene on AD risk. Here we test the hypothesis that APOE has an intrinsic effect on the brain's functional networks. Resting-state fMRI was used to compare the pattern of functional connectivity of a variety of resting-state networks between 77 cognitively healthy participants aged 32 to 55 with different APOE genotypes (23 $\epsilon$2/$\epsilon$3, 20 $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$3, 26 $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$4, and 8 $\epsilon$4/$\epsilon$4). Differences between genotype groups were found in two hippocampal networks, the auditory network, the left frontal-parietal network, and the lateral visual network. While there was considerable variety in the brain regions affected and the direction of change across networks, the main finding was that changes in functional connectivity were similar in $\epsilon$4 and $\epsilon$2 carriers, relative to $\epsilon$3 homozygotes. APOE appears to have an intrinsic effect on the differentiation of functional networks in the brain. This effect is apparent in cognitively healthy adults and does not manifest in a manner reflective of the link between APOE and AD risk. Rather, the effects of APOE on brain function may relate to the role of this gene in neurodevelopment.",

Accumulating data indicate that ASD is associated with alterations of neural circuitry. Functional MRI (FMRI) studies have focused on connectivity in the context of psychological tasks. However, even in the absence of a task, the brain exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic or resting connectivity. Notably, the default network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex, retro-splenial, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus, is strongly active when there is no task. Altered intrinsic connectivity within the default network may underlie offline processing that may actuate ASD impairments. Using FMRI, we sought to evaluate intrinsic connectivity within the default network in ASD. Relative to controls, the ASD group showed weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus and stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and both the right temporal lobe and right parahippocampal gyrus. Moreover, poorer social functioning in the ASD group was correlated with weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus. In addition, more severe restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD were correlated with stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right parahippocampal gyrus. These findings indicate that ASD subjects show altered intrinsic connectivity within the default network, and connectivity between these structures is associated with specific ASD symptoms",

Here we aim to explore brain disturbances underlying extraversion and neuroticism in 87 healthy individuals using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Two different frequency bands, Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) exhibiting higher power and involving larger brain regions, and Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) exhibiting less power and emerging locally, were analyzed. Our results showed a positive correlation between LFF amplitude at Slow-5 and extraversion in medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, important portions of the default mode network, thus suggesting a link between default network activity and personality traits. LFF amplitude at Slow-5 was correlated positively with neuroticism in right posterior portion of the frontal lobe, further validating neuroticism with frontal lateralization. In addition, LFF amplitude at Slow-4 was negatively associated with extraversion and neuroticism in left hippocampus (HIP) and bilateral superior temporal cortex (STC) respectively, supporting the hypothesized (inverse) relationship between extraversion and resting arousal, also implying neural circuit underlying emotional process influencing on personality.

We applied resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theoretical analysis to examine the connectome in breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy relative to healthy comparison women. Compared to healthy females, the breast cancer group displayed altered global brain network organization characterized by significantly decreased global clustering as well as disrupted regional network characteristics in frontal, striatal and temporal areas. Breast cancer survivors also showed significantly increased self-report of executive function and memory difficulties compared to healthy females. These results suggest that topological organization of both global and regional brain network properties may be disrupted following breast cancer and chemotherapy. This pattern of altered network organization is believed to result in reduced efficiency of parallel information transfer. This is the first report of alterations in large-scale functional brain networks in this population and contributes novel information regarding the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying breast cancer-related cognitive impairment",

Here, we propose a method to identify these large-scale networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Regions belonging to such networks are defined as sets of strongly interacting regions, each of which showing a homogeneous temporal activity. Our method of large-scale network identification (LSNI) proceeds by first detecting functionally homogeneous regions. The networks of functional interconnections are then found by comparing the correlations among these regions against a model of the correlations in the noise. To test the LSNI method, we first evaluated its specificity and sensitivity on synthetic data sets. Then, the method was applied to four real data sets with a block-designed motor task. The LSNI method correctly recovered the regions whose temporal activity was locked to the stimulus. In addition, it detected two other main networks highly reproducible across subjects, whose activity was dominated by slow fluctuations (0-0.1 Hz). One was located in medial and dorsal regions, and mostly overlapped the "default" network of the brain at rest [Greicius, M.D., Krasnow, B., Reiss, A.L., Menon, V., 2003.

    abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Degraded social function, disinhibition, and stereotypy are defining characteristics of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), manifesting in both the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD) subtypes. Recent neuroimaging research also associates FTD with alterations in the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks. The present study explored the relationship between neural network connectivity and specific behavioral symptoms in FTD. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to investigate neural network changes in bvFTD and SD. We used independent components analysis (ICA) to examine changes in frontolimbic network connectivity, as well as several metrics of local network strength, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and seed-based functional connectivity. For each analysis, we compared each FTD subgroup to healthy controls, characterizing general and subtype-unique network changes. The relationship between abnormal connectivity in FTD and behavior disturbances was explored. RESULTS: Across multiple analytic approaches, both bvFTD and SD were associated with disrupted frontolimbic connectivity and elevated local connectivity within the prefrontal cortex. Even after controlling for structural atrophy, prefrontal hyperconnectivity was robustly associated with apathy scores. Frontolimbic disconnection was associated with lower disinhibition scores, suggesting that abnormal frontolimbic connectivity contributes to positive symptoms in dementia. Unique to bvFTD, stereotypy was associated with elevated default network connectivity in the right angular gyrus. The behavioral variant was also associated with marginally higher apathy scores and a more diffuse pattern of prefrontal hyperconnectivity than SD. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support a theory of FTD as a disorder of frontolimbic disconnection leading to unconstrained prefrontal connectivity. Prefrontal hyperconnectivity may represent a compensatory response to the absence of affective feedback during the planning and execution of behavior. Increased reliance upon prefrontal processes in isolation from subcortical structures appears to be maladaptive and may drive behavioral withdrawal that is commonly observed in later phases of neurodegeneration",

    abstract = "OBJECT: The objective of this work was to assess functional connectivity measurements at ultra-high field (7T), given BOLD contrast to noise ratio increases with magnetic field strength but physiological noise also increases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting state BOLD data were acquired at 3 and 7T to assess connectivity in the sensorimotor network (SMN) and default mode network (DMN) at different spatial smoothing levels. RESULTS: At 3 and 7T positive correlation is observed between a right sensorimotor seed and left sensorimotor cortex. For the DMN, a seed in posterior cingulate cortex results in a high correlation in inferior parietal lobes and medial prefrontal cortex. We show higher temporal correlation coefficients for both the SMN and DMN at 7T compared to 3T for all smoothing levels. A spatial correlation between connectivity maps revealed no significant differences for the SMN, whilst the DMN showed increased spatial correlation dependent on SNR. The maximum physiological noise contribution was found to be higher at 7T, but noise in both seed and network nodes was not significantly increased, as shown by no significant difference in the spatial correlation of maps following physiological correction. CONCLUSION: 7T can improve spatial specificity of connectivity maps and facilitate measurement of connectivity in areas of lower intrinsic network correlation.",

    abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the amnestic subtype of MCI in particular, is the most recent concept used to describe the intermediary state between healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is hoped that research focusing on MCI would yield markers for early identification of individuals with prodromal AD at such a pre-dementia stage when potential disease modifying therapies would be most efficacious. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with various data analysis methods provides tools to investigate alterations in brain structure and function in vivo. Structurally, MCI is characterized by atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and the amount of atrophy in MCI is intermediate between healthy aging and AD. Additionally, atrophy of the posteromedial cortices such as the posterior cingulum and precuneus as well as of the lateral temporal cortices has been reported. The pattern of atrophy appears to vary according to the subtype of MCI. Functional MRI studies in MCI, compared to healthy aging and AD, have demonstrated both increased and decreased MTL activity during encoding novel visually presented material. Differences in the MTL activation pattern in MCI subjects may relate to differences in the severity of cognitive decline. There is some evidence that increased MTL activity observed during encoding may be compensatory due to incipient atrophy in the MTL structures. The resting state (or, "default mode") network, and the posteromedial cortical regions in particular, appear to malfunction in MCI. It is suggested that both altered MTL and posteromedial cortical function may be indicative of future cognitive decline from MCI to clinical AD.},

    abstract = "Recently, much scientific attention has been focused on resting brain activity and its investigation through such methods as the analysis of functional connectivity during rest (the temporal correlation of brain activities in different regions). However, investigation of the magnitude of brain activity during rest has focused on the relative decrease of brain activity during a task, rather than on the absolute resting brain activity. It is thus necessary to investigate the association between cognitive factors and measures of absolute resting brain activity, such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), during rest (rest-CBF). In this study, we examined this association using multiple regression analyses. Rest-CBF was the dependent variable and the independent variables included two essential components of cognitive functions, psychometric general intelligence and creativity. CBF was measured using arterial spin labeling and there were three analyses for rest-CBF; namely mean gray matter rest-CBF, mean white matter rest-CBF, and regional rest-CBF. The results showed that mean gray and white matter rest-CBF were significantly and positively correlated with individual psychometric intelligence. Furthermore, mean white matter rest-CBF was significantly and positively correlated with creativity. After correcting the effect of mean gray matter rest-CBF the significant and positive correlation between regional rest-CBF in the perisylvian anatomical cluster that includes the left superior temporal gyrus and insula and individual psychometric intelligence was found. Also, regional rest-CBF in the precuneus was significantly and negatively correlated with individual creativity. Significance of these results of regional rest-CBF did not change when the effect of regional gray matter density was corrected. The findings showed mean and regional rest-CBF in healthy young subjects to be correlated with cognitive functions. The findings also suggest that, even in young cognitively intact subjects, resting brain activity (possibly underlain by default cognitive activity or metabolic demand from developed brain structures) is associated with cognitive functions",

The current dominant view is that such networks are associated with slow (∼0.015Hz), spontaneous fluctuations in the BOLD signal. To date, limited work has investigated the frequency characteristics of RSNs; here we investigate a range of issues relating to their spectral and phase characteristics. Our results indicate that RSNs, although dominated by low frequencies in the raw BOLD signal, are in fact broadband processes that show temporal coherences across a wide frequency spectrum. In addition, we show that RSNs exhibit different levels of phase synchrony at different frequencies. These findings challenge the notion that FMRI resting signals are simple "low frequency" spontaneous signal fluctuations.},

    abstract = "Suicidality is a major challenge for today's health care. Evidence suggests that there are differences in cognitive functioning of suicidal patients but the knowledge about the underlying neurobiology is limited. Brain imaging offers the advantage of a non-invasive in vivo direct estimation of detailed brain structure, regional brain functioning and estimation of molecular processes in the brain. We have reviewed the literature on neuroimaging studies of the suicidal brain. This article contains studies on structural imaging such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional imaging, consisting of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) and functional MRI (fMRI). We classified the results of the different imaging modalities in structural and functional imaging. Within our research, we found no significant differences in the suicidal brain demonstrated by Computed Tomography. Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in subjects with a history of suicide attempt on the other hand deliver differing results, mostly pointing at a higher prevalence of white (especially deep white matter and periventricular) and grey matter hyperintensities in the frontal, temporal and/or parietal lobe and decreased volumes in the frontal and temporal lobe. There seems to be a trend towards findings of reduced grey matter volume in the frontal lobe. Overall, there is no consensus of opinion on structural imaging of the suicidal brain. Research on functional imaging is further divided into studies in resting state, studies in activation conditions and studies on brain neurotransmitters, transporters and receptors. A common finding in functional neuroimaging in resting conditions is a decreased perfusion in the prefrontal cortex of suicidal patients. During cognitive activation, perfusion deficits in the prefrontal cortex have been observed. After fenfluramine challenge, the prefrontal cortex metabolism seems to be inversely correlated to the lethality of previous suicide attempt. The few studies that examined the serotonin transporter in suicide found no significant differences in binding potential. In suicide attempters there seems to be a negative correlation between impulsivity and SERT binding. Our group found a reduced 5-HT(2A) binding in the frontal cortex in patients with a recent suicide attempt. The binding index was significantly lower in the deliberate self injury patients compared to the deliberate self poisoning patients. The few authors that examined DAT binding in suicide found no significant DAT differences between patients and controls. However they demonstrated significant negative correlations between DAT binding potential and mental energy among suicide attempters, but not in healthy control subjects. We did not find studies measuring the binding potential of the noradrenalin or gamma amino butyric acid transporter or receptor in suicidal subjects. Several reports have suggested abnormalities of GABA neurotransmission in depression. During our literature search, we have focused on neuroimaging studies in suicidal populations, but in the absence of evidence in the literature on this group or when further collateral evidence is appropriate, this overview expands to results in impulsive aggressive or in depressed subjects.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gender effects are strong in multiple sclerosis (MS), with male patients showing a worse clinical outcome than female patients. Functional reorganization of neural activity may contribute to limit disability, and possible gender differences in this process may have important clinical implications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore gender-related changes in functional connectivity and network efficiency in MS patients. Additionally, we explored the association of functional changes with cognitive function. METHODS: Sixty subjects were included in the study, matched for age, education level and intelligence quotient (IQ). Male and female patients were matched for disability, disease duration and white matter lesion load. Two cognitive domains often impaired in MS, i.e. visuospatial memory and information processing speed, were evaluated in all subjects. Functional connectivity between brain regions and network efficiency was explored using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph analysis. Differences in cognitive and functional characteristics between groups, and correlations with cognitive performance, were examined. RESULTS: Male patients showed worse performance on cognitive tests than female and male controls, while female patients were cognitively normal. Decreases in functional connectivity and network efficiency, observed in male patients, correlated with reduced visuospatial memory (r = -0.6 and r = -0.5, respectively). In the control group, no cognitive differences were found between genders, despite differences in functional connectivity between healthy men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Functional connectivity differences were found in male patients only and were related to impaired visuospatial memory. These results underline the importance of gender in MS and require further investigation in larger and longitudinal studies",

Data were analyzed using group spatial Independent Component Analysis using concatenation approach (FSL 4.1.3) and double regression analyses (SPM5) to extract local and global levels of connectivity inside various resting state networks (RSNs). Differences in global levels of connectivity of each network between patients and controls were assessed using Mann-Whitney U-test. In patients, relationship between clinical data (Expanded Disability Status Scale and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite Score - MSFC) and global RSN connectivity were assessed using Spearman rank correlation.Results: Independent component analysis provided eight consistent neuronal networks involved in motor, sensory and cognitive processes. For seven RSNs, the global level of connectivity was significantly increased in patients compared with controls. No significant decrease in RSN connectivity was found in early multiple sclerosis patients. MSFC values were negatively correlated with increased RSN connectivity within the dorsal frontoparietal network (r = -0.811, p = 0.001), the right ventral frontoparietal network (r = -0.587, p = 0.045) and the prefronto-insular network (r = -0.615, p = 0.033).Conclusions: This study demonstrates that resting state networks reorganization is strongly associated with disability in early multiple sclerosis.

    abstract = "The main reason for recreational use of cannabis is the 'high', the primary psychotropic effect of $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). This psychoactive compound of cannabis induces a range of subjective, physical and mental reactions. The effect on heart rate is pronounced and complicates bloodflow-based neuroimaging of psychotropic effects of THC. In this study we investigated the effects of THC on baseline brain perfusion and activity in association with the induction of 'feeling high'. Twenty-three subjects participated in a pharmacological MRI study, where we applied arterial spin labelling (ASL) to measure perfusion, and resting-state functional MRI to assess blood oxygen level-dependent signal fluctuation as a measure of baseline brain activity. Feeling high was assessed with a visual analogue scale and was compared to the imaging measures. THC increased perfusion in the anterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal cortex, and insula, and reduced perfusion in the post-central and occipital gyrus. Baseline brain activity was altered, indicated by increased amplitude of fluctuations in resting-state functional MRI signal after THC administration in the insula, substantia nigra and cerebellum. Perfusion changes in frontal cortex were negatively correlated with ratings of feeling high, suggesting an interaction between cognitive control and subjective effects of THC. In conclusion, an acute THC challenge altered baseline brain perfusion and activity, especially in frontal brain areas involved in cognitive and emotional processes, and the insula, associated with interoceptive awareness. These changes may represent the THC-induced neurophysiological correlates of feeling high. The alterations in baseline brain perfusion and activity also have relevance for studies on task-related effects of THC on brain function",

In particular, the existing evidence is too inconsistent to allow formulation of specific hypotheses linking DMN activity to traditional EEG frequency bands. In this study, we aimed to test whether blind decomposition methods are able to identify in EEG data spatial patterns resembling the DMN as it is described in PET and fMRI studies. Further we aimed to test a degree of task-relatedness of DMN patterns identified in the traditional EEG frequency bands. To answer these questions we collected data both in a resting state and during performance of two experimental tasks: an explicit judgment of facial affect and a social game task. Individual differences in amount of self-referential thoughts during the resting state were measured by a short self-report scale. Only alpha band spatial patterns simultaneously showed a considerable overlap with the DMN and high correlations with presumptive DMN function-related outcomes both in the resting state and during the social game task. Spontaneous self-referential thoughts were associated with enhanced alpha activity in the posterior DMN hub, whereas processing of DMN function-related external stimuli disrupted this activity and simultaneously caused partial alpha phase-locking to external events. This evidence implies that synchronization of internal mental processes, as opposed to the processing of external stimuli, might be the primary function of alpha oscillations which is bound to be related to activity of the DMN.",

FMRIs were acquired in 22 PD patients before and after levodopa administration, and in age- and sex-matched normal controls. The total connectivity degree of each region within the motor network was calculated and compared between patients and controls. We found that PD patients at off state had significantly decreased functional connectivity in the supplementary motor area, left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and left putamen, and had increased functional connectivity in the left cerebellum, left primary motor cortex, and left parietal cortex compared to normal subjects. Administration of levodopa relatively normalized the pattern of functional connectivity in PD patients. The functional connectivity in most of regions in the motor network correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score in the patients. Our findings demonstrate that the pattern of functional connectivity of the motor network in the resting state is disrupted in PD. This change is secondary to dopamine deficiency, and related to the severity of the disease. We postulate that this abnormal functional connectivity of motor network in the baseline state is possibly an important factor contributing to some motor deficits in PD, e.g. akinesia",

The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rs1143627 polymorphism of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) gene moderates functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-measured brain regional activity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Eighty older participants (47 with aMCI and 33 healthy controls) were recruited for this study. All of the participants were genotyped for variant rs1143627 in the IL1B gene and were scanned using resting-state fMRI. Brain activity was assessed by amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). RESULTS: aMCI patients had abnormal ALFF in many brain regions, including decreases in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal lobe and the middle temporal lobe, and increases in the occipital cortex (calcarine), parietal cortex (Pcu) and cerebellar cortex. The regions associated with an interaction of group X genotypes of rs1143627 C/T were the parietal cortex (left Pcu), frontal cortex (left superior, middle, and medial gyrus, right anterior cingulum), occipital cortex (left middle lobe, left cuneus) and the bilateral posterior lobes of the cerebellum. Regarding the behavioral significance, there were significant correlations between ALFF in different regions of the brain and with the cognitive scores of each genotype group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided evidence that aMCI patients had abnormal ALFF in many brain regions. Specifically, the rs1143627 C/T polymorphism of the IL1B gene may modulate regional spontaneous brain activity in aMCI patients",

Although many imaging studies have examined task activation during motor performance, none have examined the relationship between functional intrinsic connectivity and motor ability. The current study investigated the relationship between resting state functional connectivity within the motor network and motor performance assessment outside of the scanner in 40 typically developing right-handed children. Better motor performance correlated with greater left-lateralized (mean left hemisphere-mean right hemisphere) motor circuit connectivity. Speed, rhythmicity, and control of movements were associated with connectivity within different individual region pairs: faster speed was associated with more left-lateralized putamen-thalamus connectivity, less overflow with more left-lateralized supplementary motor-primary motor connectivity, and less dysrhythmia with more left-lateralized supplementary motor-anterior cerebellar connectivity. These findings suggest that for right-handed children, superior motor development depends on the establishment of left-hemisphere dominance in intrinsic motor network connectivity",

    title = "{Altered effective connectivity network of the amygdala in social anxiety disorder: a resting-state FMRI study.}",
    abstract = {The amygdala is often found to be abnormally recruited in social anxiety disorder (SAD) patients. The question whether amygdala activation is primarily abnormal and affects other brain systems or whether it responds "normally" to an abnormal pattern of information conveyed by other brain structures remained unanswered. To address this question, we investigated a network of effective connectivity associated with the amygdala using Granger causality analysis on resting-state functional MRI data of 22 SAD patients and 21 healthy controls (HC). Implications of abnormal effective connectivity and clinical severity were investigated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Decreased influence from inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to amygdala was found in SAD, while bidirectional influences between amygdala and visual cortices were increased compared to HCs. Clinical relevance of decreased effective connectivity from ITG to amygdala was suggested by a negative correlation of LSAS avoidance scores and the value of Granger causality. Our study is the first to reveal a network of abnormal effective connectivity of core structures in SAD. This is in support of a disregulation in predescribed modules involved in affect control. The amygdala is placed in a central position of dysfunction characterized both by decreased regulatory influence of orbitofrontal cortex and increased crosstalk with visual cortex. The model which is proposed based on our results lends neurobiological support towards cognitive models considering disinhibition and an attentional bias towards negative stimuli as a core feature of the disorder.},

    abstract = "To date, little data is available on the reproducibility of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) studies. Here, we tested the variability and reproducibility of both the functional connectivity itself and different statistical methods to analyze this phenomenon. In the main part of our study, we repeatedly examined two healthy subjects in 10 sessions over 6 months with fcMRI. Cortical areas involved in motor function were examined under two different cognitive states: during continuous performance (CP) of a flexion/extension task of the fingers of the right hand and while subjects were at rest. Connectivity to left primary motor cortex (lSM1) was calculated by correlation analysis. The resulting correlation coefficients were transformed to z-scores of the standard normal distribution. For each subject, multisession statistical analyses were carried out with the z-score maps of the resting state (RS) and the CP experiments. First, voxel based t tests between the two groups of fcMRI experiments were performed. Second, ROI analyses were carried out for contralateral right SM1 and for supplementary motor area (SMA). For both ROI, mean and maximum z-score were calculated for each experiment. Also, the fraction of significantly (P<.05) correlated voxels (FCV) in each ROI was calculated. To evaluate the differences between the RS and the CP condition, paired t tests were performed for the mean and maximum z-scores, and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests for matched pairs were carried out for the FCV. All statistical methods and connectivity measures under investigation yielded a distinct loss in left-right SM1 connectivity under the CP condition. For SMA, interindividual differences were apparent. We therefore repeated the fcMRI experiments and the ROI analyses in a group of seven healthy subjects (including the two subjects of the main study). In this substudy, we were able to verify the reduction of left-right SM1 connectivity during unilateral performance. Still, the direction of SMA to lSM1 connectivity change during the CP condition remained undefined as four subjects showed a connectivity increase and three showed a decrease. In summary, we were able to demonstrate a distinct reduction in left-right SM1 synchrony in the CP condition compared to the RS both in the longitudinal and in the multisubject study. This effect was reproducible with all statistical methods and all measures of connectivity under investigation. We conclude that despite intra- and interindividual variability, serial and cross-sectional assessment of functional connectivity reveals stable and reliable results.",

    abstract = "Compelling evidence suggests that there is a considerable overlap in structural and functional alternation in the brain between different neuropsychiatric disorders. However, whether these overlaps are specific for schizophrenia has yet to be investigated. A total of 36 patients with paranoid schizophrenia, 43 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 44 healthy controls were recruited to undergo resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo). Twelve regions of interest (ROIs) in the frontal and temporal lobes were generated and one-way ANOVA was performed to test the ReHo differences within these ROIs between the above three groups. The ReHo values within ROIs were extracted to investigate whether a left-right asymmetry existed in a mental disorder. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences in ReHo in the right superior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus; post hoc analysis revealed that schizophrenic patients had lower ReHo in the left superior temporal gyrus than either control subjects or patients with MDD. Increased ReHo was observed in the right superior frontal gyrus in schizophrenic patients compared with control subjects, and a left-less-than-right asymmetry was also found in this region in schizophrenic patients. The above alterations in ReHo were not affected by age and genders. Our study suggests that the altered ReHo in the superior frontal and temporal gyrus may be specific for schizophrenia rather than MDD. A left-less-than-right asymmetry activation pattern may exist in the resting-state superior frontal gyrus in schizophrenia. This finding would be helpful for better understanding the pathological mechanisms of schizophrenia. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

However, there is an increasing need for a new method that is more sensitive to early AD identification than currently possible. A new promising technique that may be used for this is to measure local brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), since functional loss predates structural loss of brain tissue. A new method to apply fMRI is to study connectivity between brain regions during a resting state without application of a task. Recent data suggest that connectivity within memory systems during such a resting state is associated with the level of memory function. Here we explain how we will study healthy elderly controls, patients with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI, considered to be a transitional stage between normal condition and AD), and AD patients using resting state connectivity fMRI. If resting state connectivity is sensitive to cognitive decline, this will be of great importance for noninvasive dementia research, offering a tool to easily study functional networks in the brain without the requirement of a memory task, and perhaps offering a tool sensitive for early diagnostics.",

The present study aimed to investigate how the resting state brain activities in healthy subjects were modulated by relatively long-period (30min) acupuncture, a widely used modality in clinical practice. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) or intermittent minimal TEAS (MTEAS) were given for 30min to 40 subjects. Functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected including the pre-stimulation resting state and the post-stimulation resting state, using dual-echo arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques, representing both cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals and blood oxygen-dependent level (BOLD) signals simultaneously. Following 30min TEAS, but not MTEAS, the mean global CBF decreased, and a significant decrease of regional CBF was observed in SI, insula, STG, MOG and IFG. Functional connectivity analysis showed more secure and spatially extended connectivity of both the DMN and SMN after 30min TEAS. Our results implied that modulation of the regional brain activities and network connectivity induced by thirty minute TEAS may associate with the acupuncture-related therapeutic effects. Furthermore, the resting state regional CBF quantified by ASL perfusion fMRI may serve as a potential biomarker in future acupuncture studies",

    abstract = "We hypothesize that the evolution of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may be related to differential effects of a concussive blow on the functional integrity of the brain default mode network (DMN) at rest and/or in response to physical stress. Accordingly, in this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined 14 subjects 10±2 days post-sports-related mTBI and 15 age-matched normal volunteers (NVs) to investigate the possibility that the integrity of the DMN is disrupted at the resting state and/or following the physical stress test. First, all mTBI subjects were asymptomatic based upon clinical evaluation and neuropsychological (NP) assessments prior to the MRI session. Second, the functional integrity within the DMN, a main resting-state network, remained resilient to a single concussive blow. Specifically, the major regions of interest (ROIs) constituting the DMN (e.g., the posterior cingulate cortex [PCC]/precuneus area, the medial prefrontal cortex [MPFC], and left and right lateral parietal cortices [LLP and RLP]) and the connectivity within these four ROIs was similar between NVs and mTBI subjects prior to the YMCA physical stress test. However, the YMCA physical stress test disrupted the DMN, significantly reducing the magnitude of the connection between the PCC and left lateral parietal ROI, and PCC and right lateral parietal ROI, as well as between the PCC and MPFC in mTBI subjects. Thus while the DMN remained resilient to a single mTBI without exertion at 10 days post-injury, it was altered in response to limited physical stress. This may explain some clinical features of mTBI and provide some insight into its mechanism. This important finding should be considered by clinical practitioners when making decisions regarding return-to-play and clearing mTBI athletes for sports participation",

Whereas the former are by definition insensitive to nonlinear effects, the latter detect both nonlinear and linear interrelation. In the present contribution we employ a uniform surrogate-based approach, which is capable of disentangling interrelations that significantly exceed random effects and interrelations that significantly exceed linear correlation. The bivariate version of the proposed framework is explored using a simple model allowing for separate tuning of coupling and nonlinearity of interrelation. To demonstrate applicability of the approach to multivariate real-world time series we investigate resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data of two healthy subjects as well as intracranial electroencephalograms (iEEG) of two epilepsy patients with focal onset seizures. The main findings are that for our rsfMRI data interrelations can be described by linear cross-correlation. Rejection of the null hypothesis of linear iEEG interrelation occurs predominantly for epileptogenic tissue as well as during epileptic seizures.",

The coupling of local neuronal processes influences coherence in a voxel's neighborhood. ILC is defined, for each voxel, as the integration of its spatial correlation function. This integrated measure does not require the specification of a neighborhood and, as demonstrated by experimental data, is effectively independent of image resolution. Respiratory and cardiac fluctuations do not considerably alter the ILC value except in isolated areas in and surrounding large vessels. With resting-state fMRI data, ILC was demonstrated to be tissue-specific, higher in gray matter than white matter, and reproducible across consecutive runs in healthy individuals. Within the gray matter, ILC was found to be higher in the default mode network, particularly the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices. Comparing ILC maps obtained from resting state and continuous motor task data, we observed reduced local coherence in the default mode network during the task. Finally, we compared ILC and regional homogeneity by examining their ability to discriminate between gray and white matters in resting state data and found ILC to be more sensitive",

We demonstrated the CBF connectivity matrices follow 'small-world' attributes similar to previous studies using different modalities of neuroimaging data (MRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG). The highest concurrent fluctuations in CBF were detected between homologous cortical regions (homologous callosal connections). It was found that the existence of structural core regions or hubs positioned on a high proportion of shortest paths within the CBF network. These were anatomically distributed in frontal, limbic, occipital and parietal regions that suggest its important role in functional integration.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND:In the absence of overt stimuli, the brain shows correlated fluctuations in functionally related brain regions. Approximately ten largely independent resting state networks (RSNs) showing this behaviour have been documented to date. Recent studies have reported the existence of an RSN in the basal ganglia - albeit inconsistently and without the means to interpret its function. Using two large study groups with different resting state conditions and MR protocols, the reproducibility of the network across subjects, behavioural conditions and acquisition parameters is assessed. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), combined with novel analyses of temporal features, is applied to establish the basis of signal fluctuations in the network and its relation to other RSNs. Reference to prior probabilistic diffusion tractography work is used to identify the basal ganglia circuit to which these fluctuations correspond.RESULTS:An RSN is identified in the basal ganglia and thalamus, comprising the pallidum, putamen, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra, with a projection also to the supplementary motor area. Participating nuclei and thalamo-cortical connection probabilities allow this network to be identified as the motor control circuit of the basal ganglia. The network was reproducibly identified across subjects, behavioural conditions (fixation, eyes closed), field strength and echo-planar imaging parameters. It shows a frequency peak at 0.025 +/- 0.007 Hz and is most similar in spectral composition to the Default Mode (DM), a network of regions that is more active at rest than during task processing. Frequency features allow the network to be classified as an RSN rather than a physiological artefact. Fluctuations in this RSN are correlated with those in the task-positive fronto-parietal network and anticorrelated with those in the DM, whose hemodynamic response it anticipates.CONCLUSION:Although the basal ganglia RSN has not been reported in most ICA-based studies using a similar methodology, we demonstrate that it is reproducible across subjects, common resting state conditions and imaging parameters, and show that it corresponds with the motor control circuit. This characterisation of the basal ganglia network opens a potential means to investigate the motor-related neuropathologies in which the basal ganglia are involved.",

    abstract = "Although resting-state brain activity has been demonstrated to correspond with task-evoked brain activation, the relationship between intrinsic and evoked brain activity has not been fully characterized. For example, it is unclear whether intrinsic activity can also predict task-evoked deactivation and whether the rest-task relationship is dependent on task load. In this study, we addressed these issues on 40 healthy control subjects using resting-state and task-driven [N-back working memory (WM) task] functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in the same session. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index of intrinsic resting-state activity, we found that ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior/superior parietal lobules was positively correlated with WM task-evoked activation, while ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was negatively correlated with WM task-evoked deactivation. Further, the relationship between the intrinsic resting-state activity and task-evoked activation in lateral/superior frontal gyri, inferior/superior parietal lobules, superior temporal gyrus, and midline regions was stronger at higher WM task loads. In addition, both resting-state activity and the task-evoked activation in the superior parietal lobule/precuneus were significantly correlated with the WM task behavioral performance, explaining similar portions of intersubject performance variance. Together, these findings suggest that intrinsic resting-state activity facilitates or is permissive of specific brain circuit engagement to perform a cognitive task, and that resting activity can predict subsequent task-evoked brain responses and behavioral performance.

    abstract = "Stroke lesions induce not only loss of local neural function, but disruptions in spatially distributed areas. However, it is unknown whether they affect the synchrony of electrical oscillations in neural networks and if changes in network coherence are associated with neurological deficits. This study assessed these questions in a population of patients with subacute, unilateral, ischemic stroke. Spontaneous cortical oscillations were reconstructed from high-resolution electroencephalograms (EEG) with adaptive spatial filters. Maps of functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas were created and correlated with patient performance in motor and cognitive scores. In comparison to age matched healthy controls, stroke patients showed a selective disruption of FC in the alpha frequency range. The spatial distribution of alpha band FC reflected the pattern of motor and cognitive deficits of the individual patient: network nodes that participate normally in the affected functions showed local decreases in FC with the rest of the brain. Interregional FC in the alpha band, but not in delta, theta, or beta frequencies, was highly correlated with motor and cognitive performance. In contrast, FC between contralesional areas and the rest of the brain was negatively associated with patient performance. Alpha oscillation synchrony at rest is a unique and specific marker of network function and linearly associated with behavioral performance. Maps of alpha synchrony computed from a single resting-state EEG recording provide a robust and convenient window into the functionality and organization of cortical networks with numerous potential applications",

    abstract = "More than 5 million deaths a year are attributable to tobacco smoking, making it the largest single cause of preventable death worldwide. The primary addictive component in tobacco is nicotine. Its addictive power is exemplified by the fact that by far most attempts to quit smoking fail. It is therefore mandatory to understand the biological mechanisms by which nicotine leads to continued smoking despite its harmful consequences. While current research perspectives on nicotine addiction emphasize the contribution of reward-related mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) systems, the role of the amygdala remains less well characterized, although it is crucially engaged in the emotional and motivational modulation of cognition and behavior. Consequently, we here review brain imaging studies reporting altered neural responses of the amygdala in nicotine addiction. A major focus is placed upon resting-state and cue-induction studies documenting that nicotine addiction is associated with aberrant amygdala activity. Importantly, unprovoked abstinence-induced nicotine cravings have been shown to interfere with the amygdala's ability to detect and adequately respond to harm signals. In light of this empirical evidence, we propose that impaired amygdala-guided harm avoidance and executive functions may be instrumental in maintaining nicotine addiction despite serious health consequences",

However, the extent to which genes influence the functional brain network early in development is not yet known. We report on the heritability of functional brain efficiency during early brain development. Using a twin design, young children underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans (N=86 from 21MZ and 22DZ twin-pairs, age=12 years). Functional connectivity, defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions, was explored using graph theory and its heritability was examined using structural equation modeling. Our findings suggest that 'global efficiency of communication' among brain regions is under genetic control (h(2)lambda=42\%), irrespectively of the total number of brain connections (connectivity density). In addition, no influence of genes or common environment to local clustering (gamma) was found, suggesting a less pronounced effect of genes on local information segregation. Thus our findings suggest that a set of genes is shaping the underlying architecture of functional brain communication during development",

    abstract = "OBJECT: In humans, even a single night of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) can have a negative impact on cognition and affective processing, suggesting that sleep pressure represents a basic physiological constraint of brain function. Among the spontaneously fluctuating resting state networks, the default mode network (DMN) and its anticorrelated network (ACN) hold key functions in segregating internally and externally directed awareness. Task fMRI after sleep deprivation has revealed altered activation patterns in both networks. We hypothesized that effects of PSD in these intrinsically coupled networks can be detected by resting state fMRI. METHODS: We obtained 6-minute echoplanar imaging time series (1.5 Tesla) during eyes-closed, wakeful-resting experiments from 16 healthy volunteers after normal sleep and after PSD. We used independent component and cross-correlation analysis to study functional connectivity (fc), focusing on the DMN and ACN. RESULTS: After PSD, focal reductions of auto-correlation strength were detected in the posterior and anterior midline node of the DMN and in the lateral parietal and insular nodes of the ACN. Cross-correlation analysis confirmed reduced cortico-cortical connectivity within and between the DMN and ACN. CONCLUSIONS: Increased sleep pressure is reflected in reduced fc of main DMN and ACN nodes during rest. Results have implications for understanding perceptual and cognitive changes after sleep deprivation and are relevant to clinical studies on conditions in which increased sleep propensity is present.",

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental challenge for understanding neuropsychiatric disease is identifying sources of individual differences in psychopathology, especially when there is substantial heterogeneity of symptom expression, such as is found in schizophrenia (SCZ). We hypothesized that such heterogeneity might arise in part from consistently widespread yet variably patterned alterations in the connectivity of focal brain regions.METHODS: We used resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to identify variable global dysconnectivity in 23 patients with DSM-IV SCZ relative to 22 age-, gender-, and parental socioeconomic status-matched control subjects with a novel global brain connectivity method that is robust to high variability across individuals. We examined cognitive functioning with a modified Sternberg task and subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. We measured symptom severity with the Scale for Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms.RESULTS: We identified a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) region with global and highly variable dysconnectivity involving within-PFC underconnectivity and non-PFC overconnectivity in patients. Variability in this "under/over" pattern of dysconnectivity strongly predicted the severity of cognitive deficits (matrix reasoning IQ, verbal IQ, and working memory performance) as well as individual differences in every cardinal symptom domain of SCZ (poverty, reality distortion, and disorganization).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that global dysconnectivity underlies dorsolateral PFC involvement in the neuropathology of SCZ. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the possibility that specific patterns of dysconnectivity with a given network hub region might explain individual differences in symptom presentation in SCZ. Critically, such findings might extend to other neuropathologies with diverse presentation.},

    abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with disturbances of neural connectivity. Functional connectivity between neural structures is typically examined within the context of a cognitive task, but also exists in the absence of a task (i.e., "rest"). Connectivity during rest is particularly active in a set of structures called the default network, which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex, lateral parietal cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus. We previously reported that adults with ASD relative to controls show areas of stronger and weaker connectivity within the default network. The objective of the present study was to examine the default network in adolescents with ASD. Sixteen adolescents with ASD and 15 controls participated in a functional MRI study. Functional connectivity was examined between a PCC seed and other areas of the default network. Both groups showed connectivity in the default network. Relative to controls, adolescents with ASD showed widespread weaker connectivity in nine of the eleven areas of the default network. Moreover, an analysis of symptom severity indicated that poorer social skills and increases in restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests correlated with weaker connectivity, whereas poorer verbal and non-verbal communication correlated with stronger connectivity in multiple areas of the default network. These findings indicate that adolescents with ASD show weaker connectivity in the default network than previously reported in adults with ASD. The findings also show that weaker connectivity within the default network is associated with specific impairments in ASD.},

This article provides an overview of diffusion magnetic resonance tractography methods with a focus on how future advances might address challenges in measuring brain connectivity. Parts of this review are somewhat provocative, in the hope that they may trigger discussions possibly lacking in a field where the apparent simplicity of the methods (compared to their functional magnetic resonance imaging counterparts) can hide some fundamental issues that ultimately hinder the interpretation of findings, and cast doubt as to what tractography can really teach us about human brain anatomy",

The analysis revealed a modification of the hierarchical organization of large-scale networks into smaller independent modules during NREM sleep, independently from EEG markers of the slow oscillation. Such modifications in brain connectivity, possibly driven by sleep ultraslow oscillations, could hinder the brain's ability to integrate information and account for decreased consciousness during NREM sleep",

Here, we argue that the aI, at least in part, plays a role in domain-general attentional control and highlight studies (Dosenbach et al. 2006; Dosenbach et al. 2007) supporting this view. Additionally, we discuss a study (Ploran et al. 2007) that implicates aI in processes related to the capture of focal attention. Task-level control and focal attention may or may not reflect information processing supported by a single functional area (within the aI). Therefore, we apply a novel technique (Cohen et al. 2008) that utilizes resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to determine whether separable regions exist within the aI. rs-fcMRI mapping suggests that the ventral portion of the aI is distinguishable from more dorsal/anterior regions, which are themselves distinct from more posterior parts of the aI. When these regions are applied to functional MRI (fMRI) data, the ventral and dorsal/anterior regions support processes potentially related to both task-level control and focal attention, whereas the more posterior aI regions did not. These findings suggest that there exists some functional heterogeneity within aI that may subserve related but distinct types of higher-order cognitive processing.",

Here we report that the spontaneous fluctuations in the local field potential (LFP) measured from a single cortical site in monkeys at rest exhibit widespread, positive correlations with fMRI signals over nearly the entire cerebral cortex. This correlation was especially consistent in a band of upper gamma-range frequencies (40-80 Hz), for which the hemodynamic signal lagged the neural signal by 6-8 s. A strong, positive correlation was also observed in a band of lower frequencies (2-15 Hz), albeit with a lag closer to zero. The global pattern of correlation with spontaneous fMRI fluctuations was similar whether the LFP signal was measured in occipital, parietal, or frontal electrodes. This coupling was, however, dependent on the monkey's behavioral state, being stronger and anticipatory when the animals' eyes were closed. These results indicate that the often discarded global component of fMRI fluctuations measured during the resting state is tightly coupled with underlying neural activity.",

This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network.

Posterior cingulate cortex connectivity was determined from 17 PTSD patients and 15 control subjects by investigating synchronic low-frequency fMRI signal fluctuations using a temporal correlation method. To assess the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and PCC connectivity, the contrast image representing areas correlated with the PCC was correlated with the 17 PTSD subjects' Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores at diagnosis. Compared with the control group, PTSD patients exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the right lingual and right middle temporal gyri, and left lingual/posterior cingulate cortex. The left inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus/insula, left medial frontal lobe/anterior cingulate cortex, and right medial frontal gyrus also showed increased connectivity within two days post accident. A negative correlation was found between PCC connectivity and CAPS scores in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).

    abstract = "Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), such as donepezil, have been shown to improve cognition in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In this paper, our goal is to determine the relationship between altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intrinsic functional network connectivity changes in mild AD patients before and after 12-week donepezil treatment. An integrative neuroimaging approach was employed by combining pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) methods to determine the changes in CBF and functional connectivity (FC) in the cholinergic pathway. Linear regression analyses determined the correlations of the regional CBF alterations and functional connectivity changes with cognitive responses. These were measured with the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) scores and Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores. Our results show that the regional CBF in mild AD subjects after donepezil treatment was significantly increased in the middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which are the neural substrates of the medial cholinergic pathway. In both brain regions, the baseline CBF and its changes after treatment were significantly correlated with the behavioral changes in ADAS-cog scores. The intrinsic FC was significantly enhanced in the medial cholinergic pathway network in the brain areas of the parahippocampal, temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Finally, the FC changes in the medial prefrontal areas demonstrated an association with the CBF level in the MCC and the PCC, and also were correlated with ADAS-cog score changes. These findings indicate that regional CBF and FC network changes in the medial cholinergic pathway were associated with cognitive performance. It also is suggested that the combined pCASL-MRI and R-fMRI methods could be used to detect regional CBF and FC changes when using drug treatments in mild AD subjects",

Prior neuroimaging studies have only examined the effects of sleep deprivation or partial sleep restriction on functional connectivity, but none have studied how such connectivity is associated with normal variations in self-reported sleep duration the night before the scan. We examined the relationship between sleep duration and resting state functional connectivity among healthy volunteers who slept at home according to their own schedules. Thirty-nine healthy individuals aged 18-45 (21 females) completed a questionnaire asking about their recent sleep habits and entries in their sleep diary for the previous night, followed by resting state functional MRI at 3 T. Participants reported sleeping between 5.0 and 8.5 h the night before the scan (M=7.0, SD=0.9). Seed regions were placed in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex nodes of the default mode network, regions previously implicated in sleep deprivation. Longer self-reported sleep duration was associated with significantly enhanced functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate, as well as greater anticorrelations with parietal, occipital, and lateral prefrontal regions. Findings suggest that even normal variations in sleep duration measured by self-report are related to the strength of functional connectivity within select nodes of the default mode network and its anticorrelated network",

The resting-state network corresponding to the dorsal attention network (DAN) was extracted by using independent component analysis (ICA) from each participant. Functional connectivity in the DAN was then compared between the patients and controls. In addition, the scores of Trail Making Test (TMT) in the patients were correlated to the z-score of the voxels showing significant difference between the two groups. Compared with the controls, the patients with mTLE presented decreased functional connectivity in almost all the regions within the DAN. Moreover, there were negative correlations between the TMT scores and the z-scores in the voxels showing decreased or increased functional connectivity in mTLE. Our results suggested that the alteration of DAN might underpin the impairment of top-down attention function in mTLE.

We observed relative areal contraction affecting Default Mode Network, Central Executive Network and Salience Network, in addition to other regions in schizophrenia. We confirmed the surface area reduction across these three large-scale brain networks by undertaking further region-of-interest analysis of surface area. We also observed a significant hemispheric asymmetry in the surface area changes, with the left hemisphere showing a greater reduction in the areal contraction maps.

    abstract = "Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition",

How this disease affects the central motor network is largely unknown. Here, we combined for the first time structural and functional imaging measures on the motor network in patients with ALS and healthy controls. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Structural measures included whole brain cortical thickness and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of crucial motor tracts. These structural measures were combined with functional connectivity analysis of the motor network based on resting state fMRI. Focal cortical thinning was observed in the primary motor area in patients with ALS compared to controls and was found to correlate with disease progression. DTI revealed reduced FA values in the corpus callosum and in the rostral part of the corticospinal tract. Overall functional organisation of the motor network was unchanged in patients with ALS compared to healthy controls, however the level of functional connectedness was significantly correlated with disease progression rate. Patients with increased connectedness appear to have a more progressive disease course. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate structural motor network deterioration in ALS with preserved functional connectivity measures. The positive correlation between functional connectedness of the motor network and disease progression rate could suggest spread of disease along functional connections of the motor network.",

    abstract = "The cognitive activity of the human brain benefits from the functional connectivity of multiple brain regions that form specific, functional brain networks. Recent studies have indicated that the relationship between brain regions can be investigated by examining the temporal interaction (known as functional connectivity) of spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals derived from resting-state functional MRI. Most of these studies plausibly assumed that inter-regional interactions were temporally stationary. However, little is known about the dynamic characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). In this study, we thoroughly examined this question within and between multiple functional brain networks. Twenty-two healthy subjects were scanned in a resting state. Several of the RSFC networks observed, including the default-mode, motor, attention, memory, auditory, visual, language and subcortical networks, were first identified using a conventional voxel-wise correlation analysis with predefined region of interests (ROIs). Then, a variable parameter regression model combined with the Kalman filtering method was employed to detect the dynamic interactions between each ROI and all other brain voxels within each of the RSFC maps extracted above. Experimental results revealed that the functional interactions within each RSFC map showed time-varying properties, and that approximately 10-20\% of the voxels within each RSFC map showed significant functional connectivity to each ROI during the scanning session. This dynamic pattern was also observed for the interactions between different functional networks. In addition, the spatial pattern of dynamic connectivity maps obtained from neighboring time points had a high similarity. Overall, this study provides insights into the dynamic properties of resting-state functional networks. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Autogenic training (AT) is a common clinically used relaxation method. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cerebral modulation of pain activity patterns due to AT and to correlate the effects to the degree of experience with AT and strength of stimuli. METHODS: Thirteen volunteers familiar with AT were studied with fMRI during painful electrical stimulation in a block design alternating between resting state and electrical stimulation, both without AT and while employing the same paradigm when utilizing their AT abilities. The subjective rating of painful stimulation and success in modulation during AT was assessed. RESULTS: During painful electrical stimulation without AT, fMRI revealed activation of midcingulate, right secondary sensory, right supplementary motor, and insular cortices, the right thalamus and left caudate nucleus. In contrast, utilizing AT only activation of left insular and supplementary motor cortices was revealed. The paired t-test revealed pain-related activation in the midcingulate, posterior cingulate and left anterior insular cortices for the condition without AT, and activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex under AT. Activation of the posterior cingulate cortex and thalamus correlated with the amplitude of electrical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an effect on cerebral pain processing while performing AT. This might represent the cerebral correlate of different painful stimulus processing by subjects who are trained in performing relaxation techniques. However, due to the absence of a control group, further studies are needed to confirm this theory",

A method to easily perform large-scale functional neuroimaging in mice would enable the discovery of functional correlates of genetic manipulations and bridge with mouse models of disease. To satisfy this need, we combined resting-state functional connectivity mapping with optical intrinsic signal imaging (fcOIS). We demonstrate functional connectivity in mice through highly detailed fcOIS mapping of resting-state networks across most of the cerebral cortex. Synthesis of multiple network connectivity patterns through iterative parcellation and clustering provides a comprehensive map of the functional neuroarchitecture and demonstrates identification of the major functional regions of the mouse cerebral cortex. The method relies on simple and relatively inexpensive camera-based equipment, does not require exogenous contrast agents and involves only reflection of the scalp (the skull remains intact) making it minimally invasive. In principle, fcOIS allows new paradigms linking human neuroscience with the power of molecular/genetic manipulations in mouse models.",

Among these patterns, the so-called default-mode network (DMN) has been attributed to the ongoing mental activity of the brain during wakeful resting state. Studies suggest that many neuropsychiatric diseases disconnect brain areas belonging to the DMN. The potential use of the DMN as functional imaging marker for individuals at risk for these diseases, however, requires that the components of the DMN are reproducible over time in healthy individuals. In this study, we assessed the reproducibility of the DMN components within and between imaging sessions in 18 healthy young subjects (mean age, 27.5 years) who were scanned three times with two resting state scans during each session at 3.0 T field strength. Statistical analysis of fMRI time-series was done using ICA implemented with BrainVoyager QX. At all three sessions the essential components of the DMN could be identified in each individual. Spatial extent of DMN activity and size of overlap within and between sessions were most reproducible for the anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus. The degree of reproducibility of the DMN agrees with the degree of reproducibility found with motor paradigms. We conclude that DMN coactivation patterns are reproducible in healthy young subjects. Therefore, these data can serve as basis to further explore the effects of aging and neuropsychiatric diseases on the DMN of the brain.",

The ICA with projection (ICAp) method proposed by our group (Hum Brain Mapp 2009;30:417-31) is demonstrated to be able to solve the interactions among task-related components for single subject fMRI data. However, it still must be determined if ICAp is capable of processing multi-task fMRI data over a group of subjects. Moreover, it is unclear whether ICAp can be reliably applied to event-related (ER) fMRI data.

Both a human fMRI rest data-based simulation and real fMRI experiments, of block design and ER design, verified the feasibility and reliability of group ICAp, as well as demonstrated that ICAp had the strength to separate 4D multi-task fMRI data into multiple brain networks engaged in each cognitive task and to adequately find the commonalities and differences among multiple tasks",

We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter "integration" of some regions into networks over time while "segregating" other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity MRI, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the evolution pattern of spontaneous brain activities in cirrhotic patients using resting-state fMRI with a regional homogeneity (ReHo) method.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Resting-state fMRI data were acquired in 47 cirrhotic patients (minimal HE [MHE], n = 20, and non-HE, n = 27) and 25 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) was used to measure the regional homogeneity. The regional homogeneity maps were compared with ANOVA tests among MHE, non-HE, and healthy control groups and t-tests between each pair in a voxel-wise way. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationships between regional ReHo values and Child-Pugh scores, number connection test type A (NCT-A), digit symbol test (DST) scores, venous blood ammonia levels. Compared with healthy controls, both MHE and non-HE patients showed decreased ReHo in the bilateral frontal, parietal and temporal lobes and increased ReHo in the bilateral caudate. Compared with the non-HE, MHE patients showed decreased ReHo in the bilateral precuneus, cuneus and supplementary motor area (SMA). The NCT-A of cirrhotic patients negatively correlated with ReHo values in the precuneus, cuneus and lingual gyrus. DST scores positively correlated with ReHo values in the cuneus, precuneus and lingual gyrus, and negatively correlated with ReHo values in the bilateral caudate (P<0.05, AlphaSim corrected).CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Diffused abnormal homogeneity of baseline brain activity was nonspecific for MHE, and only the progressively decreased ReHo in the SMA and the cuneus, especially for the latter, might be associated with the development of MHE. The ReHo analysis may be potentially valuable for detecting the development from non-HE to MHE",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have revealed that the DMN in the healthy brain is associated with stimulus-independent thought and self-reflection and that greater suppression of the DMN is associated with better performance on attention-demanding tasks. In schizophrenia and depression, the DMN is often found to be hyperactivated and hyperconnected. In schizophrenia this may relate to overly intensive self-reference and impairments in attention and working memory. In depression, DMN hyperactivity may be related to negative rumination. These findings are considered in terms of what is known about psychological functions supported by the DMN, and alteration of the DMN in other neuropsychiatric disorders",

Methods: We selected patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, n = 32), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE, n = 14), and posterior quadrant epilepsy (PQE, n = 20) from our 3 Tesla EEG-fMRI database. We applied group analysis upon the blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response associated with focal IEDs. Key Findings: Patients with TLE and FLE showed activations and deactivations, whereas in PQE only deactivations occurred. In TLE and FLE, the largest activation was in the mid-cingulate gyri bilaterally. In FLE, activations were also found in the ipsilateral frontal operculum, thalamus, and internal capsule, and in the contralateral cerebellum, whereas in TLE, we found additional activations in the ipsilateral mesial and neocortical temporal regions, insula, and cerebellar cortex. All three groups showed deactivations in default mode network regions, the most widespread being in the TLE group, and less in PQE and FLE. Significance: These results indicate that different epileptic syndromes result in unique and widespread networks related to focal IEDs. Default mode regions are deactivated in response to focal discharges in all three groups with syndrome specific pattern. We conclude that focal IEDs are associated with specific networks of widespread metabolic changes that may cause more substantial disturbance to brain function than might be appreciated from the focal nature of the scalp EEG discharges",

Here, we derived energy used for glutamatergic signaling in the awake resting human. We analyzed human data of electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) maps of oxygen (CMR(O2)) and glucose (CMR(glc)) utilization, and calibrated fMRI from a variety of experimental conditions. CMR(glc) and EEG in the visual cortex were tightly coupled over several conditions, showing that the oxidative demand for signaling was four times greater than the demand for nonsignaling events in the awake state. Variations of CMR(O2) and CMR(glc) from gray-matter regions and networks were within ±10\% of means, suggesting that most areas required similar energy for ubiquitously high resting activity. Human calibrated fMRI results suggest that changes of fMRI signal in cognitive studies contribute at most ±10\% CMR(O2) changes from rest. The PET data of sleep, vegetative state, and anesthesia show metabolic reductions from rest, uniformly >20\% across, indicating no region is selectively reduced when consciousness is lost.

A significant positive correlation was found between the average fractional anisotropy value of the cingulum tract and the level of functional connectivity between the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal cortex.

We analyzed the resting-connectivity patterns of the posterior cingulate cortex. We compared the DMN activity in the elderly depressed subjects with high versus low comorbid anxiety. RESULTS: Depressed elderly with high comorbid anxiety had increased functional connectivity in the posterior regions of the DMN and decreased functional connectivity in the anterior regions of the DMN.

In addition, we found that MFG reduced connectivity was negatively correlated with the pain intensity of migraine attacks. There were no structural differences between the two groups.Conclusions: Our data suggest that, even in the absence of clinically evident EF deficits, MwoA is associated with reduced FPN functional connectivity.

Changes in resting-state BOLD connectivity measures are typically interpreted as changes in coherent neural activity across spatially distinct brain regions. However, this interpretation can be complicated by the complex dependence of the BOLD signal on both neural and vascular factors. For example, prior studies have shown that vasoactive agents that alter baseline cerebral blood flow, such as caffeine and carbon dioxide, can significantly alter the amplitude and dynamics of the task-related BOLD response. In this study, we examined the effect of caffeine (200 mg dose) on resting-state BOLD connectivity in the motor cortex across a sample of healthy young subjects (N=9). We found that caffeine significantly (p<0.05) reduced measures of resting-state BOLD connectivity in the motor cortex. Baseline cerebral blood flow and spectral energy in the low-frequency BOLD fluctuations were also significantly decreased by caffeine. These results suggest that caffeine usage should be carefully considered in the design and interpretation of resting-state BOLD fMRI studies.",

    abstract = "Spontaneous fluctuations are a hallmark of recordings of neural signals, emergent over time scales spanning milliseconds and tens of minutes. However, investigations of intrinsic brain organization based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging have largely not taken into account the presence and potential of temporal variability, as most current approaches to examine functional connectivity (FC) implicitly assume that relationships are constant throughout the length of the recording. In this work, we describe an approach to assess whole-brain FC dynamics based on spatial independent component analysis, sliding time window correlation, and k-means clustering of windowed correlation matrices. The method is applied to resting-state data from a large sample (n = 405) of young adults. Our analysis of FC variability highlights particularly flexible connections between regions in lateral parietal and cingulate cortex, and argues against a labeling scheme where such regions are treated as separate and antagonistic entities. Additionally, clustering analysis reveals unanticipated FC states that in part diverge strongly from stationary connectivity patterns and challenge current descriptions of interactions between large-scale networks. Temporal trends in the occurrence of different FC states motivate theories regarding their functional roles and relationships with vigilance/arousal. Overall, we suggest that the study of time-varying aspects of FC can unveil flexibility in the functional coordination between different neural systems, and that the exploitation of these dynamics in further investigations may improve our understanding of behavioral shifts and adaptive processes",

Using an ETG-4000 Optical Topography System, the present study measured 29 adult subjects (14 females) over the sensorimotor and auditory cortexes during a resting session and a motor-localizer task session. The RSFC maps were computed by seed-based correlation analysis and data-driven cluster analysis. The results from both analyses showed robust RSFC maps, which were not only consistent with the localizer task-related activation results, but also those of previous fMRI findings. Moreover, the strong consistency between the seed-based correlation analysis and the data-driven cluster analysis further validated the use of fNIRS to assess RSFC. The potential influence of a specific low-frequency filtering range (0.04-0.15 Hz and 0.01-0.08 Hz) and three fNIRS parameters (oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, and total-Hb) on RSFC results were also examined.",

Few studies have considered impairments in heroin users from an integrated perspective for evaluation of their brain functions. We hypothesized that the brain regions that are dysregulated in the chronic heroin users during cue-reactivity studies may also show dysfunctional connectivity in memory, inhibition and motivation-related dysfunctions during a resting state free of cues. The present study used resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the interaction of brain regions between 12 chronic heroin users and 12 controls by employing a novel graph theory analysis (GTA) method. As a data-driven approach, GTA has the advantage of evaluating the strength as well as the temporal and spatial patterns of interactions among the brain regions. Abnormal topological properties were explored in the brain of chronic heroin users, such as the dysfunctional connectivity in the prefrontal cortex, ACC, SMA, ventral striatum, insula, amygdala and hippocampus. Our results suggest that GTA is a useful tool in defining dysregulated neural networks even during rest. This dysfunctional brain connectivity may contribute to decrease self-control, impaired inhibitory function as well deficits in stress regulation in chronic heroin users",

    title = "{Is sedation-induced BOLD fMRI low-frequency fluctuation increase mediated by increased motion?}",
    abstract = "OBJECT: Increases in low-frequency fluctuations (LFF, 0.01-0.1 Hz) of BOLD fMRI signal were observed during sedation and sleep. We tested the hypothesis that sedation-induced LFF increases may be mediated by increased head motion likely associated with these brain states. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned in resting-state baseline and (15 thereof) in midazolam sedation condition. After standard preprocessing, LFF power was computed from average time series from 14 ROIs representing 5 functional networks (visual, motor, auditory, default mode, dorsal attentional). We assessed the effects of sedation on LFF and indirect effects of head motion (mean relative displacement) using mediation analysis. RESULTS: Sedation increased LFF power with the indirect effect of motion on sedation-induced LFF significant for all networks. Global mean corrected data showed similar but weaker results: significant total effect for auditory, motor and visual; significant mediation for auditory and motor networks. Motion was strongly correlated with LFF even at baseline. Reported results were significant at p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that conscious sedation induces LFF increase, but demonstrates that this effect is mediated by increased head motion. Hence, caution in design and interpretation is recommended for studies comparing subjects or conditions differently predisposing to head motion.",

    abstract = {Animal research and human postmortem evidence highlight the importance of brain dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) function in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Separate anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicate disrupted frontal cortical connectivity with distributed brain networks in processes relevant for these diseases. This potential conjunction between molecular and functional markers has not, however, been tested directly. Here, we used a novel combination of [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the same healthy individuals to investigate whether differences in midbrain D3R availability are associated with functional interactions between large-scale networks and regions involved in reward processing and cognition. High midbrain D3R availability was associated with reduced functional connectivity between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and networks implicated in cognitive control and salience processing. The opposite pattern was observed in subcortical reward circuitry and the "default mode" network, which showed greater connectivity with OFC in individuals with high D3R availability. These findings demonstrate that differential interactions between OFC and networks implicated in cognitive control and reward are associated with midbrain D3R availability, consistent with the hypothesis that dopamine D3R signaling is an important molecular pathway underlying goal-directed behavior},

    abstract = "An innovative method to obtain fMRI resting-state network maps during non-invasive electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB) was developed and tested. Five healthy volunteers participated in 2 fMRI sessions. In session one, a transcranial direct current stimulator (tDCS) was applied placing the positive electrode (31.5cm(2)) over the right M1 of the cortex and the negative electrode (31.5cm(2)) over the left supra-orbital area of the head. In session two, a monophasic pulsed current stimulator (tPCS) was applied using the identical electrode placement. Imaging was performed on a Siemens 3T Tim Trio scanner with a 12-channel head coil. At each session, five consecutive functional scans were obtained: 1) resting-state without stimulation (Rest-1), 2) a motor scan consisting of self-paced, bilateral finger-thumb opposition task, 3) resting-state with ESB (Stim-1), 4) resting-state without stimulation (Rest-2), and 5) resting-state with ESB, replicating Stim-1 (Stim-2). Data were analyzed using AFNI and MATLAB. For motor task fMRI analysis, a general linear model (GLM) determined the voxels in the right and left M1 that were significantly correlated with the motor task paradigm. The resting-state time series from the voxels in the R-M1 were averaged and the resulting time series used as a regressor in a GLM analysis to identify M1 connectivity maps. Connectivity maps were quantified as R(2) values, and then combined to give overlap maps for each of the experimental conditions. Fourier analysis determined the energy in the normalized signal average time courses extracted from L-M1 and R-M1 for each of the resting-state scans. Both tDCS and tPCS lowered the R(2) values and energy of the averaged time course in the right and left M1 ROI. The effect of the tPCS appeared more pronounced and less variable among subjects. Applying non-invasive ESB during fMRI scanning may down regulate the motor cortex's resting-state network connectivity.",

Because the ability to effortlessly switch between concentration on a task and an idling state during rest is implicated in both these alterations, we undertook a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with a block design to analyze task-induced modulations in connectivity. METHODS: We performed a working memory task and psychophysiologic interaction analyses with the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex as seed regions during fixation in 12 patients with severe, chronic PTSD and 12 healthy controls. RESULTS: During the working memory task, the control group showed significantly stronger connectivity with areas implicated in the salience and executive networks, including the right inferior frontal gyrus and the right inferior parietal lobule. The PTSD group showed stronger connectivity with areas implicated in the default mode network, namely enhanced connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the right superior frontal gyrus and between the medial prefrontal cortex and the left parahippocampal gyrus. LIMITATIONS: Because we were studying alterations in patients with severe, chronic PTSD, we could not exclude patients taking medication. The small sample size may have limited the power of our analyses. To avoid multiple testing in a small sample, we only used 2 seed regions for our analyses. CONCLUSION: The different patterns of connectivity imply significant group differences with task-induced switches (i.e., engaging and disengaging the default mode network and the central-executive network).",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Needling at acupoints GB40 and KI3 was performed in 12 subjects separately. The specific coherent patterns, resting-state networks (RSNs), were retrieved by independent component analysis (ICA) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of resting state and post-acupuncture resting states, respectively. Then multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA) was applied to evaluate the effective connectivity within and among the detected RSNs-default model, memory, executive, auditory, and motor brain networks. RESULTS: Following acupuncture at GB40, the strength of causal connectivity between the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and anterior insula was enhanced, while the connection strength between the STG and postcentral gyrus increased following acupuncture at KI3. Additionally, the causal influences within the auditory network increased following acupuncture at GB40, in comparison with the executive network following acupuncture at KI3. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates that acupuncture at different acupoints could exert different modulatory effects on RSNs.

Brain regions showing such coherent fluctuations are thought to form organized networks known as 'resting-state' networks, a main representation of which is the default mode network. Spontaneous brain activity shows abnormalities in several neurological and psychiatric diseases that may reflect disturbances of ongoing thought processes. Information about the degree to which such spontaneous brain activity can be modulated may prove helpful in the development of treatment options. We investigated the effect of offline low-frequency rTMS on spontaneous neural activity, as measured with fMRI, using a sequential independent-component-analysis and regression approach to investigate local changes within the default mode network. RESULTS: We show that rTMS applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex results in distal changes of neural activity, relative to the site of stimulation, and that these changes depend on the patterns of brain network activity during 'resting-state'. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the proximal changes may reflect the off-line effect of direct stimulation of neural elements, the distal changes likely reflect modulation of functional connectivity.",

    abstract = "Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered EEG with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to acquire the voxelwise time series in 55 subjects with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 20), aMCI (n =15), and normal cognitive function (n = 20). The brains were divided into 116 regions of interest (ROIs). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficients of pairwise ROIs were used to classify these subjects. Error estimation of the classifications was performed with the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between changes in network connectivity strengths and behavioral scores.RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) yielded 87\% classification power, 85\% sensitivity, and 80\% specificity between the AD group and the non-AD group (subjects with aMCI and CN subjects) in the first-step classification. For differentiation between subjects with aMCI and CN subjects, AUC was 95\%; sensitivity, 93\%; and specificity, 90\%. The decreased network indexes were significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score in all tested subjects. Similarly, changes in network indexes significantly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Leaning Test delayed recall scores in subjects with aMCI and CN subjects.CONCLUSION: LSN analysis revealed that interconnectivity patterns of brain regions can be used to classify subjects with AD, those with aMCI, and CN subjects.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging allows investigating whole-brain connectivity changes during pharmacological modulation of the level of consciousness. METHODS: Low-frequency spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations were measured in 19 healthy volunteers during wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation with clinical unconsciousness, and subsequent recovery of consciousness. RESULTS: Propofol-induced decrease in consciousness linearly correlates with decreased corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity in frontoparietal networks (i.e., default- and executive-control networks). Furthermore, during propofol-induced unconsciousness, a negative correlation was identified between thalamic and cortical activity in these networks. Finally, negative correlations between default network and lateral frontoparietal cortices activity, present during wakefulness, decreased proportionally to propofol-induced loss of consciousness. In contrast, connectivity was globally preserved in low-level sensory cortices, (i.e., in auditory and visual networks across sedation stages). This was paired with preserved thalamocortical connectivity in these networks. Rather, waning of consciousness was associated with a loss of cross-modal interactions between visual and auditory networks. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed light on the functional significance of spontaneous brain activity fluctuations observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. They suggest that propofol-induced unconsciousness could be linked to a breakdown of cerebral temporal architecture that modifies both within- and between-network connectivity and thus prevents communication between low-level sensory and higher-order frontoparietal cortices, thought to be necessary for perception of external stimuli. They emphasize the importance of thalamocortical connectivity in higher-order cognitive brain networks in the genesis of conscious perception.",

In humans, these slow BOLD variations are thought to reflect an underlying or intrinsic form of brain functional connectivity in discrete neuroanatomical systems. While these 'resting-state networks' may be relatively enduring phenomena, other evidence suggest that dynamic changes in their functional connectivity may also emerge depending on the brain state of subjects during scanning.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we examined healthy subjects (n = 24) with a mood induction paradigm during two continuous fMRI recordings to assess the effects of a change in self-generated mood state (neutral to sad) on the functional connectivity of these resting-state networks (n = 24). Using independent component analysis, we identified five networks that were common to both experimental states, each showing dominant signal fluctuations in the very low frequency domain (approximately 0.04 Hz). Between the two states, we observed apparent increases and decreases in the overall functional connectivity of these networks. Primary findings included increased connectivity strength of a paralimbic network involving the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insula cortices with subjects' increasing sadness and decreased functional connectivity of the 'default mode network'.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support recent studies that suggest the functional connectivity of certain resting-state networks may, in part, reflect a dynamic image of the current brain state.

Previous studies delineated the anatomical boundaries and functional connectivity of the SMA. However, it is unclear whether the preSMA, which responds to a variety of behavioral tasks, comprises functionally distinct areas. With 24 seed regions systematically demarcated throughout the anterior and posterior medial SFC, we examined here the functional divisions of the medial SFC on the basis of the "correlograms" of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 225 adult individuals. In addition to replicating segregation of the SMA and posterior preSMA, the current results elucidated functional connectivities of anterior preSMA-the most anterior part of the medial SFC. In contrast to the caudal medial SFC, the anterior preSMA is connected with most of the prefrontal but not with somatomotor areas. Overall, the SMA is strongly connected to the thalamus and epithalamus, the posterior preSMA to putamen, pallidum, and subthalamic nucleus, and anterior preSMA to the caudate, with the caudate showing significant hemispheric asymmetry.

    abstract = "Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated both structural and functional damages in heroin-dependent individuals. However, few studies investigated gray matter deficits and abnormal resting-state networks together in heroin-dependent individuals. In the present study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to identify brain regions with gray matter density reduction. Resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis was employed to assess potential functional abnormalities during resting-state. All clinical significances were investigated by examining their association with duration of heroin use. Compared with healthy subjects, heroin-dependent individuals showed significant reduction in gray matter density in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a decrease in resting-state functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and left inferior parietal lobe (IPL). The gray matter density of the right DLPFC and its resting-state functional connectivity with the left IPL both showed significantly negative correlation with duration of heroin use, which were likely to be related to the functional impairments in decision-making and cognitive control exhibited by heroin-dependent individuals. Our findings demonstrated that long heroin dependence impairs the right DLPFC in heroin-dependent individuals, including structural deficits and resting-state functional impairments.",

    abstract = "Recent advancement in functional brain imaging techniques has revealed much of the global effects of general anesthetics on the human brain. General anesthetics preferentially suppress specific brain areas including the parietal association cortex and the thalamus, part of which appears to mirror the default mode network. Low-level sensory areas are relatively preserved and remain activated even under deep sedation by anesthetics. Functional connectivity analysis by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that general anesthetics moderately suppress functional connectivity of the default mode network. Midazolam-induced loss of consciousness is associated with remarkable suppression of cortico-cortical propagation of evoked currents. Overall, those results prompt us to hypothesize that general anesthetics induce loss of consciousness by disrupting the integrative properties of the cerebral cortex.",

    abstract = "This study sought to test for differences in regional brain activity between stage-1 sleep immediately following wake and immediately preceding stage-2 sleep. Data were collected during daytime fMRI sessions with simultaneous EEG acquisition. A stage-1 interval was defined as follows: > or =30s of wake, immediately followed by > or =60s of continuous stage 1, immediately followed by > or =30s of stage 2. We compared brain activity between the first 30s of stage 1 (early stage 1), the last 30s of stage 1 (late stage 1), and isolated wake. A conjunction analysis sorted each voxel into one of a series of mutually exclusive categories that represented the various possible combinations of a significant increase, decrease, or no difference among these three states. The initial dataset consisted of 14 healthy volunteers. A total of 22 sessions in these participants yielded six stage-1 intervals (from four participants) that met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. There were multiple clusters of significant voxels. Examples include changes in default-mode network areas where activity increased compared to wake only in early stage 1 and a bilateral change in the hippocampus where activity increased compared to wake only in late stage 1. These results suggest that activity in anatomically identifiable, volumetric brain regions exhibit differences during stage-1 sleep that would not have been detected with the EEG. These differences may also have specific relevance to understanding the process of sleep onset as well as the neural mechanisms of performance lapses during sleep deprivation",

    abstract = "Objective: To determine whether functional connectivity is altered in subjects with mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene who were asymptomatic but were destined to develop dementia, and to compare these findings to those in subjects with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Methods: In this case-control study, we identified 8 asymptomatic subjects with mutations in MAPT and 8 controls who screened negative for mutations in MAPT. Twenty-one subjects with a clinical diagnosis of bvFTD were also identified and matched to 21 controls. All subjects had resting-state fMRI. In-phase functional connectivity was assessed between a precuneus seed in the default mode network (DMN) and a fronto-insular cortex seed in the salience network, and the rest of the brain. Atlas-based parcellation was used to assess functional connectivity and gray matter volume across specific regions of interest. Results: The asymptomatic MAPT subjects and subjects with bvFTD showed altered functional connectivity in the DMN, with reduced in-phase connectivity in lateral temporal lobes and medial prefrontal cortex, compared to controls. Increased in-phase connectivity was also observed in both groups in the medial parietal lobe. Only the bvFTD group showed altered functional connectivity in the salience network, with reduced connectivity in the fronto-insular cortex and anterior cingulate. Gray matter loss was observed across temporal, frontal, and parietal regions in bvFTD, but not in the asymptomatic MAPT subjects. Conclusions: Functional connectivity in the DMN is altered in MAPT subjects before the occurrence of both atrophy and clinical symptoms, suggesting that changes in functional connectivity are early features of the disease. © 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.",

Alternatively, the power of low frequency fluctuation (LFF) may also be used as a biomarker to assess spontaneous activity. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether the amplitude of the LFF (ALFF) relates to cerebral physiological states. Ten healthy subjects underwent four resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, two for eyes-open (EO) and two for eyes-closed (EC) conditions, with two sets of parameters (TR=400 ms and 2 s, respectively). After data preprocessing, ALFF was obtained by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in the frequency range of 0.01-0.08 Hz. Our results showed that the ALFF in EO was significantly higher than that in EC (P<0.05, corrected) in the bilateral visual cortices. Furthermore, the ALFF in EO was significantly reduced in the right paracentral lobule (PCL) than in EC (P<0.05, corrected). Region of interest (ROI) analysis showed that the ALFF differences between EO and EC were consistent for each subject. In contrast, no significant ALFF differences were found between EO and EC (P<0.381) in the posterior cingulate cortex. All these results agree well with previous studies comparing EO and EC states. Our finding of the distinct ALFF difference between EO and EC in the visual cortex implies that the ALFF may be a novel biomarker for physiological states of the brain",

These connections are modulated due to development, learning, and disease. Momentary adaptations in functional connectivity alter the structural connections, which in turn affect the functional connectivity. Thus, structural and functional connectivity interact on a broad timescale. In this study, we aimed to explore distinct measures of connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging and their association to the dominant electroencephalogram oscillatory property at rest: the individual alpha frequency (IAF). We found that in 21 healthy young subjects, small intraindividual temporal IAF fluctuations were correlated to increased blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in brain areas associated to working memory functions and to the modulation of attention. These areas colocalized with functionally connected networks supporting the respective functions. Furthermore, subjects with higher IAF show increased fractional anisotropy values in fascicles connecting the above-mentioned areas and networks. Hence, due to a multimodal approach a consistent functionally and structurally connected network related to IAF was observed",

The whole thalamus show negative correlations with the visual cortex and positive correlations with its contralateral counterpart in eyes closed condition, but which are significantly decreased in eyes open condition, consistent with previous findings of electroencephalography desynchronization during eyes open resting state. Furthermore, we find that bilateral thalamic mediodorsal nuclei and bilateral ventrolateral nuclei have remarkably similar connectivity maps, and resemble to those of the whole thalamus, suggesting their crucial contributions to the thalamus-visual correlations. The bilateral pulvinar nuclei are found to show distinct functional connectivity patterns, compatible with previous findings of the asymmetry of anatomical and functional organization in the nuclei. Our data provides evidence for the associations of intrinsic spontaneous neuronal activity between the thalamus and visual cortex under different resting conditions, which might have implications on the understanding of the generation and modulation of the alpha rhythm.",

    abstract = "Functional neuroimaging studies have identified multiple nodes of dysfunction in frontostriatal and mesocorticolimbic networks in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Yet relatively few studies have examined how structural and functional connectivity between nodes in these networks might relate to the behavioral symptoms of ADHD. Moreover, it is unknown whether abnormalities in connectivity are a primary cause of symptoms or arise secondary to common etiologic mechanisms. We review the most recent diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of connectivity in ADHD to characterize associations between frontostriatal connectivity abnormalities and the behavioral symptoms of inattention and impulsivity in ADHD. Furthermore, we examine how structural and functional connectivity measures relate to environmental and genetic pathways to ADHD. Diffusion tensor imaging studies indicate that ADHD is associated with significant irregularities in white matter microstructure, especially in frontostriatal and select corticocortical tracts. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies implicate altered connectivity within a default mode network of structures active during introspective, task-free processes and disrupted interactions between this network and frontostriatal attentional systems. Deficits in functional connectivity within frontostriatal and mesocorticolimbic networks might give rise, in part, to ADHD symptoms. Conversely, structural connectivity deficits and ADHD symptoms might arise incidentally from a common etiologic mechanism, involving altered modulation of synaptic potentiation and pruning by dopamine and other factors during development. Collectively, these studies suggest that the core symptoms of ADHD might derive from dysregulated modulation of cortical plasticity in the developing brain, resulting in altered patterns of corticocortical connectivity that might persist into adulthood",

    abstract = "Although, on average, the magnitude of alpha oscillations (8 to 12 Hz) is decreased in task-relevant cortices during externally oriented attention, its fluctuations have significant consequences, with increased level of alpha associated with decreased level of visual processing and poorer behavioral performance. Functional MRI signals exhibit similar fluctuations. The default mode network (DMN) is on average deactivated in cognitive tasksrequiring externally oriented attention.Momentarily insufficient deactivation of DMN, however, is often accompanied by decreased efficiency in stimulus processing, leading to attentional lapses. These observations appear to suggest that visual alpha power and DMN activitymay be positively correlated. To what extent such correlation is preserved in the resting state is unclear. We addressed this problem by recording simultaneous EEG-fMRI from healthy human participants undertwo resting-state conditions:eyes-closed and eyes-open. Short-time visual alpha power was extracted astime series, which were thenconvolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), and correlated with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)signals.It was found thatvisual alpha power was positively correlated with DMN BOLD activityonly whenthe eyes were open; no such correlation existed when the eyes were closed.Functionally, this could be interpreted as indicating that (1) under the eyes-open condition, strong DMN activity is associated with reduced visual cortical excitability, which serves to block external visual input from interfering with introspective mental processing mediated by DMN,whileweak DMN activity is associated with increased visual cortical excitability, which helps to facilitate stimulus processing, and (2) under the eyes-closed condition, the lack of external visual input renders such a gating mechanism unnecessary",

Most studies used Pearson correlation coefficients among the BOLD signals from different brain regions to quantify functional connectivity. Since the Pearson correlation analysis only provides a limited description of functional connectivity, we investigated functional connectivity between the dACC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in three groups (adult patients with ADHD, n = 21; TD age-matched subjects, n = 21; young TD subjects, n = 21) using a more comprehensive analytical approach - unsupervised machine learning using a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) that quantifies an abnormality index for each individual. The median abnormality index for patients with ADHD was greater than for TD age-matched subjects (p = 0.014); the ADHD and young TD indices did not differ significantly (p = 0.480); the median abnormality index of young TD was greater than that of TD age-matched subjects (p = 0.016). Low frequencies below 0.05 Hz and around 0.20 Hz were the most relevant for discriminating between ADHD patients and TD age-matched controls and between the older and younger TD subjects. In addition, we validated our approach using the fMRI data of children publicly released by the ADHD-200 Competition, obtaining similar results. Our findings suggest that the abnormal coherence patterns observed in patients with ADHD in this study resemble the patterns observed in young typically developing subjects, which reinforces the hypothesis that ADHD is associated with brain maturation deficits",

However, the continuous stimulation characteristic of EA treatment presents challenges to the use of conventional functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) approaches for the investigation of neural mechanisms mediating treatment response because of the requirement for brief and intermittent stimuli in event related or block designed task paradigms. A relatively new analysis method, functional connectivity fMRI (fcMRI), has great potential for studying continuous treatment modalities such as EA. In a previous study, we found that, compared with sham acupuncture, EA can significantly reduce Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) activity when subsequently evoked by experimental pain. Given the PAG's important role in mediating acupuncture analgesia, in this study we investigated functional connectivity with the area of the PAG we previously identified and how that connectivity was affected by genuine and sham EA.RESULTS: Forty-eight subjects, who were randomly assigned to receive either genuine or sham EA paired with either a high or low expectancy manipulation, completed the study. Direct comparison of each treatment mode's functional connectivity revealed: significantly greater connectivity between the PAG, left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus for the contrast of genuine minus sham; significantly greater connectivity between the PAG and right anterior insula for the contrast of sham minus genuine; no significant differences in connectivity between different contrasts of the two expectancy levels.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the intrinsic functional connectivity changes among key brain regions in the pain matrix and default mode network during genuine EA compared with sham EA. We speculate that continuous genuine EA stimulation can modify the coupling of spontaneous activity in brain regions that play a role in modulating pain perception",

This is the first time functional connectivity measurements are performed in a non-mammalian species. Since the visual system of pigeons is a well-known model for brain asymmetry, the focus of the study was on the neural substrate of the visual system. For fMRI a visual stimulus was used and functional connectivity measurements were done with the entopallium (E; analog for the primary visual cortex) as a seed region. Interestingly in awake pigeons the left E was significantly functionally connected to the right E. Moreover we compared connectivity maps for a seed region in both hemispheres resulting in a stronger bilateral connectivity starting from left E then from right E. These results could be used as a starting point for further imaging studies in awake birds and also provide a new window into the analysis of hemispheric dominance in the pigeon",

The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that functional impairment associated with the histopathological findings exists in the motor cortex of MSA patients using resting-state fMRI. Twenty clinically probable MSA patients (9 with MSA-P and 11 with MSA-C subtype) and 11 healthy controls (HCs) were studied. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was used to analyze low frequency spontaneous fluctuation of blood oxygen level dependent signal. Compared with the HCs, the MSA patients showed significantly decreased ReHo in the left primary sensorimotor cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), together with increased ReHo in the right primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortices, bilateral supplementary motor areas, medial PFC and left IPL. The results support the hypothesis that motor cortex areas can be functionally involved and likely play a role in motor circuit dysfunction in MSA patients.",

    abstract = "Previous effective connectivity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed dynamic causal streams along the dorsal attention network (DAN) during voluntary attentional control in the human brain. During resting state, however, fMRI has shown that the DAN is also intrinsically configured by functional connectivity, even in the absence of explicit task demands, and that may conflict with effective connectivity studies. To resolve this contradiction, we performed an effective connectivity analysis based on partial Granger causality (pGC) on event-related fMRI data during Posner's cueing paradigm while optimizing experimental and imaging parameters for pGC analysis. Analysis by pGC can factor out exogenous or latent influences due to unmeasured variables. Typical regions along the DAN with greater activation during orienting than withholding of attention were selected as regions of interest (ROIs). pGC analysis on fMRI data from the ROIs showed that frontal-to-parietal top-down causal streams along the DAN appeared during (voluntary) orienting, but not during other, less-attentive and/or resting-like conditions. These results demonstrate that these causal streams along the DAN exclusively mediate voluntary covert orienting. These findings suggest that neural representations of attention in frontal regions are at the top of the hierarchy of the DAN for embodying voluntary attentional control.",

However, it is less clear to what extent abnormalities are exhibited in ventral prefrontal and limbic regions, despite their involvement in social cognitive dysfunction and aggression, which represent problem domains for patients with schizophrenia. Previously, we found that reduced white matter integrity in right inferior frontal regions was associated with higher levels of aggression. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine amygdala/ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) functional connectivity (FC) and its relation to aggression in schizophrenia. Twenty-one healthy controls and 25 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated. Aggression was measured using the Buss Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Regions of interest were placed in the amygdala based on previously published work. A voxelwise FC analysis was performed in which the mean time series across voxels for this bilateral amygdala seed was entered as a predictor in a multiple regression model with motion parameters and global, cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter signals as covariates. Patients showed significant reductions in FC between amygdala and vPFC regions. Moreover, in patients, the strength of this connection showed a significant inverse relationship with aggression, such that lower FC was associated with higher levels of self-rated aggression. Similar results were obtained for 2 other measures--Life History of Aggression and total arrests. These results suggest that amygdala/vPFC FC is compromised in schizophrenia and that this compromise is associated with aggression.",

The "frame and fill" model of object recognition posits that low spatial frequency (LSF) information rapidly reaches the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and creates a general shape of an object that feeds back to the ventral temporal cortex to assist object recognition. Visual dysfunction findings in schizophrenia suggest a preferential loss of LSF information. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to investigate the contribution of visual deficits to impaired object "framing" circuitry in schizophrenia. Participants were shown object stimuli that were intact or contained only LSF or high spatial frequency (HSF) information. For controls, fMRI revealed preferential activation to LSF information in precuneus, superior temporal, and medial and dorsolateral PFC areas, whereas patients showed a preference for HSF information or no preference. RSFC revealed a lack of connectivity between early visual areas and PFC for patients. These results demonstrate impaired processing of LSF information during object recognition in schizophrenia, with patients instead displaying increased processing of HSF information. This is consistent with findings of a preference for local over global visual information in schizophrenia},

However, recent studies have suggested that the effects of 5-HTTLPR may be specific to different ethnic groups. Few studies have been conducted to address this issue.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on thirty-eight healthy Han Chinese subjects (l/l group, n = 19; s/s group, n = 19) during the resting state and during an emotional processing task. Compared with the s/s group, the l/l group showed significantly increased regional homogeneity or local synchronization in the right amygdala during the resting state (|t|>2.028, p<0.05, corrected), but no significant difference was found in the bilateral amygdala in response to negative stimuli in the emotional processing task.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 5-HTTLPR can alter the spontaneous activity of the amygdala in Han Chinese. However, the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala both in task state and resting state in Asian population was no similar with Caucasians. They suggest that the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala may be modulated by ethnic differences",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (MR) data were compared between healthy controls and the following groups of cirrhotic patients: (a) patients without MHE and without previous OHE, (b) patients with current MHE and without previous OHE, and (c) patients with previous OHE. Independent component analysis was applied to identify the best-fit component for the default-mode network (DMN). One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect different FC among groups. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between FC and neurocognitive performance.Results:Two important regions within the DMN, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex and left medial frontal gyrus, showed significantly different FC among the four groups. A trend of gradually reduced FC in two regions was observed from controls, to patients without HE, and to patients with current MHE, while patients with previous OHE showed remarkably reduced FC in these two regions. Significant correlations were found between FC and neurocognitive performance in cirrhotic patients.Conclusion:The reduced resting-state FC within DMN was associated with neurocognitive impairments in MHE and after clinical resolution of OHE. Previous OHE rather than current MHE might be primarily related to brain dysfunction in patients with latent OHE.© RSNA, 2012Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.12120026/-/DC1",

    abstract = {Cognitively demanding tasks that evoke activation in the brain's central-executive network (CEN) have been consistently shown to evoke decreased activation (deactivation) in the default-mode network (DMN). The neural mechanisms underlying this switch between activation and deactivation of large-scale brain networks remain completely unknown. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the mechanisms underlying switching of brain networks in three different experiments. We first examined this switching process in an auditory event segmentation task. We observed significant activation of the CEN and deactivation of the DMN, along with activation of a third network comprising the right fronto-insular cortex (rFIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when participants perceived salient auditory event boundaries. Using chronometric techniques and Granger causality analysis, we show that the rFIC-ACC network, and the rFIC, in particular, plays a critical and causal role in switching between the CEN and the DMN. We replicated this causal connectivity pattern in two additional experiments: (i) a visual attention "oddball" task and (ii) a task-free resting state. These results indicate that the rFIC is likely to play a major role in switching between distinct brain networks across task paradigms and stimulus modalities. Our findings have important implications for a unified view of network mechanisms underlying both exogenous and endogenous cognitive control},

    abstract = "Recent evidence suggests that some brain areas act as hubs interconnecting distinct, functionally specialized systems. These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset (n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) because some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging in AD (n = 10) compared with older controls (n = 29) showed high amyloid-beta deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in AD",

This study characterized widespread injury effects on multiple integrated neural networks typically observed during a task-unconstrained "resting state" in mild TBI patients. Whole brain functional connectivity for twelve separate networks was identified using independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data collected from thirty mild TBI patients mostly free of macroscopic intracerebral injury and thirty demographically-matched healthy control participants. Voxelwise group comparisons found abnormal mild TBI functional connectivity in every brain network identified by ICA, including visual processing, motor, limbic, and numerous circuits believed to underlie executive cognition. Abnormalities not only included functional connectivity deficits, but also enhancements possibly reflecting compensatory neural processes. Postconcussive symptom severity was linked to abnormal regional connectivity within nearly every brain network identified, particularly anterior cingulate. A recently developed multivariate technique that identifies links between whole brain profiles of functional and anatomical connectivity identified several novel mild TBI abnormalities, and represents a potentially important new tool in the study of the complex neurobiological sequelae of TBI},

We wanted to find out whether the ReHo of resting-state activity can be used to detect regional signal synchrony alterations in children with non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Twenty-one TLE patients were compared with age and gender-matched healthy controls. Significantly increased ReHo was discovered in the posterior cingulate gyrus and the right medial temporal lobe of the patients, and they also had significantly decreased ReHo in the cerebellum compared with the healthy controls. However, the alterations in ReHo differed between the patients with normal and abnormal interictal EEGs, the latter showing significantly increased ReHo in the right fusiform gyrus and significantly decreased ReHo in the right medial frontal gyrus relative to the controls, while those with normal EEGs had significantly increased ReHo in the right inferior temporal gyrus and the left posterior cingulate gyrus.

We tested whether hyperactive MFC-based performance monitoring function relates to altered MFC connectivity within task control and default mode networks in pediatric patients. METHODS: Eighteen pairs of OCD and matched healthy youth underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance monitoring and at rest. Task-related hyperactivations in the posterior and ventral MFC were used as seeds for connectivity analyses during task and resting state. RESULTS: In posterior MFC, patients showed greater activation of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) than control subjects, with greater activation predicting worse performance. In ventral MFC, control subjects exhibited deactivation, whereas patients activated this region. Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased dACC-ventral MFC connectivity during task and decreased dACC-right anterior operculum and ventral MFC-posterior cingulate connectivity during rest. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive activation and increased interactions of posterior and ventral MFC during performance monitoring may combine with reduced resting state connectivity of these regions within networks for task control and default mode to reflect early markers of OCD. Alteration of reciprocal interactions between these networks could potentiate the intrusion of ventral MFC-based affectively laden, self-referential thoughts, while disrupting posterior MFC-based performance-monitoring function in young patients.",

    abstract = "We investigated the influence of circadian rhythmicity and wake-up time on fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) derived resting-state data in 15 subjects by evaluating the time course of 20 brain connectivity patterns over 8h (4 sessions). For each subject, we determined the chronotype, which describes the relationship between the individual circadian rhythm and the local time. We detected highly significant correlations (r=0.82-0.9; p(corr)<0.00125) between chronotype and the daily time of maximum connectivity strength. Notably, this strong association was present for all 20 connectivity patterns, i.e., not only for the 16 patterns considered as resting-state networks, but also for 4 patterns that appeared to represent non-neural physiological noise (e.g., pulsation of cerebrospinal fluid or large vessels). This finding suggests that the observed circadian influence is not restricted to purely neural activity of the brain in the resting-state. No significant correlations were found between wake-up time and the daily time of maximum connectivity strength within any of the connectivity patterns (r=0.57-0.70, p(corr)>0.00125). We conclude that chronotype generally influences fMRI derived resting-state connectivity patterns, but not necessarily resting-state neural activity. We hypothesize that the association between chronotype and resting-state connectivity patterns is primarily based on circadian rhythms in cardiovascular and respiratory functions, which both may essentially account for the signal time courses measured with fMRI",

For any new technique or new methodology, it is necessary to be able to replicate similar experiments using different instruments in order to establish its liability and reproducibility. We apply two different diffuse optical tomographic (DOT) systems (i.e., DYNOT and CW5), with various probe arrangements to evaluate RSFC in the sensorimotor cortex by utilizing a previously published experimental protocol and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results exhibit similar spatial patterns and strengths in RSFC between the bilateral motor cortexes. The consistent observations are obtained from both DYNOT and CW5 systems, and are also in good agreement with the previous fNIRS study. Overall, we demonstrate that the fNIRS-based RSFC is reproducible by various DOT imaging systems among different research groups, enhancing the confidence of neuroscience researchers and clinicians to utilize fNIRS for future applications",

    abstract = "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can up- and down-regulate cortical excitability depending on current direction, however our abilities to measure brain-tissue effects of the stimulation and its after-effects have been limited so far. We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1\%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6\%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5\%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area. Our results indicate that ASL may be an excellent tool to investigate the effects of tDCS and its stimulation parameters on brain activity",

These observations of altered resting-state functional connectivity suggested abnormal functional organization in the addicted brain and may provide additional evidence supporting the theory of addiction that emphasizes enhanced salience value of a drug and its related cues but weakened cognitive control in the addictive state.",

However, little is known about the neural correlates of the association between depressive symptoms and memory deficits in nondemented elderly. Fifteen amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 20 cognitively normal (CN) subjects completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) scans. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to test the main effects of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall (RAVLT-DR) scores, and their interaction on the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity (AFC) network activity. Severer depressive symptoms and memory deficits were found in the aMCI group than in the CN group. Partial correlation analysis identified that the RAVLT-DR scores were significantly correlated with the AFC network in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial and anterior prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), middle occipital gyrus, right inferior parietal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). The GDS scores were positively correlated with the AFC network in the bilateral PCC and MTG, and left DLPFC. The interactive effects of the GDS and RAVLT-DR scores on the AFC network were seen in the bilateral PCC, MTG, and left DLPFC. These findings not only supported that there were interactive neural links between depressive symptoms and memory functions in nondemented elderly at the system level, but also demonstrated that R-fMRI has advantages in investigating the interactive nature of different neural networks involved in complex functions, such as emotion and cognition",

However, the biochemical underpinnings of the PACC's high resting state activity remain unclear. While animal-based evidence points toward a role for the glutamatergic system, the modulation of the resting state activity level by itself as distinguished from stimulus-induced activity remains to be shown in humans. Using combined fMRI-MRS in healthy subjects, we here demonstrate that the PACC resting state concentration of glutamate is directly related to the level of resting state activity in the same region. In contrast, no such relationship could be detected during the anticipation of reward and punishment, nor in an independent control region (the left anterior insula). Taken together, our findings demonstrate for the first time the modulation of the PACC resting state activity level by the concentration of glutamate in the same regions. This contributes to a better understanding of the biochemical basis for the brain's resting state activity as well as providing some clues regarding its apparent pathological upregulation in psychiatric disorders like the major depressive disorder",

A T2*-weighted fast echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence was employed at 1.5 T to acquire three sets of brain images for each subject under three conditions (at rest, after saline injection, and after cocaine injection [0.57 mg/kg]). Cross-correlation maps were constructed using the synchronous, low frequency signal from voxel time courses after filtering respiratory, cardiac, and other physiological noise. A quantitative evaluation of the changes in functional connectivity was made using spatial correlation coefficient (SCC) analysis. A marked 50\% reduction in SCC values in the region of primary visual cortex and 43\% reduction in SCC values in the region of primary motor cortex were observed after cocaine administration. This significant reduction in SCC values in these cortical regions is a reflection of changes in neuronal activity. It is suggested that the observed changes in low frequency components after acute cocaine administration during a resting, no-task situation may be used as a baseline reference source when assessing the effects of cocaine on task-driven activation or on mesolimbic dopamine pathways",

Thereafter, event-related paradigm was undertaken using sad facial stimuli. The resting-state fMRI signal was deemed as the baseline of each subject's activity. Coefficient marks were designed to sort and select temporal independent components of event-related signals. Thereafter, stimulus-evoked BOLD response components inside event-related signal were extracted and taken as features to discriminate depressive patients from healthy controls. RESULTS: Accuracy rate for depression recognition was 77.27\% with P value of .017 for whole-brain analysis and 81.82\% with P value of .009 for region-of-interest analysis. The effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method for disease recognition were demonstrated via the performance comparison with three other typical methods.

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine low-frequency (0.008 < f < 0.08 Hz) coherence of cognitively relevant and sensory brain networks in older adults who participated in a 1-year intervention trial, comparing the effects of aerobic and non-aerobic fitness training on brain function and cognition. Results showed that aerobic training improved the aging brain's resting functional efficiency in higher-level cognitive networks. One year of walking increased functional connectivity between aspects of the frontal, posterior, and temporal cortices within the Default Mode Network and a Frontal Executive Network, two brain networks central to brain dysfunction in aging. Length of training was also an important factor. Effects in favor of the walking group were observed only after 12 months of training, compared to non-significant trends after 6 months. A non-aerobic stretching and toning group also showed increased functional connectivity in the DMN after 6 months and in a Frontal Parietal Network after 12 months, possibly reflecting experience-dependent plasticity. Finally, we found that changes in functional connectivity were behaviorally relevant. Increased functional connectivity was associated with greater improvement in executive function. Therefore the study provides the first evidence for exercise-induced functional plasticity in large-scale brain systems in the aging brain, using functional connectivity techniques, and offers new insight into the role of aerobic fitness in attenuating age-related brain dysfunction",

At baseline, depressed patients had decreased corticolimbic LFBF correlations compared to healthy subjects during the resting state and on exposure to emotionally valenced pictures. At rest and on exposure to neutral and positive pictures, LFBF correlation between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic regions was significantly increased in patients after treatment. However, on exposure to negative pictures, corticolimbic LFBF correlations remained decreased in depressed patients. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that antidepressant treatment may increase corticolimbic connectivity, thereby possibly increasing the regulatory influence of cortical mood-regulating regions over limbic regions",

These data enabled us to investigate how intrinsic connectivity in health predicts region-by-region vulnerability to disease. For each illness, specific regions emerged as critical network "epicenters" whose normal connectivity profiles most resembled the disease-associated atrophy pattern. Graph theoretical analyses in healthy subjects revealed that regions with higher total connectional flow and, more consistently, shorter functional paths to the epicenters, showed greater disease-related vulnerability. These findings best fit a transneuronal spread model of network-based vulnerability. Molecular pathological approaches may help clarify what makes each epicenter vulnerable to its targeting disease and how toxic protein species travel between networked brain structures},

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: . Robot-assisted training may improve motor function in some hemiparetic patients after stroke, but no physiological predictor of rehabilitation progress is reliable. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) may serve as a method to assess and predict changes in the motor network. OBJECTIVE: . The authors examined the effects of upper-extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation (MANUS) versus an electroencephalography-based brain computer interface setup with motor imagery (MI EEG-BCI) and compared pretreatment and posttreatment RS-fMRI. METHODS: . In all, 9 adults with upper-extremity paresis were trained for 4 weeks with a MANUS shoulder-elbow robotic rehabilitation paradigm. In 3 participants, robot-assisted movement began if no voluntary movement was initiated within 2 s. In 6 participants, MI-BCI-based movement was initiated if motor imagery was detected. RS-fMRI and Fugl-Meyer (FM) upper-extremity motor score were assessed before and after training. RESULTS: . The individual gain in FM scores over 12 weeks could be predicted from functional connectivity changes (FCCs) based on the pre-post differences in RS-fMRI measurements. Both the FM gain and FCC were numerically higher in the MI-BCI group. Increases in FC of the supplementary motor area, the contralesional and ipsilesional motor cortex, and parts of the visuospatial system with mostly association cortex regions and the cerebellum correlated with individual upper-extremity function improvement. CONCLUSION: . FCC may predict the steepness of individual motor gains. Future training could therefore focus on directly inducing these beneficial increases in FC. Evaluation of the treatment groups suggests that MI is a potential facilitator of such neuroplasticity",

    abstract = {The successes of PET and fMRI in non-invasively localizing sensory functions had encouraged efforts to transform the subjective concepts of cognitive psychology into objective physical measures. The assumption was that mental functions could be decomposed into non-overlapping, context-independent modules that are operated on by separable areas of a computer-like brain. The failures of cognitive modularity and of a very localized phrenology are generally, but not universally, accepted; but in their place, and usually not distinguished from the original revolutionary hopes of clarification, experimental results are being interpreted in terms of rather flexible definitions of both cognitive concepts and the degree of localization. In an alternative approach, we have connected fMRI, (13)C MRS, and electrophysiology measurements of brain energy to connect with observable properties of mental life (i.e., awareness). We illustrate this approach with a sensory stimulation experiment; the degree of localization found in BOLD signals was related to the global energy of the brain which, when manipulated by anesthetics, affected the degree of awareness. The influence of brain energy upon functional imaging maps is changing the interpretations of neuroimaging experiments, from psychological concepts generating computer-like responses to empirical responses dominated by the high brain energy and signaling at rest. In our view "baseline" is an operational term, an adjective that defines a property of a state of the system before it is perturbed by a stimulus. Given the dependence of observable psychological properties upon the "baseline" energy, we believe that it is unnecessarily limiting to define a particular state as the baseline.},

We sought to explore genetic influences on brain morphology and function in schizophrenic patients and their relatives.METHODS: Using a multimodal imaging strategy, we studied 33 schizophrenic patients, 55 of their unaffected parents, 30 healthy controls for patients, and 29 healthy controls for parents with voxel-based morphometry of structural MRI scans and functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional MRI data.RESULTS: Schizophrenic patients showed widespread gray matter reductions in the bilateral frontal cortices, bilateral insulae, bilateral occipital cortices, left amygdala and right thalamus, whereas their parents showed more localized reductions in the left amygdala, left thalamus and right orbitofrontal cortex. Patients and their parents shared gray matter loss in the left amygdala. Further investigation of the resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala in the patients showed abnormal functional connectivity with the bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral precunei, bilateral dorsolateral frontal cortices and right insula. Their parents showed slightly less, but similar changes in the pattern in the amygdala connectivity. Co-occurrences of abnormal connectivity of the left amygdala with the left orbitofrontal cortex, right dorsolateral frontal cortex and right precuneus were observed in schizophrenic patients and their parents.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a potential genetic influence on structural and functional abnormalities of the amygdala in schizophrenia. Such information could help future efforts to identify the endophenotypes that characterize the complex disorder of schizophrenia",

However, little is known about the alterations of the interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in patients with MDD. In the present study, we used a newly developed voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method to investigate the interhemispheric FC of the whole brain in patients with MDD at rest. METHODS: Twenty-four first-episode, drug-naive patients with MDD and 24 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy subjects underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An automated VMHC approach was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Patients with MDD showed lower VMHC than healthy subjects in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), two core regions within default mode network (DMN). Both left and right MPFC showed reduced FC with the other frontal areas and with right anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), while PCC/PCu exhibited abnormal FC with the frontal areas and thalamus in patient group. Significant positive correlation was observed between VMHC in MPFC and persistent error response of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST-Pre) in patients. Further ROC analysis revealed that VMHC in the MPFC and PCC/PCu could be used to differentiate the patients from healthy subjects with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest decreased VMHC in brain regions within DMN may underlie the pathogenesis of MDD",

Resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is increasingly being used to study functional interactions between brain regions in both adults and children. We briefly review methods used to study functional interactions and networks with rs-fcMRI and how these methods have been used to define developmental changes in network functional connectivity. The developmental rs-fcMRI studies to date have found two general properties. First, regional interactions change from being predominately anatomically local in children to interactions spanning longer cortical distances in young adults. Second, this developmental change in functional connectivity occurs, in general, via mechanisms of segregation of local regions and integration of distant regions into disparate subnetworks.",

    abstract = "Objectives: To investigate, using resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI), gender-related differences of functional connectivity (FC) and functional network connectivity (FNC) of the human brain. Experimental design: One-hundred and four young healthy subjects (48/56 men/women), aged between 20 and 29 years, underwent a 10-min RS fMRI acquisition. Independent component analysis (ICA) and statistical parametric mapping were used to assess gender-related differences in RSNs, with and without correction for regional gray matter (GM) volume. The relationships among all RSNs was also assessed using a FNC method. Principal observations: For all networks, significant between-group differences of RS activity were found. Between-group comparisons of RSNs changed when adjusting for GM volume, as follows: (1) there was only marginal effect on the analysis of sensory (i.e., sensorimotor, visual, and auditory) networks; and (2) there was a significantly increased difference when cognitive networks (apart from one related to attention) were considered. Compared with women, men experienced increased FC in parietal and occipital regions in most RSNs, whereas women experienced a higher RS FC in frontal and temporal regions, and in the cerebellum. When compared to women, increased FNC was found in men between several cognitive and sensory networks, whereas women showed an increased FNC only between attention and right working-memory networks. Conclusions: The organization of intrinsic FC and FNC differ between genders. The detected differences could contribute to the understanding of the known between-gender variation in task-related recruitments, and the patterns of abnormalities detected in neurologic and psychiatric diseases with a gender prevalence.

Here, we applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) together with behavioral testing to longitudinally assess functional connectivity within neuronal networks, in relation to changes in associated function after unilateral stroke in rats. Our specific goals were (1) to identify temporal alterations in functional connectivity within the bilateral cortical sensorimotor system and (2) to elucidate the relationship between those alterations and changes in sensorimotor function. Our study revealed considerable loss of functional connectivity between ipsilesional and contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex regions, alongside significant sensorimotor function deficits in the first days after stroke. The interhemispheric functional connectivity restored in the following weeks, but remained significantly reduced up to 10 weeks after stroke in animals with lesions that comprised subcortical and cortical tissue, whereas transcallosal neuroanatomical connections were preserved. Intrahemispheric functional connectivity between primary somatosensory and motor cortex areas was preserved in the lesion border zone and moderately enhanced contralesionally. The temporal pattern of changes in functional connectivity between bilateral primary motor and somatosensory cortices correlated significantly with the evolution of sensorimotor function scores. Our study (1) demonstrates that poststroke loss and recovery of sensorimotor function is associated with acute deterioration and subsequent retrieval of interhemispheric functional connectivity within the sensorimotor system and (2) underscores the potential of rs-fMRI to assess spatiotemporal characteristics of functional brain reorganization that may underlie behavioral recovery after brain injury.",

Such confounding effects may introduce correlations and cause an overestimation of functional connectivity strengths. In this study we applied several multidimensional linear regression approaches to remove artificial coherencies and examined the impact of preprocessing on sensitivity and specificity of functional connectivity results in simulated data and resting-state data sets from 40 subjects. Furthermore, we aimed at clarifying possible causes of anticorrelations and test the hypothesis that anticorrelations are introduced via certain preprocessing approaches, with particular focus on the effects of regression against the global signal. Our results show that preprocessing in general greatly increased connection specificity, in particular correction for global signal fluctuations almost doubled connection specificity. However, widespread anticorrelated networks were only found when regression against the global signal was applied. Results in simulated data sets compared with result of human data strongly suggest that anticorrelations are indeed introduced by global signal regression and should therefore be interpreted very carefully. In addition, global signal regression may also reduce the sensitivity for detecting true correlations, i.e. increase the number of false negatives. Concluding from our results we suggest that is highly recommended to apply correction against realignment parameters, white matter and ventricular time courses, as well as the global signal to maximize the specificity of positive resting-state correlations",

However, there is relatively little data informing the developmental nature of this phenomenon. The current case-control study examined the DMN in a unique prospective sample of school-age children with a previous history of preschool depression. Methods: DMN functional connectivity was assessed using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data and the posterior cingulate (PCC) as a seed region of interest. Thirty-nine medication na\"{\i}ve school age children (21 with a history of preschool depression and 18 healthy peers) and their families who were ascertained as preschoolers and prospectively assessed over at least 4 annual waves as part of a federally funded study of preschool depression were included. Results: Decreased connectivity between the PCC and regions within the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum was found in children with known depression during the preschool period. Increased connectivity between the PCC and regions within the subgenual and anterior cingulate cortices and anterior MTG bilaterally was also found in these children. Additionally, a clinically relevant 'brain-behavior' relationship between atypical functional connectivity of the PCC and disruptions in emotion regulation was identified. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the DMN in children known to have experienced the onset of a clinically significant depressive syndrome during preschool. Results suggest that a history of preschool depression is associated with atypical DMN connectivity. However, longitudinal studies are needed to clarify whether the current findings of atypical DMN connectivity are a precursor or a consequence of preschool depression},

    abstract = "Recent studies suggest that memory formation in the hippocampus is modulated by the motivational significance of events, allowing past experience to adaptively guide behavior. The effects of motivation on memory are thought to depend on interactions between the hippocampus, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Indeed, animal studies reveal anatomical pathways for circuit-level interaction between these regions. However, a homologue circuit connectivity in humans remains to be shown. We characterized this circuitry in humans by exploiting spontaneous low-frequency modulations in the fMRI signal (termed resting-state functional connectivity), which are thought to reflect functionally related regions and their organization into functional networks in the brain. We examined connectivity in this network across two datasets (hi-resolution, n = 100; standard resolution, n = 894). Results reveal convergent connectivity between the hippocampus, and both the NAcc and the VTA centered on ventral regions in the body of the hippocampus. Additionally, we found individual differences in the strength of connectivity within this network. Together, these results provide a novel task-independent characterization of circuitry underlying interactions between the hippocampus, NAcc, and VTA and provide a framework with which to understand how connectivity might reflect and constrain the effects of motivation on memory. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

    abstract = "Temporal blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast signals in functional MRI during rest may be characterized by power spectral distribution (PSD) trends of the form 1/f(alpha). Trends with 1/f characteristics comprise fractal properties with repeating oscillation patterns in multiple time scales. Estimates of the fractal properties enable the quantification of phenomena that may otherwise be difficult to measure, such as transient, non-linear changes. In this study it was hypothesized that the fractal metrics of 1/f BOLD signal trends can map changes related to dynamic, multi-scale alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after a transient hyperventilation challenge. Twenty-three normal adults were imaged in a resting-state before and after hyperventilation. Different variables (1/f trend constant alpha, fractal dimension D(f), and, Hurst exponent H) characterizing the trends were measured from BOLD signals. The results show that fractal metrics of the BOLD signal follow the fractional Gaussian noise model, even during the dynamic CBF change that follows hyperventilation. The most dominant effect on the fractal metrics was detected in grey matter, in line with previous hyperventilation vaso-reactivity studies. The alpha was able to differentiate also blood vessels from grey matter changes. D(f) was most sensitive to grey matter. H correlated with default mode network areas before hyperventilation but this pattern vanished after hyperventilation due to a global increase in H. In the future, resting-state fMRI combined with fractal metrics of the BOLD signal may be used for analyzing multi-scale alterations of cerebral blood flow",

These regions are constituents of brain networks thought to be involved in drug addiction. To investigate whether networks containing these regions differ between nicotine dependent female smokers and age-matched female non-smokers, we employed functional MRI (fMRI) at rest. METHODS: Data were processed with independent component analysis (ICA) to identify resting state networks (RSNs). We identified a subcortical limbic network and three discrete PFC networks: a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) network and right and left lateralized fronto-parietal networks common to all subjects. We then compared these RSNs between smokers and non-smokers using a dual regression approach. RESULTS: Smokers had greater coupling versus non-smokers between left fronto-parietal and mPFC networks. Smokers with the greatest mPFC-left fronto-parietal coupling had the most DS smoking cue reactivity as measured during an fMRI smoking cue reactivity paradigm. This may be important because the DS plays a critical role in maintaining drug-cue associations. Furthermore, subcortical limbic network amplitude was greater in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prefrontal brain networks are more strongly coupled in smokers, which could facilitate drug-cue responding. Our data also are the first to document greater reward-related network fMRI amplitude in smokers. Our findings suggest that resting state PFC network interactions and limbic network amplitude can differentiate nicotine-dependent smokers from controls, and may serve as biomarkers for nicotine dependence severity and treatment efficacy",

Patients with AD typically exhibit disruptions in the default mode network (DMN). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a family history of late onset AD on DMN integrity in cognitively normal individuals. In particular, we determined whether a family history effect is detectable in apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\epsilon$4 allele noncarriers.METHODS: We studied a cohort of 348 cognitively normal participants with or without family history of late onset AD. DMN integrity was assessed by resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging.RESULTS: A family history of late onset AD was associated with reduced resting state functional connectivity between particular nodes of the DMN, namely the posterior cingulate and medial temporal cortex. The observed functional connectivity reduction was not attributable to medial temporal structural atrophy. Importantly, we detected a family history effect on DMN functional connectivity in APOE $\epsilon$4 allele noncarriers.INTERPRETATION: Unknown genetic factors, embodied in a family history of late onset AD, may affect DMN integrity prior to cognitive impairment.

    title = "{Interaction between dysfunctional connectivity at rest and heroin cues-induced brain responses in male abstinent heroin-dependent individuals.}",
    abstract = "BACKGROUND: The majority of previous heroin cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies focused on local function impairments, such as inhibitory control, decision-making and stress regulation. Our previous studies have demonstrated that these brain circuits also presented dysfunctional connectivity during the resting state. Yet few studies considered the relevance of resting state dysfunctional connectivity to task-related neural activity in the same chronic heroin user (CHU).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We employed the method of graph theory analysis, which detected the abnormality of brain regions and dysregulation of brain connections at rest between 16 male abstinent chronic heroin users (CHUs) and 16 non-drug users (NDUs). Using a cue-reactivity task, we assessed the relationship between drug-related cue-induced craving activity and the abnormal topological properties of the CHUs' resting networks. Comparing NDUs' brain activity to that of CHUs, the intensity of functional connectivity of the medial frontal gyrus (meFG) in patients' resting state networks was prominently greater and positively correlated with the same region's neural activity in the heroin-related task; decreased functional connectivity intensity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in CHUs at rest was associated with more drug-related cue-induced craving activities.CONCLUSIONS: These results may indicate that there exist two brain systems interacting simultaneously in the heroin-addicted brain with regards to a cue-reactivity task. The current study may shed further light on the neural architecture that supports craving responses in heroin dependence.",

    abstract = {This study examined how the mutual interactions of functionally integrated neural networks during resting-state fMRI differed between adolescence and adulthood. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify functionally connected neural networks in 100 healthy participants aged 12-30 years. Hemodynamic timecourses that represented integrated neural network activity were analyzed with tools that quantified system "causal density" estimates, which indexed the proportion of significant Granger causality relationships among system nodes. Mutual influences among networks decreased with age, likely reflecting stronger within-network connectivity and more efficient between-network influences with greater development. Supplemental tests showed that this normative age-related reduction in causal density was accompanied by fewer significant connections to and from each network, regional increases in the strength of functional integration within networks, and age-related reductions in the strength of numerous specific system interactions. The latter included paths between lateral prefrontal-parietal circuits and "default mode" networks. These results contribute to an emerging understanding that activity in widely distributed networks thought to underlie complex cognition influences activity in other networks},

    abstract = "Confounding low-frequency fluctuation (LFF) physiological noise is a concern for functional connectivity analyses in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using estimates of LFF physiological noise derived from measured cardiac and respiration signals, noise can be filtered from the time series thus improving the results of functional connectivity analysis. The ability of spatial independent component analysis (ICA) to separate LFF physiological noise from the default mode network (DMN), which overlap each other spatially and occur at similar frequencies, has remained an open question. We aimed to define the net effect of physiological correction for spatial ICA DMN detection at 1.5 T by statistically testing obtained ICASSO centrotype DMN maps before and after physiological correction. Comparisons with 21 subjects were performed for ICA model orders 20, 30 and 40 and no statistically significant spatial difference was found after physiological correction, although slight DMN reduction in precuneus or sagittal sinus was detected in all dimensionalities. A confounding factor in the analysis is the susceptibility of the ICA decomposition for data changes yielding different DMN splitting between and after physiological correction conditions without comparable true change in the data. This issue is mitigated at higher ICA model orders. The results suggest that subject-level DMN can for some subjects be optimized by physiological correction, but on the group-level this contribution is minor.",

    abstract = "The resting brain has been extensively investigated for low frequency synchrony between brain regions, namely Functional Connectivity (FC). However the other main stream of brain connectivity analysis that seeks causal interactions between brain regions, Effective Connectivity (EC), has been little explored. Inherent complexity of brain activities in resting-state, as observed in BOLD (Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependant) fluctuations, calls for exploratory methods for characterizing these causal networks. On the other hand, the inevitable effects that hemodynamic system imposes on causal inferences in fMRI data, lead us toward the methods in which causal inferences can take place in latent neuronal level, rather than observed BOLD time-series. To simultaneously satisfy these two concerns, in this paper, we introduce a novel state-space system identification approach for studying causal interactions among brain regions in the absence of explicit cognitive task. This algorithm is a geometrically inspired method for identification of stochastic systems, purely based on output observations. Using extensive simulations, three aspects of our proposed method are investigated: ability in discriminating existent interactions from non-existent ones, the effect of observation noise, and downsampling on algorithm performance. Our simulations demonstrate that Subspace-based Identification Algorithm (SIA) is sufficiently robust against above-mentioned factors, and can reliably uncover the underlying causal interactions of resting-state fMRI. Furthermore, in contrast to previously established state-space approaches in Effective Connectivity studies, this method is able to characterize causal networks with large number of brain regions. In addition, we utilized the proposed algorithm for identification of causal relationships underlying anti-correlation of default-mode and Dorsal Attention Networks during the rest, using fMRI. We observed that Default-Mode Network places in a higher order in hierarchical structure of brain functional networks compared to Dorsal Attention Networks",

Little is known, so far, about the exact neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms of aberrant cognition function in this disease.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate how the brain function is changed in MHE, we applied a resting-state fMRI approach with independent component analysis (ICA) to assess the differences of resting-state networks (RSNs) between MHE patients and healthy controls. Fourteen MHE patients and 14 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects underwent resting-state fMRI scans. ICA was used to identify six RSNs [dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), auditory network (AN), sensorimotor network (SMN), self-referential network (SRN)] in each subject. Group maps of each RSN were compared between the MHE and healthy control groups. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the RSNs functional connectivity (FC) and venous blood ammonia levels, and neuropsychological tests scores for all patients. Compared with the healthy controls, MHE patients showed significantly decreased FC in DAN, both decreased and increased FC in DMN, AN and VN. No significant differences were found in SRN and SMN between two groups. A relationship between FC and blood ammonia levels/neuropsychological tests scores were found in specific regions of RSNs, including middle and medial frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MHE patients have selective impairments of RSNs intrinsic functional connectivity, with aberrant functional connectivity in DAN, DMN, VN, AN, and spared SMN and SRN. Our fMRI study might supply a novel way to understand the neuropathophysiological mechanism of cognition function changes in MHE",

Previous multimodal imaging studies have consistently demonstrated that the topological architecture of the brain network is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the topological properties of brain alterations in AD. One potential explanation for these inconsistent results lies with the diverse homogeneity and distinct progressive stages of the AD involved in these studies, which are thought to be critical factors that might affect the results. We investigated the topological properties of brain functional networks derived from resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of carefully selected moderate AD patients and normal controls (NCs). Our results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in AD patients, which showing increased local efficiency but decreased global efficiency. We found that the altered brain regions are mainly located in the default mode network, the temporal lobe and certain subcortical regions that are closely associated with the neuropathological changes in AD. Of note, our exploratory study revealed that the ApoE genotype modulates brain network properties, especially in AD patients",

AIMS: To review the rationale behind proposed disordered brain network function in bipolar disorder and the evidence of network dysfunction from imaging studies together with an overview of more novel techniques pertinent to this field. METHODS: Medline databases were searched using the terms bipolar disorder, imaging, connectivity and brain networks. Relevant articles were reviewed and bibliographic cross-referencing was used to focus on key areas of interest, supplemented by additional Medline searches as required. RESULTS: Structural and functional imaging studies support the concept of brain network dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Novel techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and resting state network analysis can assess such dysfunction more directly, but there are few studies specific to bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Brain network dysfunction is a useful framework for considering the varied presentations of bipolar disorder. Advanced imaging techniques are increasingly available, with the potential to provide insights into this important area.",

There is a lack of knowledge about the effect of increasing model order on independent components' (ICs) characteristics of resting state networks (RSNs). Probabilistic group ICA (group PICA) of 55 healthy control subjects resting state data was repeated 100 times using ICASSO repeatability software and after clustering of components, centrotype components were used for further analysis. Visual signal sources (VSS), default mode network (DMN), primary somatosensory (S(1)), secondary somatosensory (S(2)), primary motor cortex (M(1)), striatum, and precuneus (preC) components were chosen as components of interest to be evaluated by varying group probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) model order between 10 and 200. At model order 10, DMN and VSS components fuse several functionally separate sources that at higher model orders branch into multiple components. Both volume and mean z-score of components of interest showed significant (P < 0.05) changes as a function of model order. In conclusion, model order has a significant effect on ICs characteristics. Our findings suggest that using model orders < or =20 provides a general picture of large scale brain networks. However, detection of some components (i.e., S(1), S(2), and striatum) requires higher model order estimation. Model orders 30-40 showed spatial overlapping of some IC sources. Model orders 70 +/- 10 offer a more detailed evaluation of RSNs in a group PICA setting.

Signals common for both states are typically not revealed. Previous motor learning studies have shown that extensive motor skill training can induce profound changes in regional activity in both task and control states. To address the issue of brain activity changes in the resting-state, we explored long-term motor training induced neuronal and physiological changes in normal human subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Ten healthy subjects performed a finger movement task daily for four weeks, during which three sessions of fMRI images and two sessions of PET images were acquired. Using a classical data analysis strategy, we found that the brain activation increased first and then returned to the pre-training, replicating previous findings. Interestingly, we also observed that motor skill training induced significant increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in both task and resting states as the practice progressed. The apparent decrease in activation may actually result from a greater increase in activity in the resting state, rather than a decrease in the task state. By showing that training can affect the resting state, our findings have profound implications for the interpretation of functional activations in neuroimaging studies. Combining changes in resting state with activation data should greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of motor-skill learning.",

The robustness of this method was tested in 979 subjects from a large repository of MRI time series collected in resting conditions. Consistently across research sites, a region located in the posterior cingulate/ventral precuneus (BA 23/31) was the area with the highest lFCD, which suggest that this is the most prominent functional hub in the brain. In addition, regions located in the inferior parietal cortex (BA 18) and cuneus (BA 18) had high lFCD. The variability of this pattern across subjects was <36\% and within subjects was 12\%. The power scaling of the lFCD was consistent across research centers, suggesting that that brain networks have a "scale-free" organization},

Confirming earlier findings, three subjects showed a negative correlation between the BOLD signal and the average power time series within the alpha band (8--12 Hz) in extensive areas of the occipital, parietal and frontal lobes. In small thalamic areas, the BOLD signal was positively correlated with the alpha power. For subjects 3 and 4, who displayed two different states during the data acquisition time, it was shown that the corresponding correlation patterns were different, thus demonstrating the state dependency of the results. In subject 5, the changes in BOLD were observed mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes. Subject 6 only showed positive correlations, thus contradicting the negative BOLD alpha power cortical correlations that were found in most subjects. Results suggest that the resting state varies over subjects and, sometimes, even within one subject.

In this study, functional connectivity was investigated as a means for predicting surgical outcome from the preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of epilepsy patients. Methods: Resting-state simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)-fMRI data were collected from 18 patients with intractable epilepsy before surgery and from 14 healthy subjects. For each patient, EEG-spike correlated fMRI analysis was performed and an activation cluster that overlapped the most with the planned resection area for each patient was chosen as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. After the functional connectivity maps were computed, laterality indices of functional connectivity were contrasted between patients who had seizures after surgeries (seizure-recurrence group) and those who did not have them for at least a year (seizure-free group). Key Findings: Patients in the seizure-recurrence group had less-lateralized functional connectivity than patients in the seizure-free group (t(16) = 2.3, after control subtracted and Fisher transformed, p < 0.05, two-tailed). Significance: This study suggests the potential for using preoperative fMRI connectivity analysis as a predictive outcome measure. If confirmed by further research, a high laterality will be an important addition to the other predictors of better surgical outcome such as febrile seizures, mesial temporal sclerosis, tumors, abnormal MRI, and EEG/MRI concordance.",

    abstract = "We assessed abnormalities within the principal brain resting state networks (RSNs) in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) to define whether functional abnormalities in this disease are limited to the visual system or, conversely, tend to be more diffuse. We also defined the structural substrates of fMRI changes using a connectivity-based analysis of diffusion tensor (DT) MRI data. Neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, DT MRI and RS fMRI data were acquired from 13 LHON patients and 13 healthy controls. RS fMRI data were analyzed using independent component analysis and SPM5. A DT MRI connectivity-based parcellation analysis was performed using the primary visual and auditory cortices, bilaterally, as seed regions. Compared to controls, LHON patients had a significant increase of RS fluctuations in the primary visual and auditory cortices, bilaterally. They also showed decreased RS fluctuations in the right lateral occipital cortex and right temporal occipital fusiform cortex. Abnormalities of RS fluctuations were correlated significantly with retinal damage and disease duration. The DT MRI connectivity-based parcellation identified a higher number of clusters in the right auditory cortex in LHON vs. controls. Differences of cluster-centroid profiles were found between the two groups for all the four seeds analyzed. For three of these areas, a correspondence was found between abnormalities of functional and structural connectivities. These results suggest that functional and structural abnormalities extend beyond the visual network in LHON patients. Such abnormalities also involve the auditory network, thus corroborating the notion of a cross-modal plasticity between these sensory modalities in patients with severe visual deficits.",

    abstract = {To better understand intrinsic brain connections in major depression, we used a neuroimaging technique that measures resting state functional connectivity using functional MRI (fMRI). Three different brain networks--the cognitive control network, default mode network, and affective network--were investigated. Compared with controls, in depressed subjects each of these three networks had increased connectivity to the same bilateral dorsal medial prefrontal cortex region, an area that we term the dorsal nexus. The dorsal nexus demonstrated dramatically increased depression-associated fMRI connectivity with large portions of each of the three networks. The discovery that these regions are linked together through the dorsal nexus provides a potential mechanism to explain how symptoms of major depression thought to arise in distinct networks--decreased ability to focus on cognitive tasks, rumination, excessive self-focus, increased vigilance, and emotional, visceral, and autonomic dysregulation--could occur concurrently and behave synergistically. It suggests that the newly identified dorsal nexus plays a critical role in depressive symptomatology, in effect "hot wiring" networks together; it further suggests that reducing increased connectivity of the dorsal nexus presents a potential therapeutic target.},

With the use of independent component analysis (ICA) of each individual fMRI signal and classification of the ICA-defined components across subjects, a set of 23 resting-state networks (RNs) was identified. Functional connectivity between each pair of RNs was assessed using temporal correlation analyses in the 0.01- to 0.1-Hz frequency band, and the corresponding set of correlation coefficients was used to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the 23 RNs. At the highest hierarchical level, we found two anticorrelated systems in charge of intrinsic and extrinsic processing, respectively. At a lower level, the intrinsic system appears to be partitioned in three modules that subserve generation of spontaneous thoughts (M1a; default mode), inner maintenance and manipulation of information (M1b), and cognitive control and switching activity (M1c), respectively. The extrinsic system was found to be made of two distinct modules: one including primary somatosensory and auditory areas and the dorsal attentional network (M2a) and the other encompassing the visual areas (M2b). Functional connectivity analyses revealed that M1b played a central role in the functioning of the intrinsic system, whereas M1c seems to mediate exchange of information between the intrinsic and extrinsic systems.",

    abstract = "A dramatic increase in the use and dependence of prescription opioids has occurred within the last 10 years. The consequences of long-term prescription opioid use and dependence on the brain are largely unknown, and any speculation is inferred from heroin and methadone studies. Thus, no data have directly demonstrated the effects of prescription opioid use on brain structure and function in humans. To pursue this issue, we used structural magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a highly enriched group of prescription opioid-dependent patients [(n=10); from a larger study on prescription opioid dependent patients (n=133)] and matched healthy individuals (n=10) to characterize possible brain alterations that may be caused by long-term prescription opioid use. Criteria for patient selection included: (i) no dependence on alcohol or other drugs; (ii) no comorbid psychiatric or neurological disease; and (iii) no medical conditions, including pain. In comparison to control subjects, individuals with opioid dependence displayed bilateral volumetric loss in the amygdala. Prescription opioid-dependent subjects had significantly decreased anisotropy in axonal pathways specific to the amygdala (i.e. stria terminalis, ventral amygdalofugal pathway and uncinate fasciculus) as well as the internal and external capsules. In the patient group, significant decreases in functional connectivity were observed for seed regions that included the anterior insula, nucleus accumbens and amygdala subdivisions. Correlation analyses revealed that longer duration of prescription opioid exposure was associated with greater changes in functional connectivity. Finally, changes in amygdala functional connectivity were observed to have a significant dependence on amygdala volume and white matter anisotropy of efferent and afferent pathways of the amygdala. These findings suggest that prescription opioid dependence is associated with structural and functional changes in brain regions implicated in the regulation of affect and impulse control, as well as in reward and motivational functions. These results may have important clinical implications for uncovering the effects of long-term prescription opioid use on brain structure and function.",

However, the effect of antidepressant treatment on functional connectivity within the DMN has yet to be established. Considering the very high rates of relapse in recovered subjects, we hypothesized that abnormalities in DMN functional connectivity would persist in recovered MDD subjects. METHODS: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging images were collected from 24 MDD patients and 29 healthy control subjects. After 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment, 18 recovered MDD subjects were scanned again. Group independent component analysis was performed to decompose the resting state images into spatially independent components. Default mode subnetworks were identified using a template based on previous studies. Group differences in the ensuing subnetworks were tested using two-sample t tests. RESULTS: Two spatially independent default mode subnetworks were detected in all subjects: the anterior subnetwork and the posterior subnetwork. Both subnetworks showed increased functional connectivity in pretreatment MDD subjects, relative to control subjects. Differences in the posterior subnetwork were normalized after antidepressant treatment, while abnormal functional connectivity persisted within the anterior subnetwork. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a dissociation of the DMN into subnetworks, where persistent abnormal functional connectivity within the anterior subnetwork in recovered MDD subjects may constitute a biomarker of asymptomatic depression and potential for relapse",

Drawing on the genetics literature, early work in neuroimaging considered actionability to be a driving force for determining if and when findings should be disclosed to individuals in whom they are detected, as inherent uncertainty raises potential ethical dilemmas of misdiagnosing and mislabelling people as patients. Here we consider the possibility of incidental findings in brain function during the resting state. Our approach does not anchor the resting state as the sine qua non of functional incidental findings, but as a path to thinking about where they may emerge in the future and how our professional communities need to think about thinking about them. We suggest that considering the issues proactively today, within a framework that is maximally flexible and open to modification, is better than responding reactively after the fact and with no framework at all. We argue that there is a duty to consider possible incidental findings despite the ambiguities of data interpretation, while working hard to prevent unnecessary alarm",

    abstract = "It has recently become clear that alcohol addiction might be related to a brain dysfunction, in which a genetic background and environmental factors shape brain mechanisms involved with alcohol consumption. Craving, a major component determining relapses in alcohol abuse has been linked to abnormal activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (dACC) and amygdala. We report the results of a patient who underwent rTMS targeting the dACC using a double cone coil in an attempt to suppress very severe intractable alcohol craving. Functional imaging studies consisting of fMRI and resting state EEG were performed before rTMS, after successful rTMS and after unsuccessful rTMS with relapse. Craving was associated with EEG beta activity and connectivity between the dACC and PCC in the patient in comparison to a healthy population, which disappeared after successful rTMS. Cue induced worsening of craving pre-rTMS activated the ACC-vmPFC and PCC on fMRI, as well as the nucleus accumbens area, and lateral frontoparietal areas. The nucleus accumbens, ACC-vmPFC and PCC activation disappeared on fMRI following successful rTMS. Relapse was associated with recurrence of ACC and PCC EEG activity, but in gamma band, in comparison to a healthy population. On fMRI nucleus accumbens, ACC and PCC activation returned to the initial activation pattern. A pathophysiological approach is described to suppress alcohol craving temporarily by rTMS directed at the anterior cingulate. Linking functional imaging changes to craving intensity suggests this approach warrants further exploration.",

The masking method and the orthogonalization method performed better from this perspective but are both restricted to certain experimental conditions. Based on the results of these simulations, we offer practical guidelines for the choice of global normalization method least likely to bias the experimental results.",

Residuals calculated from the GEE models are used to correlate brain regions and assess between group differences. The standard pooling approach of group averages of the Fisher-z transformation assuming temporal independence is a typical approach used to compare group correlations. The GEE approaches and standard Fisher-z pooling approach are demonstrated with an Alzheimer's disease (AD) connectivity study in a population of AD subjects and healthy control subjects.

However, it is still unclear whether the connectivity of the IPC is impaired in MCI patients. In the present study, resting state fMRI was applied to examine the functional connectivity of the three subdivisions of the IPC in MCI patients after controlling the impact of regional grey matter atrophy. It was found that, using IPS, AG, and SG as seeds of functional connectivity, three canonical functional networks could be correspondingly traced, i.e., executive control network (ECN), default mode network (DMN), and salience network (SN), and the three networks are differently altered in MCI patients. In contrast to the healthy controls, it was found that in MCI patients: 1) AG connectivity was significantly reduced within the DMN; 2) IPS showed decreased connectivity with the right inferior frontal gyrus while increased connectivity with the left frontal regions within the ECN; and 3) SG displayed decreased connectivity with a distribution of regions including the frontal and parietal regions, with increased connectivity with some sub-cortical areas within the SN. Moreover, the connectivity within the three networks was correlated with episodic memory and general cognitive impairment in MCI patients. These results extend well beyond the DMN, and further suggest that MCI is associated with alteration of large-scale functional brain networks",

    abstract = "Resting state brain activity, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of stimulation, is widely investigated in clinical, pharmacological, developmental and cross-species neuroscience research. However, despite the general and broad interest in understating the nature of resting state networks (RSNs), there has not been a thorough investigation into the relationship between these functional networks and their adherence to underling brain anatomy. We acquired resting state fMRI data from 10 subjects and extracted individual and group RSN maps respectively using independent component analysis (ICA) and self organising group-level ICA (sogICA). Cortex based alignment (CBA), an advanced surface based alignment technique which uses individual curvature information to align individual subjects' brains to a dynamic group average, was used to maximise anatomical correspondence across subjects. Cross subject spatial correlations of the RSN maps (independent components) were carried out with and without CBA. Seven RSNs, which are amongst the most reported and studied networks, were identified. We observed a systematic gain in the spatial correlation in all of them following CBA, although this gain was not uniform across RSNs. The observed increase in similarity of the functional RSNs after anatomical alignment illustrates that these functional networks are indeed related to underlying macroanatomical features. Moreover, our results demonstrate that by correcting for individual anatomical differences, advanced surface based alignment techniques increase the overlap of corresponding resting state networks across subjects, thereby providing a useful means to improve resting state group statistics with no need for substantial smoothing.

    abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Limited controlled data exist to guide treatment choices for clinicians caring for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Although many putative predictors of treatment response have been reported, most were identified through retrospective analyses of existing datasets and very few have been replicated in a manner that can impact clinical practice. One major confound in previous studies examining predictors of treatment response is the patient's treatment history, which may affect both the predictor of interest and treatment outcomes. Moreover, prior treatment history provides an important source of selection bias, thereby limiting generalizability. Consequently, we initiated a randomized clinical trial designed to identify factors that moderate response to three treatments for MDD among patients never treated previously for the condition. METHODS: Treatment-naive adults aged 18-65 years with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic MDD are randomized equally to one of three 12-week treatment arms: 1) cognitive behavior therapy (CBT, 16 sessions), 2) duloxetine (30-60 mg/d), or 3) escitalopram (10-20 mg/d). Prior to randomization, patients undergo multiple assessments, including resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), immune markers, DNA and gene expression products, and dexamethasone-corticotropin releasing hormone (Dex/CRH) testing. Prior to or shortly after randomization, patients also complete a comprehensive personality assessment. Repeat assessment of the biological measures (fMRI, immune markers, and gene expression products) occur at an early time-point in treatment, and upon completion of 12-week treatment, when a a second Dex/CRH test is also conducted, Patients remitting by the end of this acute treatment phase are then eligible to enter a 21-month follow-up phase, with quarterly visits to monitor for recurrence. Non-remitters are offered augmentation treatment for a second 12-week course of treatment, during which they receive a combination of CBT and antidepressant medication. Predictors of the primary outcome, remission, will be identified for overall and treatment-specific effects, and a statistical model incorporating multiple predictors will be developed to predict outcomes. DISCUSSION: The PReDICT study's evaluation of biological, psychological, and clinical factors that may differentially impact treatment outcomes represents a sizeable step toward developing personalized treatments for MDD. Identified predictors should help guide the selection of initial treatments, and identify those patients most vulnerable to recurrence, who thus warrant maintenance or combination treatments to achieve and maintain wellness",

    abstract = {The mature human brain is organized into a collection of specialized functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions. Studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks. In this report, we combine resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI), graph analysis, community detection, and spring-embedding visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined in earlier studies. As we have previously reported, we find, across development, a trend toward 'segregation' (a general decrease in correlation strength) between regions close in anatomical space and 'integration' (an increased correlation strength) between selected regions distant in space. The generalization of these earlier trends across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend to large-scale graph theoretic analyses of large-scale brain networks. Communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical proximity, while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional relationships, as defined from adult fMRI studies. In sum, over development, the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local anatomical emphasis in children to a more "distributed" architecture in young adults. We argue that this "local to distributed" developmental characterization has important implications for understanding the development of neural systems underlying cognition. Further, graph metrics (e.g., clustering coefficients and average path lengths) are similar in child and adult graphs, with both showing "small-world"-like properties, while community detection by modularity optimization reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different between young children and young adults. These observations suggest that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems in divergent ways.},

    abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Few studies have been previously published about the resting state brain activity in young chronic smokers, although many previous fMRI studies have shown that the task-related activity pattern is altered in chronic smokers. METHODS: In the present study, forty-five healthy smokers (age: 27.9 [PLUS-MINUS SIGN] 5.6 year) and forty-four healthy non-smoking control subjects (age: 26.3 [PLUS-MINUS SIGN] 5.8 year) have been imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and analyzed with the regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, decreased ReHo was found in smokers in the right inferior frontal cortex and increased ReHo was found in the left superior parietal lobe (P < 0.01, 35 Voxels,Alphasim corrected). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that, during resting state, neural function is less synchronized in the right inferior frontal cortex and more synchronized in the left superior parietal lobe in chronic smokers compared to non-smokers. The decreased synchronization in the right inferior frontal cortex may reflect lacking of control over reward-related behavior, and the increased synchronization may reflect smoking urges",

    abstract = "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by progressive cognitive and intellectual deficits. Most patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are thought to be in a very early stage of AD. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reflects spontaneous brain activities and/or the endogenous/background neurophysiological process of the human brain. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) can provide a fast method for mapping regional activity across the whole brain. Little has been previously published about where or how spontaneous activity differs between MCI and AD, although many previous fMRI studies have shown that the activity pattern is altered in MCI/AD. In the present study, we first used the ReHo method to explore differences in regional spontaneous activities throughout the whole brain between normal controls (NC) and people with MCI and with AD. A one-way ANOVA was performed to determine the regions in which the ReHo differs between the three groups, and then a post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate differences in the pattern among the three groups. Finally a correlation analysis was done between the ReHo index of these regions and clinical variables in order to evaluate the relationship between ReHo and cognitive measures in the AD and MCI groups. An exploratory classification analysis also demonstrated that ReHo measures were able to correctly separate subjects in 71.4\% of the cases. Altered brain spontaneous activations were found in the medial prefrontal cortex, the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in both MCI and AD. In MCI, the ReHo index in the left IPL was higher than that of the NC, which could indicate the presence of a compensatory mechanism in MCI. More obviously, the correlation analysis indicated that the lower the memory and other cognitive abilities, the lower the ReHo in patients with MCI and AD. Combining our findings with the results in earlier studies, we propose that the spontaneous activity pattern in the resting state could potentially be used as a clinical marker for MCI/AD",

Such physiological noise can obscure the detection of neural activation using fMRI, and it is therefore important to model and remove the effects of this noise. While a hemodynamic response function relating respiratory variation (RV) and the BOLD signal has been described [Birn, R.M., Smith, M.A., Jones, T.B., Bandettini, P.A., 2008b.

Neuroimage 40, 644-654.], no such mapping for heart rate (HR) has been proposed. In the current study, the effects of RV and HR are simultaneously deconvolved from resting state fMRI. It is demonstrated that a convolution model including RV and HR can explain significantly more variance in gray matter BOLD signal than a model that includes RV alone, and an average HR response function is proposed that well characterizes our subject population. It is observed that the voxel-wise morphology of the deconvolved RV responses is preserved when HR is included in the model, and that its form is adequately modeled by Birn et al.'s previously-described respiration response function. Furthermore, it is shown that modeling out RV and HR can significantly alter functional connectivity maps of the default-mode network",

Two silver filiform needles were separately inserted into Guanyuan (OV 4) or Zhongwan (CV 12), and manipulated with uniform reducing-reinforcing method to induce "Deqi". fMRI scan was performed before needling, during needle retention, EA stimulation, and post-EA. Data of fMRI was analyzed by using software SPM 2. The volunteer subjective needling sensations were recorded. The activation, deactivation, short-distance and long-distance functional connectivity maps of different cerebral regions were analyzed by using whole brain correlation analysis.RESULTS: Comparison between the two acupoints showed that fullness feeling was stronger in CV 4 than in CV 12. EA at CV 4 and CV 12 induced a similar stronger and prevalent deactivation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulated cortex (ACO). The deactivation of the ACC was stronger in the CV 4 group than in the CV 12 group. The default BOLD mode of the brain at rest was modified by needle retention and EA, respectively. The short-distance functional connection brain network was significantly changed after EA. Interestingly, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and anteroinferior portion of the anterior cingulate cortex in the limbic-paralimbic-neocortical network (LPNN) were involved in the instant post-effects of EA. Relatively smaller differences in the brain functional activity and short-distance functional connectivity were found between these two acupoints.CONCLUSION: EA of CV 4 and CV 12 can modulate short-distance functional connectivity of the LPNN, and have fewer differences in inducing needling sensation and deactivation of ACC, etc},

    abstract = "Various lines of (pre)clinical research indicate that cannabinoid agents carry the potential for therapeutic application to reduce symptoms in several psychiatric disorders. However, direct testing of the involvement of cannabinoid brain systems in psychiatric syndromes is essential for further development. In the Pharmacological Imaging of the Cannabinoid System (PhICS) study, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in cognitive brain function is assessed by comparing acute effects of the cannabinoid agonist $\Delta$9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain function between healthy controls and groups of psychiatric patients showing cognitive dysfunction. This article describes the objectives and methods of the PhICS study and presents preliminary results of the administration procedure on subjective and neurophysiological parameters. Core elements in the methodology of PhICS are the administration method (THC is administered by inhalation using a vaporizing device) and a comprehensive use of pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) combining several types of MRI scans including functional MRI (fMRI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) to measure brain perfusion, and resting-state fMRI. Additional methods like neuropsychological testing further specify the exact role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating cognition. Preliminary results presented in this paper indicate robust behavioral and subjective effects of THC. In addition, fMRI paradigms demonstrate activation of expected networks of brain regions in the cognitive domains of interest. The presented administration and assessment protocol provides a basis for further research on the involvement of the endocannabionoid systems in behavior and in psychopathology, which in turn may lead to development of therapeutic opportunities of cannabinoid ligands.",

The role of this resting state activity, evident as low-frequency fluctuations of BOLD (see [1] for review, [2-4]) or electrical [5, 6] signals, is unclear. Two major proposals are that resting state activity supports introspective thought or supports responses to future events [7]. An alternative perspective is that the resting brain actively and selectively processes previous experiences [8]. Here we show that motor learning can modulate subsequent activity within resting networks. BOLD signal was recorded during rest periods before and after an 11 min visuomotor training session. Motor learning but not motor performance modulated a fronto-parietal resting state network (RSN). Along with the fronto-parietal network, a cerebellar network not previously reported as an RSN was also specifically altered by learning. Both of these networks are engaged during learning of similar visuomotor tasks [9-22]. Thus, we provide the first description of the modulation of specific RSNs by prior learning--but not by prior performance--revealing a novel connection between the neuroplastic mechanisms of learning and resting state activity. Our approach may provide a powerful tool for exploration of the systems involved in memory consolidation.",

MRI data acquisition was performed on a SIEMENS verio 3-Tesla scanner. The fMRI study used a single block experimental design. We first acquired the baseline resting state data in the initial 3 minutes; we then acquired the fMRI data during the procession of acupuncture stimulation on the acupoints of Tai chong and Hegu for the following 3 minutes. Last, we acquired fMRI data for another 10 minutes after the needle was withdrawn. The preprocessing and data analysis were performed using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software. Then the two-sample t-tests were performed between each two groups of different states. We found that during the resting state, brain activities in AD and MCI patients were different from those of control subjects. During the acupuncture and the second resting state after acupuncture, when comparing to resting state, there are several regions showing increased or decreased activities in MCI, AD subjects compared to normal subjects. Most of the regions were involved in the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe, which were closely related to the memory and cognition. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of acupuncture in AD and MCI patients by combing fMRI and traditional acupuncture.

Due to the sustained effects of acupuncture, a novel experimental paradigm using the nonrepeated event-related (NRER) design was adopted. Psychophysical responses (deqi sensations) were also assessed. Finally, a newly multivariate Granger causality analysis (mGCA) was used to analyze effective connectivity patterns of the resting fMRI data taken following acupuncture at three acupoints.RESULTS: Following acupuncture at PC6, the red nucleus and substantia nigra emerged as central hubs, in comparison with the fusiform gyrus following acupuncture at GB37. Red nucleus was also a target following acupuncture at PC7, but with fewer inputs than those of PC6. In addition, the most important target following acupuncture at PC7 was located at the parahippocampus.CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that acupuncture at different acupoints may exert heterogeneous modulatory effects on the causal interactions of brain areas during the poststimulus resting state.

We analyzed data of 6 fMRI experiments, 4 of which belonged to the language domain. After regressing out specifics of the experimental design and low-pass filtering (<0.1 Hz), we found that the 4 language experiments produced a correlational pattern that was not present in the 2 nonlanguage studies. Specifically, a region in the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus/gyrus was consistently correlated with both the left Brodmann's area 44 and the left frontal operculum in all 4 language studies, whereas this correlation was not found in the 2 other experiments. This finding indicates the existence of a basic network that acts as a general framework for language processing. In contrast to networks obtained by a conventional conjunction analysis of activation maps, this network is independent of experimental specifics such as stimulus onsets and exists in the low-frequency range.",

Resting-state brain activity was investigated in 28 adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 27 typically developing controls being imaged with BOLD fMRI and analyzed with the ReHo method. The hypothesis was that ReHo of resting-state brain activity would be different between ASD subjects and controls in brain areas previously shown to display functional alterations in stimulus or task based fMRI studies. Compared with the controls, the subjects with ASD had significantly decreased ReHo in right superior temporal sulcus region, right inferior and middle frontal gyri, bilateral cerebellar crus I, right insula and right postcentral gyrus. Significantly increased ReHo was discovered in right thalamus, left inferior frontal and anterior subcallosal gyrus and bilateral cerebellar lobule VIII. We conclude that subjects with ASD have right dominant ReHo alterations of resting-state brain activity, i.e., areas known to exhibit abnormal stimulus or task related functionality.

    abstract = "Non-parametric data-driven analysis techniques can be used to study datasets with few assumptions about the data and underlying experiment. Variations of independent component analysis (ICA) have been the methods mostly used on fMRI data, e.g., in finding resting-state networks thought to reflect the connectivity of the brain. Here we present a novel data analysis technique and demonstrate it on resting-state fMRI data. It is a generic method with few underlying assumptions about the data. The results are built from the statistical relations between all input voxels, resulting in a whole-brain analysis on a voxel level. It has good scalability properties and the parallel implementation is capable of handling large datasets and databases. From the mutual information between the activities of the voxels over time, a distance matrix is created for all voxels in the input space. Multidimensional scaling is used to put the voxels in a lower-dimensional space reflecting the dependency relations based on the distance matrix. By performing clustering in this space we can find the strong statistical regularities in the data, which for the resting-state data turns out to be the resting-state networks. The decomposition is performed in the last step of the algorithm and is computationally simple. This opens up for rapid analysis and visualization of the data on different spatial levels, as well as automatically finding a suitable number of decomposition components.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the functional brain activity in the resting state is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, most studies focused on the relationship between different brain areas, rather than the amplitude or strength of the regional brain activity. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional brain changes in AD patients by measuring the amplitude of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) signals.METHODS: Twenty mild AD patients and twenty healthy elderly subjects participated in the fMRI scan. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated using REST software.RESULTS: Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, the mild AD patients showed decreased ALFF in the right posterior cingulate cortex, right ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and in the bilateral dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. No brain region with increased ALFF was found in the AD group compared with the control group.CONCLUSIONS: The reduced activity in the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex observed in the present study suggest that the functional abnormalities of those areas are at an early stage of AD. The ALFF analysis may provide a useful tool in fMRI study of AD",

    abstract = "The current study investigated the immediate neurophysiological effects of different types of massage in healthy adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Much attention has been given to the default mode network, a set of brain regions showing greater activity in the resting state. These regions (i.e. insula, posterior and anterior cingulate, inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortices) have been postulated to be involved in the neural correlates of consciousness, specifically in arousal and awareness. We posit that massage would modulate these same regions given the benefits and pleasant affective properties of touch. To this end, healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1. Swedish massage, 2. reflexology, 3. massage with an object or 4. a resting control condition. The right foot was massaged while each participant performed a cognitive association task in the scanner. We found that the Swedish massage treatment activated the subgenual anterior and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortices. This increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal was maintained only in the former brain region during performance of the cognitive task. Interestingly, the reflexology massage condition selectively affected the retrosplenial/posterior cingulate in the resting state, whereas massage with the object augmented the BOLD response in this region during the cognitive task performance. These findings should have implications for better understanding how alternative treatments might affect resting state neural activity and could ultimately be important for devising new targets in the management of mood disorders",

The results showed that ADHD patients had a significant decrease in the volume of the white matter (P = 0.04), and a trend toward decreased volume of brain structures except for the putamen and globus pallidus. The visualization of statistical difference maps of the cortical thickness showed that ADHD patients had focal thinning in bilateral frontal regions and the right cingulate cortex (P < 0.05 uncorrected, except for a cluster threshold of 10 voxels). Statistical analysis of the FA maps revealed that ADHD patients had significantly decreased FA in the forceps minor, the internal capsule, the corona radiata, the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the bilateral basal ganglia (P < 0.05 uncorrected as above). ADHD patients had significantly decreased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex, left precuneus and thalamus, but increased functional connectivity in bilateral posterior medial frontal cortex in the default mode network (P < 0.05 uncorrected as above). Our results provide new insights into the changes of the brain structure and function in ADHD, which suggests that alterations in the brain structural and functional connectivity might implicate the pathophysiology of ADHD.",

Temporal associations among RS networks were also explored. Experimental design: RS fMRI scans were acquired from 13 APN, 12 HPN, and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Independent component analysis and functional network connectivity were used to investigate RS FC within and among RS networks with potential functional relevance. PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: Compared to controls, patients had a decreased FC of the right precentral gyrus and an increased RS FC of the precuneus within the sensorimotor network. Both decreased and increased RS FC also involved the visual and auditory networks, which additionally had an increased coherence of function with the sensorimotor network (more pronounced in HPN). RS FC modifications in patients extended to several cognitive networks and were correlated with disease duration. In APN, they were also correlated with the severity of clinical impairment and corpus callosum atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: In PN, RS FC modifications extend beyond the sensorimotor network and involve other sensory and cognitive networks. The correlations between RS FC patterns and disease duration in patients as well as with clinical impairment in patients with APN suggest that modifications of FC might reflect an adaptive mechanism, which takes time to occur and helps to limit the clinical consequences of peripheral damage.

Typically, the posterior midline areas show this characteristic response in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjects exhibit a lack of this typical deactivation. The interpretation of these findings, however, is obfuscated by the presence of local pathology and atrophy in AD. In contrast to AD, in patients with early frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the precuneus is virtually free of local neuropathology. In this study, we demonstrate reduced fMRI signal in the precuneus in a group of patients with FTLD during a confrontation naming task. We show that this effect in FTLD patients was (1) similar to that observed in AD and MCI and (2) not related to the degree of gray matter atrophy in the precuneus. We hypothesize that reduced deactivation of the default network is not related to local pathology but to a lack of connectivity, which decreases in both FTLD and AD, the major cortical dementias.",

Although neuroimaging studies of patients have supported this network model of OCD, very few have applied measurements that are sensitive to brain connectivity features.OBJECTIVE:Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested the hypothesis that OCD is associated with disturbances in the functional connectivity of primarily ventral corticostriatal regions, measured from coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal.DESIGN:Case-control cross-sectional study.SETTING:Hospital referral OCD unit and magnetic resonance imaging facility.PARTICIPANTS:A total of 21 patients with OCD (10 men, 11 women) and 21 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and estimated intelligence.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Voxelwise statistical parametric maps testing the strength of functional connectivity of 4 striatal seed regions of interest (dorsal caudate nucleus, ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens, dorsal putamen, and ventral putamen) with remaining brain areas.RESULTS:For both groups, there was a clear distinction in the pattern of cortical connectivity of dorsal and ventral striatal regions, consistent with the notion of segregated motor, associative, and limbic corticostriatal networks. Between groups, patients with OCD had significantly increased functional connectivity along a ventral corticostriatal axis, implicating the orbitofrontal cortex and surrounding areas. The specific strength of connectivity between the ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens and the anterior orbitofrontal cortex predicted patients' overall symptom severity (r(2) = 0.57; P < .001). Additionally, patients with OCD showed evidence of reduced functional connectivity of the dorsal striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex, and of the ventral striatum with the region of the midbrain ventral tegmental area.CONCLUSIONS:This study directly supports the hypothesis that OCD is associated with functional alterations of brain corticostriatal networks. Specifically, our findings emphasize abnormal and heightened functional connectivity of ventrolimbic corticostriatal regions in patients with OCD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting state BOLD fMRI data were acquired at 3T from two independent cohorts of subjects consisting of healthy young (age 23 ± 2 years, n = 8) and aged volunteers (age 66 ± 3 years, n = 8), as well as 22 fAD associated subjects (14 mutation carriers, age 41.2 ± 15.8 years; and eight nonmutation carrying family members, age 28.8 ± 5.9 years). Mean ApEn values were compared between the two age groups and correlated with cognitive performance in the fAD group. Cross-ApEn (C-ApEn) was further calculated to assess the asynchrony between precuneus and the rest of the brain. RESULTS: Complexity of brain activity measured by mean ApEn in gray and white matter decreased with normal aging. In the fAD group, cognitive impairment was associated with decreased mean ApEn in gray matter as well as decreased regional ApEn in right precuneus, right lateral parietal regions, left precentral gyrus, and right paracentral gyrus. A pattern of asynchrony between BOLD fMRI series emerged from C-ApEn analysis, with significant regional anti-correlation with cross-correlation coefficient of functional connectivity analysis. CONCLUSION: ApEn and C-ApEn may be useful for assessing the complexity and synchronicity of brain activity in normal aging and cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases. J. Magn.

    abstract = "The human brain is inherently organized as separate networks as have been widely revealed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Although the large scale functional connectivity can be partially explained by the underlying white matter structural connectivity, the question of whether the underlying functional connectivity is related to brain metabolic factors is still largely unanswered. The present study investigated the presence of metabolic covariant networks across subjects using a set of Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F, FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. Spatial independent component analysis was performed on the subject-series of FDG-PET images. A number of networks that were mainly homotopic regions could be identified, including visual, auditory, motor, cerebellar, and subcortical networks. However, the anterior-posterior networks such as default mode and left fronto-parietal networks could not be observed. Regions of interest (ROI)-based correlation analysis confirmed that the inter-subject metabolic covariance within the default mode and left fronto-parietal networks were reduced as compared to corresponding time series correlations using resting-state fMRI from an independent sample. In contrast, homotopic inter-subject metabolic covariances observed using PET were comparable to the corresponding fMRI resting-state time series correlations. The current study provides preliminary illustration suggesting that the human brain metabolism pertains to organized covariance patterns that might partially reflect functional connectivity as revealed by resting-state BOLD. The discrepancy between the PET covariance and BOLD functional connectivity might reflect the differences of energy consumption coupling and ongoing neural synchronization within these brain networks",

    abstract = "Recently we introduced a robust measure, integrated local correlation (ILC), of local connectivity in the brain using fMRI data which reflects the temporal correlation of brain activity in every voxel neighborhood. The current work studies ILC in fMRI data obtained in the absence and presence of sevoflurane anesthesia (0\%, 2\%, and 1\% end-tidal concentration, respectively) administered to healthy volunteers. ILC was determined specifically in regions of the default mode network (DMN) to address local changes in each state. In addition, a potential confound in analyses based on correlations due to signal-to-noise variations was addressed by wavelet denoising. This accommodated decreases in signal power commonly seen during anesthesia without artificially reducing derived correlations. Results showed that ILC was significantly reduced in the entire DMN during 2\% sevoflurane yet recovered in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortices as well as inferior parietal cortex during 1\% sevoflurane. By contrast, ILC remained attenuated prefrontally in the 1\% condition, which indicates uncoupling of the frontal areas of DMN during light anesthesia. These results confirm widespread anesthetic-induced cortical suppression but also demonstrate that the local connectivity of the prefrontal cortex is rapidly reduced by sevoflurane. It remains to be seen whether these alterations arise locally as a direct consequence of anesthetic action on local neurons or are driven by distant changes in oscillations and activity elsewhere in the brain",

Although this rich inner experience occupies a large portion of the time spent awake, how it relates to brain activity has not been well explored. Here, we report the results of a behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of the continuous resting state in 307 healthy participants. The analysis focused on the relationship between the nature of inner experience and the temporal correlations computed between the low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations (0.01-0.1 Hz) of five large-scale modules. The subjects' self-reported time spontaneously spent on visual mental imagery and/or inner language was used as the behavioral variable. Decreased temporal correlations between modules were revealed when subjects reported more time spent thinking in mental images and inner language. These changes segregated the three modules supporting inner-oriented activities from those associated with sensory-related and externally guided activities. Among the brain areas associated with inner-oriented processing, the module including the lateral parietal and frontal regions (commonly described as being engaged in the manipulation and maintenance of internal information) was implicated in the majority of these effects. The preponderance of segregation appears to be the signature of the spontaneous sequence of thoughts during rest that are not constrained by logic, causality, or even a rigorous temporal organization. In other words, though goal-directed tasks have been demonstrated to rely on specific regional integration, mind wandering can be characterized by widespread modular segregation. Overall, the present study provides evidence that modulation of spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in the brain is at least partially explained by spontaneous conscious cognition while at rest",

    abstract = "While a tumour in or abutting primary motor cortex leads to motor weakness, how tumours elsewhere in the frontal or parietal lobes affect functional connectivity in a weak patient is less clear. We hypothesized that diminished functional connectivity in a distributed network of motor centres would correlate with motor weakness in subjects with brain masses. Furthermore, we hypothesized that interhemispheric connections would be most vulnerable to subtle disruptions in functional connectivity. We used task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity to probe motor networks in control subjects and patients with brain tumours (n = 22). Using a control dataset, we developed a method for automated detection of key nodes in the motor network, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area and superior parietal lobule, based on the anatomic location of the hand-motor knob in the primary motor cortex. We then calculated functional connectivity between motor network nodes in control subjects, as well as patients with and without brain masses. We used this information to construct weighted, undirected graphs, which were then compared to variables of interest, including performance on a motor task, the grooved pegboard. Strong connectivity was observed within the identified motor networks between all nodes bilaterally, and especially between the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. Reduced connectivity was observed in subjects with motor weakness versus subjects with normal strength (P < 0.001). This difference was driven mostly by decreases in interhemispheric connectivity between the primary motor cortices (P < 0.05) and between the left primary motor cortex and the right premotor area (P < 0.05), as well as other premotor area connections. In the subjects without motor weakness, however, performance on the grooved pegboard did not relate to interhemispheric connectivity, but rather was inversely correlated with connectivity between the left premotor area and left supplementary motor area, for both the left and the right hands (P < 0.01). Finally, two subjects who experienced severe weakness following surgery for their brain tumours were followed longitudinally, and the subject who recovered showed reconstitution of her motor network at follow-up. The subject who was persistently weak did not reconstitute his motor network. Motor weakness in subjects with brain tumours that do not involve primary motor structures is associated with decreased connectivity within motor functional networks, particularly interhemispheric connections. Motor networks become weaker as the subjects become weaker, and may become strong again during motor recovery",

Little is known, so far, about the changes in functional connectivity and in the topological properties of functional networks, associated with different brain diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated alterations related to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging on 18 mTLE patients and 27 healthy controls. Functional connectivity among 90 cortical and subcortical regions was measured by temporal correlation. The related values were analyzed to construct a set of undirected graphs. Compared to controls, mTLE patients showed significantly increased connectivity within the medial temporal lobes, but also significantly decreased connectivity within the frontal and parietal lobes, and between frontal and parietal lobes. Our findings demonstrated that a large number of areas in the default-mode network of mTLE patients showed a significantly decreased number of connections to other regions. Furthermore, we observed altered small-world properties in patients, along with smaller degree of connectivity, increased n-to-1 connectivity, smaller absolute clustering coefficients and shorter absolute path length. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We suggest that the mTLE alterations observed in functional connectivity and topological properties may be used to define tentative disease markers.",

Although TPJ has been implicated both in reorienting of attention and social cognition, it is still unclear whether these functions have the same neural basis. Indeed, whether TPJ is a precisely identifiable cortical region or a cluster of subregions with separate functions is still a matter of debate. Here, we examined the structural and functional connectivity of TPJ, testing whether TPJ is a unitary area with a heterogeneous functional connectivity profile or a conglomerate of regions with distinctive connectivity. Diffusion-weighted imaging tractrography-based parcellation identified 3 separate regions in TPJ. Resting-state functional connectivity was then used to establish which cortical networks each of these subregions participates in. A dorsal cluster in the middle part of the inferior parietal lobule showed resting-state functional connectivity with, among other areas, lateral anterior prefrontal cortex. Ventrally, an anterior TPJ cluster interacted with ventral prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, while a posterior TPJ cluster interacted with posterior cingulate, temporal pole, and anterior medial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that TPJ can be subdivided into subregions on the basis of its structural and functional connectivity",

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the existence of spontaneous activity in the primary visual areas (PVA) of normal-sighted subjects and to explore the physiological implications of such activity. Our results revealed that we were able to detect spontaneous activity, which was nonrandom in that it was distinctly clustered both temporally and spatially in the PVA of each subject. In addition, the neural network associated with the PVA-related spontaneous activity included the visual association areas, the precuneus, the precentral/postcentral gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, the fusiform gyrus, the inferior/middle temporal gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. After considering the functions of these regions, we speculated that the PVA-related spontaneous activity may be associated with memory-related mental imagery and/or visual memory consolidation processes. These findings confirm the presence of spontaneous activity in the PVA and related brain areas. This confirmation supports the perspective that brain is a system intrinsically operating on its own, and sensory information interacts with rather than determines the operation of the system.",

    abstract = "This article firstly presents a theoretical analysis of the statistical power of a parallel-group, repeated-measures (two-session) and two-centre design suitable for a placebo-controlled pharmacological MRI study. For arbitrary effect size, power is determined by the pooled between-session error, the pooled measurement error, the ratio of centre measurement errors, the total number of subjects and the proportion of subjects studied at the centre with greatest measurement error. Secondly, an experiment is described to obtain empirical estimates of variance components in task-related and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twelve healthy volunteers were scanned at two centres during performance of blocked and event-related versions of an affect processing task (each repeated twice per session) and rest. In activated regions, variance components were estimated: between-subject (23\% of total), between-centre (2\%), between-paradigm (4\%), within-session occasion (paradigm repeat; 2\%) and residual (measurement) error (69\%). The between-centre ratio of measurement errors was 0.8. A similar analysis for the Hurst exponent estimated in resting data showed negligible contributions of between-subject and between-centre variability; measurement error accounted for 99\% of total variance. Substituting these estimates in the theoretical expression for power, incorporation of two centres in the design necessitates a modest (10\%) increase in the total number of subjects compared with a single-centre study. Furthermore, considerable improvements in power can be attained by repetition of the task within each scanning session. Thus, theoretical models of power and empirical data indicate that between-centre variability can be small enough to encourage multicentre designs without major compensatory increases in sample size.",

During normal conditions, baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 110 +/- 10 mm Hg and low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal were observed in the frequency range of 0.01 - 0.125 Hz. Following blood withdrawal (exsanguination), MAP decreased to 68 +/- 7 mm Hg, resulting in an increase in the amplitude of the low-frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal time series and an increase in power at several frequencies between 0.01 and 0.125 Hz. Spatially, the BOLD fluctuations were confined to the cortex and thalamus spanning both hemispheres with sparse presence in the caudate putamen and hippocampus during both normal and exsanguinated states. Spatial distribution of the low frequency fluctuations in BOLD signal, from cross correlation analysis, indicates substantial inter-hemispheric synchrony similar to that observed in the conscious human brain. The behavior of the resting state BOLD signal fluctuations similar to CBF fluctuations during exsanguination indicates a myogenic dependence. Also, a high inter-hemispheric synchrony combined with different phase characteristics of the low frequency BOLD fluctuations particularly in the hippocampus relative to the cortex emphasizes distinct functional networks.",

Although this region has been linked to controlled semantic processing of materials, it may also play a more general role in selecting among competing episodic representations during demanding retrieval tasks. Thus, the LVPFC response during context memory retrieval may reflect either semantic processing of memoranda or adjudication of interfering episodic memories evoked by memoranda. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we contrasted context and item memory retrieval tasks for meaningful and nonmeaningful memoranda using fMRI. Increased LVPFC activation during context compared with item memory only occurred for meaningful memory probes. In contrast, even demanding context retrieval for nonmeaningful materials failed to engage LVPFC. These data demonstrate that the activation previously seen during episodic tasks likely reflects semantic processing of the probes during episodic retrieval attempt, not the selection among competing elicited episodic representations. Posterior middle temporal gyrus and the body/head of the caudate demonstrated the same selective response as LVPFC, although resting state functional connectivity analyses suggested that these two regions likely shared separate functional relationships with the LVPFC",

It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments",

    abstract = "Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations (<0.1 Hz), observed in BOLD fMRI signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions-or functional connectivity (FC)-have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks (RSNs). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured FC. The best agreement of the simulated FC with the empirically measured FC is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated BOLD signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed RSNs. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain.",

The metabolic correlate of inhibition was a multifocal (premotor, primary sensorimotor, superior parietal, cingulate cortex, and cerebellum) decrease of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal to below the resting state (negative BOLD) with a concomitant decrease of motor cortical excitability. The reverse was true for retrieval.

METHODS: We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theory approaches to systematically investigate the topological organization of the functional connectome of 37 patients with aMCI and 47 healthy control subjects. Frequency-dependent brain networks were derived from wavelet-based correlations of both high- and low-resolution parcellation units. RESULTS: In the frequency interval .031-.063 Hz, the aMCI patients showed an overall decreased functional connectivity of their brain connectome compared with control subjects. Further graph theory analyses of this frequency band revealed an increased path length of the connectome in the aMCI group. Moreover, the disease targeted several key nodes predominantly in the default-mode regions and key links primarily in the intramodule connections within the default-mode network and the intermodule connections among different functional systems. Intriguingly, the topological aberrations correlated with the patients' memory performance and differentiated individuals with aMCI from healthy elderly individuals with a sensitivity of 86.5\% and a specificity of 85.1\%. Finally, we demonstrated a high reproducibility of our findings across different large-scale parcellation schemes and validated the test-retest reliability of our network-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a disruption of whole-brain topological organization of the functional connectome in aMCI. Our finding provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of aMCI and highlights the potential for using connectome-based metrics as a disease biomarker",

Depressed patients with vascular risk factors showed decrease in ALFF in the limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit. Specifically, the altered ALFF values (i.e., left insula and right superior frontal gyrus) were significantly correlated with depression severity in the depressed group. In addition, higher ALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus were observed in depressed patients with vascular risk factors. Our findings reveal distinct functional patterns of abnormal brain activity in depressed patients with vascular risk factors and have implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of this understudied population",

    abstract = "The default network exhibits correlated activity at rest and has shown decreased activation during performance of cognitive tasks. There has been little investigation of changes in connectivity of this network during task performance. In this study, we examined task-related modulation of connectivity between two seed regions from the default network posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the rest of the brain in 12 healthy adults. The purpose was to determine (1) whether connectivity within the default network differs between a resting state and performance of a cognitive (working memory) task and (2) whether connectivity differs between these nodes of the default network and other brain regions, particularly those implicated in cognitive tasks. There was little change in connectivity with the other main areas of the default network for either seed region, but moderate task-related changes in connectivity occurred between seed regions and regions outside the default network. For example, connectivity of the mPFC with the right insula and the right superior frontal gyrus decreased during task performance. Increased connectivity during the working memory task occurred between the PCC and bilateral inferior frontal gyri, and between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus, cuneus, superior parietal lobule, middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum. Overall, the areas showing greater correlation with the default network seed regions during task than at rest have been previously implicated in working memory tasks. These changes may reflect a decrease in the negative correlations occurring between the default and task-positive networks at rest.",

However, little is known about whether the spontaneous brain activity at rest is relevant to the differences in intelligence. Here, 59 healthy adult subjects (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale score, 90-138) were studied with resting state fMRI. We took the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) as the seed regions and investigated the correlations across subjects between individual intelligence scores and the strength of the functional connectivity (FC) between the seed regions and other brain regions. We found that the brain regions in which the strength of the FC significantly correlated with intelligence scores were distributed in the frontal, parietal, occipital and limbic lobes. Stepwise linear regression analysis also revealed that the FCs within the frontal lobe and between the frontal and posterior brain regions were both important predictive factors for the differences in intelligence. These findings support a network view of intelligence, as suggested in previous studies. More importantly, our findings suggest that brain activity may be relevant to the differences in intelligence even in the resting state and in the absence of an explicit cognitive demand. This could provide a new perspective for understanding the neural basis of intelligence",

    abstract = "One of the most intriguing recent discoveries concerning brain function is that intrinsic neuronal activity manifests as spontaneous fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI signal. These BOLD fluctuations exhibit temporal synchrony within widely distributed brain regions known as resting-state networks. Resting-state networks are present in the waking state, during sleep, and under general anesthesia, suggesting that spontaneous neuronal activity plays a fundamental role in brain function. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the physiological role of correlated, spontaneous neuronal activity remains poorly understood. One hypothesis is that this activity is critical for the development of synaptic connections and maintenance of synaptic homeostasis. We had a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis in a 5-y-old boy with severe epileptic encephalopathy. The child developed marked neurologic dysfunction in association with a seizure disorder, resulting in a 1-y period of behavioral regression and progressive loss of developmental milestones. His EEG showed a markedly abnormal pattern of high-amplitude, disorganized slow activity with frequent generalized and multifocal epileptiform discharges. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI showed reduced BOLD fluctuations and a pervasive lack of normal connectivity. The child underwent successful corpus callosotomy surgery for treatment of drop seizures. Postoperatively, the patient's behavior returned to baseline, and he resumed development of new skills. The waking EEG revealed a normal background, and functional connectivity MRI demonstrated restoration of functional connectivity architecture. These results provide evidence that intrinsic, coherent neuronal signaling may be essential to the development and maintenance of the brain's functional organization.",

A short repetition time of 1860 ms was made possible by the use of slice multiplexing which permitted whole brain coverage at high spatial resolution (84 slices of 1.6 mm thickness). Radiofrequency power deposition was kept within regulatory limits by use of the power independent of number of slices (PINS) technique. A high in-plane spatial resolution of 1.5 mm was obtained, while image distortion was ameliorated by the use of in-plane parallel imaging techniques. Data from six subjects were obtained with a measurement time of just over 15 min per subject. A group level independent component (IC) analysis revealed 24 non-artefactual resting state networks, including those commonly found in standard acquisitions, as well as plausible networks for a broad range of regions. Signal was measured from regions commonly rendered inaccessible due to signal voids in gradient echo acquisitions. Dual regression was used to obtain spatial IC maps at the single subject level revealing exquisite localisation to grey matter that is consistent with a high degree of T(2)-weighting in the acquisition sequence. This technique hence holds great promise for both resting state and activation studies at 7 T",

Sixteen healthy subjects were scanned at locomotion and rest with [(18)F]-FDG-PET. In the locomotion paradigm subjects walked at constant velocity for 10 min. Then [(18)F]-FDG was injected intravenously while subjects continued walking for another 10 min. For comparison fMRI was performed in the same subjects during imagined walking. During real and imagined locomotion a basic locomotion network including activations in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, pontomesencephalic tegmentum, parahippocampal, fusiform and occipital gyri, and deactivations in the multisensory vestibular cortices (esp. superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule) was shown. As a difference, the primary motor and somatosensory cortices were activated during real locomotion as distinct to the supplementary motor cortex and basal ganglia during imagined locomotion. Activations of the brainstem locomotor centers were more prominent in imagined locomotion. In conclusion, basic activation and deactivation patterns of real locomotion correspond to that of imagined locomotion. The differences may be due to distinct patterns of locomotion tested. Contrary to constant velocity real locomotion (10 min) in [(18)F]-FDG-PET, mental imagery of locomotion over repeated 20-s periods includes gait initiation and velocity changes. Real steady-state locomotion seems to use a direct pathway via the primary motor cortex, whereas imagined modulatory locomotion an indirect pathway via a supplementary motor cortex and basal ganglia loop.",

    abstract = {Analyses of spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations observed on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed the existence of temporal correlations in signal changes between widely separated brain regions during the resting state, termed "resting state functional connectivity." Recent studies have demonstrated that these correlations are also present in the hemodynamic signals measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). However, it is still uncertain whether frequency-specific characteristics exist in these signals. In the present study, we used multichannel NIRS to investigate the frequency dependency of functional connectivity between diverse regions in the cerebral cortex by decomposing fluctuations of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) signals into various frequency bands. First, within a wide frequency range (0.009-0.1Hz), we observed that both oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb signals showed functional connectivity within local regions and between contralateral hemispheric regions of the cortex. Next, by decomposing measured fluctuations into narrower frequency components, we determined that only oxy-Hb signals showed frequency-specific functional connectivity between the frontal and occipital regions, emerging in a narrow frequency range (0.04-0.1Hz). To clarify the coherency of functional connectivity, we calculated the average coherence values between selected channel pairs. This approach demonstrated that functional connectivity based on the oxy-Hb signals between homologous cortical regions of the contralateral hemisphere (homologous connectivity) showed high coherence over a wide frequency range (0.009-0.1Hz), whereas connectivity between the prefrontal and occipital regions (fronto-posterior connectivity) showed high coherence only within a specific narrow frequency range (0.04-0.1Hz). Our findings suggest that homologous connectivity may reflect synchronization of neural activation over a wide frequency range through direct neuroanatomical connections, whereas fronto-posterior connectivity as revealed by high coherence only within a specific narrow frequency range corresponding to the time scale of typical hemodynamic response to a single event may reflect synchronization of transient neural activation among distant cortical regions. The present study demonstrated that NIRS provides a powerful tool to elucidate network properties of the cortex during resting state.},

    abstract = "Resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that allows repeated assessments of functional connectivity in resting state. While task-related FMRI is limited to indirectly measured drug effects in areas affected by the task, resting state can show direct CNS effects across all brain networks. Hence, RS-FMRI could be an objective measure for compounds affecting the CNS. Several studies on the effects of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1))-receptor agonist $\delta$(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on task-dependent FMRI have been performed. However, no studies on the effects of cannabinoids on resting state networks using RS-FMRI have been published. Therefore, we investigated the effects of THC on functional brain connectivity using RS-FMRI. Twelve healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 female) inhaled 2, 6 and 6mg THC or placebo with 90-minute intervals in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial. Eight RS-FMRI scans of 8min were obtained per occasion. Subjects rated subjective psychedelic effects on a visual analog scale after each scan, as pharmacodynamic effect measures. Drug-induced effects on functional connectivity were examined using dual regression with FSL software (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford). Eight maps of voxel-wise connectivity throughout the entire brain were provided per RS-FMRI series with eight predefined resting-state networks of interest. These maps were used in a mixed effects model group analysis to determine brain regions with a statistically significant drug-by-time interaction. Statistical images were cluster-corrected, and results were Bonferroni-corrected across multiple contrasts. THC administration increased functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, and was associated with dissociable lateralized connectivity changes in the right and left dorsal visual stream networks. The brain regions showing connectivity changes included the cerebellum and dorsal frontal cortical regions. Clear increases were found for feeling high, external perception, heart rate and cortisol, whereas prolactin decreased. This study shows that THC induces both increases and (to a lesser extent) decreases in functional brain connectivity, mainly in brain regions with high densities of CB(1)-receptors. Some of the involved regions could be functionally related to robust THC-induced CNS-effects that have been found in previous studies (Zuurman et al., 2008), such as postural stability, feeling high and altered time perception",

Here we use network analysis of intrinsic functional connectivity to characterize the organization of brain networks in 23 children (ages 7-9 y) and 22 young-adults (ages 19-22 y). Comparison of network properties, including path-length, clustering-coefficient, hierarchy, and regional connectivity, revealed that although children and young-adults' brains have similar "small-world" organization at the global level, they differ significantly in hierarchical organization and interregional connectivity. We found that subcortical areas were more strongly connected with primary sensory, association, and paralimbic areas in children, whereas young-adults showed stronger cortico-cortical connectivity between paralimbic, limbic, and association areas. Further, combined analysis of functional connectivity with wiring distance measures derived from white-matter fiber tracking revealed that the development of large-scale brain networks is characterized by weakening of short-range functional connectivity and strengthening of long-range functional connectivity. Importantly, our findings show that the dynamic process of over-connectivity followed by pruning, which rewires connectivity at the neuronal level, also operates at the systems level, helping to reconfigure and rebalance subcortical and paralimbic connectivity in the developing brain. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of network analysis of brain connectivity to elucidate key principles underlying functional brain maturation, paving the way for novel studies of disrupted brain connectivity in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism},

With submillimeter resolution, we are able to detect not only the separate islands of activation corresponding to vibrotactile stimulations of single digits but also, in subsequent acquisitions, the degree of correlation between voxels within the SI cortex in the resting state. The results suggest that connectivity patterns are very similar to stimulus-driven distributions of activity and that connectivity varies on the scale of millimeters within the same primary region. Connectivity strength is not a reflection of global larger-scale changes in blood flow and is not directly dependent on distance between regions. Preliminary electrophysiological recordings agree well with the fMRI data.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cognitive abilities, such as working memory, differ among people; however, individuals also vary in their own day-to-day cognitive performance. One potential source of cognitive variability may be fluctuations in the functional organization of neural systems. The degree to which the organization of these functional networks is optimized may relate to the effective cognitive functioning of the individual. Here we specifically examine how changes in the organization of large-scale networks measured via resting state functional connectivity MRI and graph theory track changes in working memory capacity.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-two participants performed a test of working memory capacity and then underwent resting-state fMRI. Seventeen subjects repeated the protocol three weeks later. We applied graph theoretic techniques to measure network organization on 34 brain regions of interest (ROI). Network modularity, which measures the level of integration and segregation across sub-networks, and small-worldness, which measures global network connection efficiency, both predicted individual differences in memory capacity; however, only modularity predicted intra-individual variation across the two sessions. Partial correlations controlling for the component of working memory that was stable across sessions revealed that modularity was almost entirely associated with the variability of working memory at each session. Analyses of specific sub-networks and individual circuits were unable to consistently account for working memory capacity variability.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the intrinsic functional organization of an a priori defined cognitive control network measured at rest provides substantial information about actual cognitive performance. The association of network modularity to the variability in an individual's working memory capacity suggests that the organization of this network into high connectivity within modules and sparse connections between modules may reflect effective signaling across brain regions, perhaps through the modulation of signal or the suppression of the propagation of noise",

The above results suggest that abnormal functional relationships between the putamen and the cortical-striatal-thalamic circuits as well as the default mode network may underlie the pathological basis of ADHD.},

The thalamocortical system serves as a good model system for exploring structure/function relationships because of its well-documented anatomical connectivity. Here we performed functional and structural magnetic resonance mapping of the human thalamocortical system using intrinsic brain activity and diffusion-weighted imaging. The accuracy of these imaging techniques is tested by comparison with human histology registered to common anatomical space and connectional anatomy derived from nonhuman primates. In general, there is good overall concordance among structural, functional, and histological results which suggests that a simple model of direct anatomical connectivity between the cerebral cortex and the thalamus is capable of explaining much of the observed correlations in neuronal activity. However, important differences between structural and functional mapping results are also manifest which suggests a more complex interpretation and emphasizes the unique contributions from structural and functional mapping",

The integrated analysis of the data requires robust tools for segmentation, registration and fiber tracking, which we combine in an automated manner. Our automated workflow is strongly desired due to the large number of subjects. Especially, we introduce the use of histogram segmentation to processed fMRI data to obtain functionally important seed and target regions for fiber tracking between them. This enables analysis of individually important resting state networks. We also discuss various approaches for the assessment of white matter integrity parameters along tracts, and in particular we introduce the use of functional data analysis (FDA) for this task",

    abstract = "Blood oxygen contrast-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals are a convolution of neural and vascular components. Several studies indicate that task-related (T-fMRI) or resting-state (R-fMRI) responses linearly relate to hypercapnic task responses. Based on the linearity of R-fMRI and T-fMRI with hypercapnia demonstrated by different groups using different study designs, we hypothesized that R-fMRI and T-fMRI signals are governed by a common physiological mechanism and that resting-state fluctuation of amplitude (RSFA) should be linearly related to T-fMRI responses. We tested this prediction in a group of healthy younger humans where R-fMRI, T-fMRI, and hypercapnic (breath hold, BH) task measures were obtained form the same scan session during resting state and during performance of motor and BH tasks. Within individual subjects, significant linear correlations were observed between motor and BH task responses across voxels. When averaged over the whole brain, the subject-wise correlation between the motor and BH tasks showed a similar linear relationship within the group. Likewise, a significant linear correlation was observed between motor-task activity and RSFA across voxels and subjects. The linear rest-task (R-T) relationship between motor activity and RSFA suggested that R-fMRI and T-fMRI responses are governed by similar physiological mechanisms. A practical use of the R-T relationship is its potential to estimate T-fMRI responses in special populations unable to perform tasks during fMRI scanning. Using the R-T relationship determined from the first group of 12 healthy subjects, we predicted the T-fMRI responses in a second group of 7 healthy subjects. RSFA in both the lower and higher frequency ranges robustly predicted the magnitude of T-fMRI responses at the subject and voxel levels. We propose that T-fMRI responses are reliably predictable to the voxel level in situations where only R-fMRI measures are possible, and may be useful for assessing neural activity in task non-compliant clinical populations",

A new holistic approach has been used to investigate functional connectivity changes in the brains of patients suffering from major depression using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. A canonical template of connectivity in 90 different brain regions was constructed from healthy control subjects and this identified a six-community structure with each network corresponding to a different functional system. This template was compared with functional networks derived from fMRI scans of both first-episode and longer-term, drug resistant, patients suffering from severe depression. The greatest change in both groups of depressed patients was uncoupling of the so-called 'hate circuit' involving the superior frontal gyrus, insula and putamen. Other major changes occurred in circuits related to risk and action responses, reward and emotion, attention and memory processing. A voxel-based morphometry analysis was also carried out but this revealed no evidence in the depressed patients for altered gray or white matter densities in the regions showing altered functional connectivity. This is the first evidence for the involvement of the 'hate circuit' in depression and suggests a potential reappraisal of the key neural circuitry involved. We have hypothesized that this may reflect reduced cognitive control over negative feelings toward both self and others.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 4 October 2011; doi:10.1038/mp.2011.127.",

To further discern the brain default mode network as well as its anti-correlation network during resting-state, we used three methods to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data; regional homogeneity analysis, linear correlation and independent component analysis, on four groups of dataset. Our results showed the existence of these two networks prominently and consistently during a resting- and conscious-state across the three methods.

Furthermore, without adequate explanatory nociceptive input, patients with somatoform pain disorder experience pain symptoms, thus implicating a central dysregulation of pain homeostasis. The present study aimed to test whether interactions among pain-related ICNs, such as the default mode network (DMN), cingular-insular network (CIN) and sensorimotor network (SMN), are altered in somatoform pain during resting conditions. Methods: Patients with somatoform pain disorder and healthy controls underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging that lasted 370 seconds. Using a data-driven approach, the ICNs were isolated, and the functional network connectivity (FNC) was computed. Results: Twenty-one patients and 19 controls enrolled in the study. Significant FNC (p < 0.05, corrected for false discovery rate) was detected between the CIN and SMN/anterior DMN, the anterior DMN and posterior DMN/SMN, and the posterior DMN and SMN. Interestingly, no group differences in FNC were detected. Limitations: The most important limitation of this study was the relatively short resting state paradigm. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our results demonstrated for the first time the resting FNC among pain-related ICNs. However, our results suggest that FNC signatures alone are not able to characterize the putative central dysfunction underpinning somatoform pain disorder",

In contrast, post-mortem studies indicate that pathological changes in Parkinson's disease (Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies) first appear primarily in the lower brainstem with subsequent progression to more rostral parts of the neuraxis. The nigrostriatal and histological perspectives are not incompatible, but they do emphasize different anatomical structures. To address the question of which brain structures are functionally most affected by Parkinson's disease, we performed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study focused on striatal functional connectivity. We contrasted 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease versus 19 age-matched control subjects, using methodology incorporating scrupulous attention to minimizing the effects of head motion during scanning. The principal finding in the Parkinson's disease group was markedly lower striatal correlations with thalamus, midbrain, pons and cerebellum. This result reinforces the importance of the brainstem in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Focally altered functional connectivity also was observed in sensori-motor and visual areas of the cerebral cortex, as well the supramarginal gyrus. Striatal functional connectivity with the brainstem was graded (posterior putamen > anterior putamen > caudate), in both patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects, in a manner that corresponds to well-documented gradient of striatal dopaminergic function loss in Parkinson's disease.

This study characterized and correlated functional HE abnormalities in the brain to cerebral edema using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Forty-one cirrhotic patients (16 without HE, 14 minimal HE, 11 overt HE) and 32 healthy controls were assessed. The HE grade in cirrhotic patients was evaluated by the West Haven criteria and neuro-psychological examinations. Functional connectivity correlation coefficient (fc-CC) of the default mode network (DMN) was determined by rs-fMRI, while the corresponding mean diffusivity (MD) was obtained from DTI. Correlations among inter-cortical fc-CC, DTI indices, Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument scores, and laboratory tests were also analyzed. Results showed that gradual reductions of HE-related consciousness levels, from "without HE" or "minimal HE" to "overt HE", correlated with decreased anterior-posterior fc-CC in DMN [F(4.415), p = 0.000)]. The MD values from regions with anterior-posterior fc-CC differences in DMN revealed significant differences between the overt HE group and other groups. Increased MD in this network was inversely associated with decreased fc-CC in DMN and linearly correlated with poor cognitive performance. In conclusion, cerebral edema can be linked to altered cerebral temporal architecture that modifies both within- and between-network connectivity in HE. Reduced fc-CC in DMN is associated with behavior and consciousness deterioration. Through appropriate targets, rs-fMRI technology may provide relevant supplemental information for monitoring HE and serve as a new biomarker for clinical diagnosis},

Little is known, however, about alterations in limbic and frontal regions associated with the integrated morphometric, functional, and structural architecture of SAD. Whether altered gray matter volume is associated with altered functional and structural connectivity in SAD. Three techniques were used with 18 SAD patients and 18 healthy controls: voxel-based morphometry; resting-state functional connectivity analysis; and diffusion tensor imaging tractography. SAD patients exhibited significantly decreased gray matter volumes in the right posterior inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and right parahippocampal/hippocampal gyrus (PHG/HIP). Gray matter volumes in these two regions negatively correlated with the fear factor of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. In addition, we found increased functional connectivity in SAD patients between the right posterior ITG and the left inferior occipital gyrus, and between the right PHF/HIP and left middle temporal gyrus. SAD patients had increased right MPFC volume, along with enhanced structural connectivity in the genu of the corpus callosum. Reduced limbic/paralimbic volume, together with increased resting-state functional connectivity, suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanism in SAD. Increased MPFC volume, consonant with enhanced structural connectivity, suggests a long-time overgeneralization of structural connectivity and a role of this area in the mediation of clinical severity. Overall, our results may provide a valuable basis for future studies combining morphometric, functional and anatomical data in the search for a comprehensive understanding of the neural circuitry underlying SAD.",

VENs are reported to be altered in pathologies such as frontotemporal dementia and autism, in which the individual's self control is seriously compromised. To investigate the role of VENs in the active human brain, we have explored the functional connectivity of brain areas containing VENs by analyzing resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 20 healthy volunteers. Our results show that cortical areas containing VENs form a network of frontoparietal functional connectivity. With the use of fuzzy clustering techniques, we find that this network comprises four sub-networks: the first network cluster resembles a "saliency detection" attentional network, which includes superior frontal cortex (Brodmann's Area, BA 10), inferior parietal lobe, anterior insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; the second cluster, part of a "sensory-motor network", comprises the superior temporal, precentral and postcentral areas; the third cluster consists of frontal ventromedial and ventrodorsal areas constituted by parts of the "anterior default mode network"; and the fourth cluster encompasses dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal, and superior frontal (BA 10) areas, resembling the anterior part of the "dorsal attentional network". Thus, the network that emerges from analyzing functional connectivity among areas that are known to contain VENs is primarily involved in functions of saliency detection and self-regulation. In addition, parts of this network constitute sub-networks that partially overlap with the default mode, the sensory-motor and the dorsal attentional networks},

    title = "{Altered resting-state amygdala functional connectivity in men with posttraumatic stress disorder.}",
    abstract = "Background: Converging neuroimaging research suggests altered emotion neurocircuitry in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion activation studies in these individuals have shown hyperactivation in emotion-related regions, including the amygdala and insula, and hypoactivation in emotion-regulation regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have examined patterns of connectivity at rest in individuals with PTSD, a potentially powerful method for illuminating brain network structure. Methods: Using the amygdala as a seed region, we measured resting-state brain connectivity using 3-T functional magnetic resonance imaging in returning male veterans with PTSD and combat controls without PTSD. Results: Fifteen veterans with PTSD and 14 combat controls enrolled in our study. Compared with controls, veterans with PTSD showed greater positive connectivity between the amygdala and insula, reduced positive connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and reduced anticorrelation between the amygdala and dorsal ACC and rostral ACC. Limitations: Only male veterans with combat exposure were tested, thus our findings cannot be generalized to women or to individuals with non-combat related PTSD. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that studies of functional connectivity during resting state can discern aberrant patterns of coupling within emotion circuits and suggest a possible brain basis for emotion-processing and emotion-regulation deficits in individuals with PTSD",

    abstract = "A lot of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have indicated that Granger causality analysis (GCA) is a suitable method to reveal causal effect among brain regions. Based on another MATLAB GUI toolkit, Resting State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST), we implemented GCA on MATLAB as a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. This toolkit, namely REST-GCA, could output both the residual-based F and the signed-path coefficient. REST-GCA also intergrates a programme that could transform the distribution of residual-based F to approximately normal distribution and then permit parametric statistical inference at group level. Using REST-GCA, we tested the causal effect of the right frontal-insular cortex (rFIC) onto each voxel in the whole brain, and vice versa, each voxel in the whole brain on the rFIC, in a voxel-wise way in a resting-state fMRI dataset from 30 healthy college students. Using Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit test and the Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test, we found that the transformation from F to F' and the further standardization from F' to Z score substantially improved the normality. The results of one sample t-tests on Z score showed bi-directional positive causal effect between rFIC and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). One sample t-tests on the signed-path coefficients showed positive causal effect from rFIC to dACC but negative from dACC to rFIC. All these results indicate that REST-GCA may be useful toolkit for caudal analysis of fMRI data",

    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To explore the gender differences of brain regional homogeneity (ReHo) in healthy subjects during the resting-state, after normal sleep, and after sleep deprivation (SD) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the ReHo method. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects (eight males and eight females) each underwent the resting-state fMRI exams twice, i.e., once after normal sleep and again after 24h's SD. According to the gender and sleep, 16 subjects were all measured twice and divided into four groups: the male control group (MC), female control group (FC), male SD group (MSD), and female SD group (FSD). The ReHo method was used to calculate and analyze the data, SPM5 software was used to perform a two-sample T-test and a two-pair T-test with a P value <0.001, and cluster volume ⩾270mm(3) was used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Compared with the MC, the MSD showed significantly higher ReHo in the right paracentral lobule (BA3/6), but in no obviously lower regions. Compared with the FC, the FSD showed significantly higher ReHo in bilateral parietal lobes (BA2/3), bilateral vision-related regions of occipital lobes (BA17/18/19), right frontal lobe (BA4/6), and lower ReHo in the right frontal lobe. Compared with the FC, the MC showed significantly higher ReHo in the left occipital lobe (BA18/19), and left temporal lobe (BA21), left frontal lobe, and lower ReHo in the right insula and in the left parietal lobe. Compared with the FSD, the MSD showed significantly higher ReHo in the left cerebellum posterior lobe (uvula/declive of vermis), left parietal lobe, and bilateral frontal lobes, and lower ReHo in the right occipital lobe (BA17) and right frontal lobe (BA4). CONCLUSIONS: The differences of brain activity in the resting state can be widely found not only between the control and SD group in a same gender group, but also between the male group and female group. Thus, we should take the gender differences into consideration in future fMRI studies, especially the treatment of brain-related diseases (e.g., depression)",

Although this so-called 'resting-state activity' appears to be correlated across brain regions with apparent functional relationship, its origin might be predominantly vascular and not directly representing neuronal signaling. To investigate this, we simultaneously measured BOLD and perfusion signals on healthy human subjects (n=11) and used their ratio (BOLD/perfusion ratio or BPR) as an indicator of metabolic demand. BPR during rest and sleep was compared with that during a visual task (VT) and a breath-holding task (BH), which are challenges with substantial and little metabolic involvement, respectively. Within the visual cortex, BPR was 3.76+/-1.23 during BH, which was significantly higher than during the VT (1.76+/-0.27) and rest (1.56+/-0.41). Meanwhile, BPR values during VT and rest were not significantly different, suggesting a similar metabolic involvement. Eight subjects showed stage 1 and 2 sleep, during which temporally correlated BOLD and perfusion activity continued. In these subjects, there was no significant difference in BPR between the sleep and waking conditions (1.79+/-0.54 and 1.66+/-0.67, respectively), but both were lower than the BPR during BH. These data suggest that resting-state activity, at least in part, represents a metabolic process.",

However, current definitions of modularity for complex networks focus on nonoverlapping clusters, and are seriously limited by disregarding inclusive relationships. Therefore, BFC's modularity has been mainly qualitatively investigated. Here, we introduce a new definition of modularity, based on a recently improved clustering measurement, which overcomes limitations of previous definitions, and apply it to the study of BFC in resting state fMRI of 53 healthy subjects.

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is used clinically for the treatment of depression. However, the antidepressant mechanism remains unknown and its therapeutic efficacy remains limited. Recent data suggest that some left DLPFC targets are more effective than others; however, the reasons for this heterogeneity and how to capitalize on this information remain unclear. METHODS: Intrinsic (resting state) functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 98 normal subjects were used to compute functional connectivity with various left DLPFC TMS targets employed in the literature. Differences in functional connectivity related to differences in previously reported clinical efficacy were identified. This information was translated into a connectivity-based targeting strategy to identify optimized left DLPFC TMS coordinates. Results in normal subjects were tested for reproducibility in an independent cohort of 13 patients with depression. RESULTS: Differences in functional connectivity were related to previously reported differences in clinical efficacy across a distributed set of cortical and limbic regions. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex TMS sites with better clinical efficacy were more negatively correlated (anticorrelated) with the subgenual cingulate. Optimum connectivity-based stimulation coordinates were identified in Brodmann area 46. Results were reproducible in patients with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Reported antidepressant efficacy of different left DLPFC TMS sites is related to the anticorrelation of each site with the subgenual cingulate, potentially lending insight into the antidepressant mechanism of TMS and suggesting a role for intrinsically anticorrelated networks in depression. These results can be translated into a connectivity-based targeting strategy for focal brain stimulation that might be used to optimize clinical response",

These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a "processing" system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex},

The four contrast mechanisms that contribute to the BOLD signal change, namely extravascular static and dynamic dephasing, intravascular T2-like changes, and the intravascular frequency offset effect are described in terms of their spatial localization and relative contributions to the BOLD signal. The current model of changes in blood flow being an indirect consequence of synaptic input to a region is presented. The second section of the article deals with the imaging characteristics of BOLD in terms of the attainable spatial resolution and linear system characteristics. In the third section, practical BOLD imaging is examined for choice of pulse sequence, resolution, echo time (TE), repetition time (TR), and flip angle. The final section touches on other MRI approaches that are relevant to cognitive neuroimaging, in particular the measurement of blood flow, blood volume, resting state fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and measures of connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging and fiber-tracking.",

Since these brain networks show gender differences when mediating emotional and cognitive tasks, we thus hypothesize that women and men may also respond differently to acupuncture procedure at these brain regions. In order to test this hypothesis, we retrieved the data of 38 subjects, 19 females and 19 males, who had brain fMRI during acupuncture from previous studies and reanalyzed them based on sex status. Deactivation at the LPNN/DMN during needle manipulation of acupuncture was more extensive in females than in males, particularly in the posterior cingulate (BA31), precuneus (BA7m) and angular gyrus (BA39). The functional correlations between the right BA31 and pregenual cingulate (BA32), hippocampus or contralateral BA31 were significantly stronger in females than in males. The angular gyrus (BA39) was functionally correlated with BA31 in females; in contrast, it was anticorrelated with BA31 in males. Soreness, a major component of the psychophysical responses to needle manipulation, deqi, was correlated in intensity with deactivation of the angular gyrus in females; no such relationships were observed in males. In contrast to lesser deactivation at the LPNN/DMN networks, needle manipulation during acupuncture induced greater activation at the secondary somatosensory cortex and stronger functional connectivity with the anterior-middle cingulate (BA32/24) in males than in females. Our study suggests that brains with sex dimorphism may process the acupuncture stimulation differently between women and men",

    abstract = "Characterizing interactions between multiple brain regions is important for understanding brain function. Functional connectivity measures based on partial correlation provide an estimate of the linear conditional dependence between brain regions after removing the linear influence of other regions. Estimation of partial correlations is, however, difficult when the number of regions is large, as is now increasingly the case with a growing number of large-scale brain connectivity studies. To address this problem, we develop novel methods for estimating sparse partial correlations between multiple regions in fMRI data using elastic net penalty (SPC-EN), which combines L1- and L2-norm regularization We show that L1-norm regularization in SPC-EN provides sparse interpretable solutions while L2-norm regularization improves the sensitivity of the method when the number of possible connections between regions is larger than the number of time points, and when pair-wise correlations between brain regions are high. An issue with regularization-based methods is choosing the regularization parameters which in turn determine the selection of connections between brain regions. To address this problem, we deploy novel stability selection methods to infer significant connections between brain regions. We also compare the performance of SPC-EN with existing methods which use only L1-norm regularization (SPC-L1) on simulated and experimental datasets. Detailed simulations show that the performance of SPC-EN, measured in terms of sensitivity and accuracy is superior to SPC-L1, especially at higher rates of feature prevalence. Application of our methods to resting-state fMRI data obtained from 22 healthy adults shows that SPC-EN reveals a modular architecture characterized by strong inter-hemispheric links, distinct ventral and dorsal stream pathways, and a major hub in the posterior medial cortex - features that were missed by conventional methods. Taken together, our findings suggest that SPC-EN provides a powerful tool for characterizing connectivity involving a large number of correlated regions that span the entire brain",

It is hypothesized that these abnormalities are based on altered connectivity within "shared" neural networks involved in emotional awareness of self and others. The insula is considered a central brain region in a network underlying these functions, being located at the transition of information about bodily arousal and the physiological state of the body to subjective feelings. The present study investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity properties of the insula in 14 high-functioning participants with ASD (HF-ASD) and 15 typically developing (TD) participants in the age range between 12 and 20 years by means of "resting state" or "nontask" functional magnetic resonance imaging. Essentially, a distinction was made between anterior and posterior regions of the insular cortex. The results show a reduced functional connectivity in the HF-ASD group, compared with the TD group, between anterior as well as posterior insula and specific brain regions involved in emotional and sensory processing. It is suggested that functional abnormalities in a network involved in emotional and interoceptive awareness might be at the basis of altered emotional experiences and impaired social abilities in ASD, and that these abnormalities are partly based on the intrinsic functional connectivity properties of such a network.},

    abstract = "The brain is not a passive sensory-motor analyzer driven by environmental stimuli, but actively maintains ongoing representations that may be involved in the coding of expected sensory stimuli, prospective motor responses, and prior experience. Spontaneous cortical activity has been proposed to play an important part in maintaining these ongoing, internal representations, although its functional role is not well understood. One spontaneous signal being intensely investigated in the human brain is the interregional temporal correlation of the blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal recorded at rest by functional MRI (functional connectivity-by-MRI, fcMRI, or BOLD connectivity). This signal is intrinsic and coherent within a number of distributed networks whose topography closely resembles that of functional networks recruited during tasks. While it is apparent that fcMRI networks reflect anatomical connectivity, it is less clear whether they have any dynamic functional importance. Here, we demonstrate that visual perceptual learning, an example of adult neural plasticity, modifies the resting covariance structure of spontaneous activity between networks engaged by the task. Specifically, after intense training on a shape-identification task constrained to one visual quadrant, resting BOLD functional connectivity and directed mutual interaction between trained visual cortex and frontal-parietal areas involved in the control of spatial attention were significantly modified. Critically, these changes correlated with the degree of perceptual learning. We conclude that functional connectivity serves a dynamic role in brain function, supporting the consolidation of previous experience",

    abstract = "The primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in reward processing, learning, and decision making. Research in monkeys has shown that this region is densely connected with higher sensory, limbic, and subcortical regions. Moreover, a parcellation of the monkey OFC into two subdivisions has been suggested based on its intrinsic anatomical connections. However, in humans, little is known about any functional subdivisions of the OFC except for a rather coarse medial/lateral distinction. Here, we used resting-state fMRI in combination with unsupervised clustering techniques to investigate whether OFC subdivisions can be revealed based on their functional connectivity profiles with other brain regions. Examination of different cluster solutions provided support for a parcellation into two parts as observed in monkeys, but it also highlighted a much finer hierarchical clustering of the orbital surface. Specifically, we identified (1) a medial, (2) a posterior-central, (3) a central, and (4-6) three lateral clusters spanning the anterior-posterior gradient. Consistent with animal tracing studies, these OFC clusters were connected to other cortical regions such as prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices but also subcortical areas in the striatum and the midbrain. These connectivity patterns provide important implications for identifying specific functional roles of OFC subdivisions for reward processing, learning, and decision making. Moreover, this parcellation schema can provide guidance to report results in future studies",

    abstract = "Until recently, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was most often negative in Parkinson's disease or showed nonspecific findings. Recent developments in structural MRI, including relaxometry, magnetization transfer, and neuromelanin imaging, have demonstrated improved contrast and enabled more accurate visualization of deep brain nuclei, in particular, the substantia nigra. Meanwhile, diffusion imaging has provided useful biomarkers of substantia nigra degeneration, showing reduced anisotropy and anatomical connectivity with the striatum and thalamus. These advances in structural imaging are complemented by findings of magnetic resonance spectroscopy on brain metabolism and resting-state functional MRI on functional connectivity. This article presents an overview of these new structural, metabolic, and resting-state functional MRI techniques and their implications for Parkinson's disease. The techniques are reviewed in the context of their potential for better understanding the disease in terms of diagnosis and pathophysiology and as biomarkers of its progression. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society",

Slow-wave and fast-wave states were determined indirectly through monitoring of respiration rate, which was confirmed to co-vary with state as determined by electrophysiological recordings. Previous electrophysiological data have suggested that the piriform cortex shifts between responsiveness to afferent odor input during fast-wave states and enhanced functional connectivity with limbic areas during slow-wave state. The present results demonstrate that fMRI-based resting state functional connectivity between the piriform cortex and both limbic and neocortical areas is enhanced during slow-wave state compared to fast-wave state using respiration as an indirect measure of state in urethane anesthetized rats.

    abstract = "The majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) experience disturbances of episodic memory from structural damage or dysfunction of the hippocampus. The objective of this study was to use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to identify regions where resting state connectivity to the left hippocampus (LH) is correlated with neuropsychological measures of verbal memory retention in TLE patients. Eleven left TLE (LTLE) patients and 15 control subjects participated in resting state fMRI scans. All LTLE patients underwent neuropsychological testing. Resting state functional connectivity maps to the LH were calculated for each patient, and subsequently used in a multiple regression analysis with verbal memory retention scores as a covariate. The analysis identified brain regions whose connectivity to the LH was linearly related to memory retention scores across the group of patients. In LTLE patients, right sided (contralateral) clusters in the precuneus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) exhibited increased connectivity to the LH with increased memory retention score; left sided (ipsilateral) regions in the precuneus and IPL showed increased connectivity to the LH with decreased retention score. Patients with high memory retention scores had greater connectivity between the LH-right parietal clusters than between the LH-left parietal clusters; in contrast, control subjects had significantly and consistently greater LH-left hemisphere than LH-right hemisphere connectivity. Our results suggest that increased connectivity in contralateral hippocampal functional pathways within the episodic verbal memory network represents a strengthening of alternative pathways in LTLE patients with strong verbal memory retention abilities.

However, off-line hippocampal-cortical interactions have not been demonstrated to be linked with long-term memory. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if hippocampal-cortical BOLD correlations during rest following an associative encoding task are related to later associative memory performance. Our data show enhanced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a portion of the lateral occipital complex (LO) during rest following a task with high subsequent memory compared to pretask baseline resting connectivity. This effect is not seen during rest following a task with poor subsequent memory. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-LO correlations during posttask rest predicts individual differences in later associative memory. These results demonstrate the importance of postexperience resting brain correlations for memory for recent experiences",

In females only, greater ELS predicted increased childhood cortisol levels, which predicted decreased amygdala-vmPFC rs-FC 14 years later. For females, adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity was inversely correlated with concurrent anxiety symptoms but positively associated with depressive symptoms, suggesting differing pathways from childhood cortisol levels function through adolescent amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity to anxiety and depression.

    abstract = "Functional imaging experiments, in particular positron-emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging, can be analyzed either in psychological terms or on the basis of neuroscience. In the usual psychological interpretation, stimulations are designed to activate specific mental processes identified by cognitive psychology, which are then localized by the signals in functional imaging experiments. An alternate approach would be to analyze experiments in terms of the neurobiological processes responsible for the signals. Recent in vivo 13C NMR measurements of the glutamate-to-glutamine neurotransmitter cycling in rat and human brains facilitate a neuroscientific interpretation of functional imaging data in terms of neurobiological processes since incremental neurotransmitter flux showed a 1:1 stoichiometry with the incremental rate of glucose oxidation. Because functional imaging signals depend on brain energy consumption, a quantitative relationship can be established between the signal (S) and the specific neurochemical cerebral neurotransmitter activity (N) of glutamate-to-glutamine neurotransmitter cycling. The quantitation of neuronal activity proposed has implications for the psychological design and interpretation of functional imaging experiments. Measurements of the neurotransmitter cycling flux at rest in functional imaging experiments suggest that performing cognitive tasks and sensory stimulations increases neurotransmitter cycling by only 10-20\%. Therefore it cannot be assumed that reference state activities are negligible, nor that they are constant during stimulation.",

    abstract = "Teenagers are often impulsive. In some cases this is a phase of normal development; in other cases impulsivity contributes to criminal behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined resting-state functional connectivity among brain systems and behavioral measures of impulsivity in 107 juveniles incarcerated in a high-security facility. In less-impulsive juveniles and normal controls, motor planning regions were correlated with brain networks associated with spatial attention and executive control. In more-impulsive juveniles, these same regions correlated with the default-mode network, a constellation of brain areas associated with spontaneous, unconstrained, self-referential cognition. The strength of these brain-behavior relationships was sufficient to predict impulsivity scores at the individual level. Our data suggest that increased functional connectivity of motor-planning regions with networks subserving unconstrained, self-referential cognition, rather than those subserving executive control, heightens the predisposition to impulsive behavior in juvenile offenders. To further explore the relationship between impulsivity and neural development, we studied functional connectivity in the same motor-planning regions in 95 typically developing individuals across a wide age span. The change in functional connectivity with age mirrored that of impulsivity: younger subjects tended to exhibit functional connectivity similar to the more-impulsive incarcerated juveniles, whereas older subjects exhibited a less-impulsive pattern. This observation suggests that impulsivity in the offender population is a consequence of a delay in typical development, rather than a distinct abnormality.",

Because the PMC appears to be the most active region during resting state, it has been postulated to play a fundamental role in the control of baseline brain functioning within the default mode network (DMN). Therefore one goal of this study was to explore which components of the PMC are specifically involved in the DMN. In a sample of seventeen healthy volunteers, we performed an unsupervised voxelwise ROI-based clustering based on resting state functional connectivity. Our results showed four clusters with different network connectivity. Each cluster showed positive and negative correlations with cortical regions involved in the DMN. Progressive shifts in PMC functional connectivity emerged from anterior to posterior and from dorsal to ventral ROIs. Ventral posterior portions of PMC were found to be part of a network implicated in the visuo-spatial guidance of movements, whereas dorsal anterior portions of PMC were interlinked with areas involved in attentional control. Ventral retrosplenial PMC selectively correlated with a network showing considerable overlap with the DMN, indicating that it makes essential contributions in self-referential processing, including autobiographical memory processing. Finally, ventral posterior PMC was shown to be functionally connected with a visual network.The paper represents the first attempt to provide a systematic, unsupervised, voxelwise clustering of the human posteromedial cortex (PMC), using resting-state functional connectivity data.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deficits in social cognition, including impairments in self-awareness, contribute to the overall functional disability associated with schizophrenia. Studies in healthy subjects have shown that social cognitive functions, including self-reflection, rely on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate gyrus, and these regions exhibit highly correlated activity during "resting" states. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia show dysfunction of this network during self-reflection and that this abnormal activity is associated with changes in the strength of resting-state correlations between these regions.METHODS: Activation during self-reflection and control tasks was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 19 patients with schizophrenia and 20 demographically matched control subjects. In addition, the resting-state functional connectivity of midline cortical areas showing abnormal self-reflection-related activation in schizophrenia was measured.RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, the schizophrenia patients demonstrated lower activation of the right ventral mPFC and greater activation of the mid/posterior cingulate gyri bilaterally during self-reflection, relative to a control task. A similar pattern was seen during overall social reflection. In addition, functional connectivity between the portion of the left mid/posterior cingulate gyrus showing abnormally elevated activity during self-reflection in schizophrenia, and the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus was lower in the schizophrenia patients compared with control subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia is associated with an anterior-to-posterior shift in introspection-related activation, as well as changes in functional connectivity, of the midline cortex. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that aberrant midline cortical function contributes to social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.},

The level of delay discounting is a relatively stable psychological trait, and therefore neural processes implicated in delay discounting are likely to be based on the overall functional organization of the brain (under task-free conditions) in which state-dependent shifts from baseline levels occur. The current study investigated whether delay discounting can be predicted by intrinsic properties of brain functioning. Fourteen healthy male subjects performed a delay discounting task. In addition, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H MRS) were used to investigate the relationship between individual differences in delay discounting and molecular and regional measures of resting state (baseline) activity of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Results showed that delay discounting was associated with both dACC glutamate concentrations and resting state functional connectivity of the dACC with a midbrain region including ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra. In addition, a neural pathway was established, showing that the effect of glutamate concentrations in the dACC on delay discounting is mediated by functional connectivity of the dACC with the midbrain. The current findings are important to acknowledge because spontaneous intrinsic brain processes have been proposed to be a potential promising biomarker of disease and impulsive decision making is associated with several psychiatric disorders",

Levels of activity in the default-mode network (DMN) relative to the task-positive network (TPN), as well as activity in structures that influence DMN and TPN functioning, may represent important neural substrates of maladaptive and adaptive rumination in MDD.METHODS: We used a unique metric to estimate DMN dominance over TPN from blood oxygenation level-dependent data collected during eyes-closed rest in 17 currently depressed and 17 never-disordered adults. We calculated correlations between this metric of DMN dominance over TPN and the depressive, brooding, and reflective subscales of the Ruminative Responses Scale, correcting for associations between these measures both with one another and with severity of depression. Finally, we estimated and compared across groups right fronto-insular cortex (RFIC) response during initiations of ascent in DMN and in TPN activity.RESULTS: In the MDD participants, increasing levels of DMN dominance were associated with higher levels of maladaptive, depressive rumination and lower levels of adaptive, reflective rumination. Moreover, our RFIC state-change analysis showed increased RFIC activation in the MDD participants at the onset of increases in TPN activity; conversely, healthy control participants exhibited increased RFIC response at the onset of increases in DMN activity.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a formulation in which the DMN undergirds representation of negative, self-referential information in depression, and the RFIC, when prompted by increased levels of DMN activity, initiates an adaptive engagement of the TPN",

These changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration in venous vessels can also be monitored using a high-resolution susceptibility-based MR-venography technique. Four volunteers participated in the study in which functional MR-venograms were compared with conventional echo-planar imaging (EPI)-BOLD-fMRI. In all cases, small venous vessels could be identified close to the areas of activation detected by conventional fMRI. In the venograms, task performance (finger tapping) resulted in a loss of venous vessel contrast compared to the resting state, which is consistent with a local decrease of deoxyhemoglobin concentration. MR-venography allows a direct visualization of the BOLD-effect at high spatial resolution. In combination with conventional fMRI, this technique may help to separate the contribution of brain parenchyma and venous vessels in fMRI studies.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the alteration of resting-state functional connectivity of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in the heroin abusers' brain. METHODS: Fifteen heroin abusers and fifteen matched healthy volunteers were studied using vACC as the region-of interest (ROI) seed. A 3.0 T scanner with a standard head coil was the imagining apparatus. T2*-weighted gradient-echo planar imaging (GRE-EPI) was the scanning protocol. A ROI seed based correlation analysis used a SPM5 software package as the tool for all images processing. RESULTS: This study showed a functional connection to the insula vACC in heroin abusers. Compared with controls, heroin users showed decreased functional connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and vACC, between the parahippocampala gyrus/amgdala (PHC/amygdala) and vACC, between the thalamus and vACC, and between the posterior cingulated cortex/precuneus (PCC/pC) and vACC. CONCLUSION: The altered resting-state functional connectivity to the vACC suggests the neural circuitry on which the addictive drug has an affect and reflects the dysfunction of the addictive brain.",

At the group level, using electroencephalography-correlated functional magnetic resonance imaging in 19 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy, we found common decreases of resting state activity in 9 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) but not in 10 patients with extra-TLE. We infer that the functional consequences of TLE interictal epileptic discharges are different from those in extra-TLE and affect ongoing brain function. Activity increases were detected in the ipsilateral hippocampus in patients with TLE, and in subthalamic, bilateral superior temporal and medial frontal brain regions in patients with extra-TLE, possibly indicating effects of different interictal epileptic discharge propagation",

During post-training rest, this same area reactivated. We also found a link between parietal reactivation and learning. Activity in superior parietal cortex was associated with learning during training, and a control group that did not train on the perceptuomotor task did not show any difference between the pre- and post-training rest blocks in this region. These findings indicate that, during rest, reactivation also occurs in humans. This process may contribute to consolidation of perceptuomotor memories.",

Schizophrenia Bulletin 33, 1004-1012] of resting state connectivity in schizophrenia by examining alterations in connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex. We have previously demonstrated altered connectivity of the posterior cingulate/precuneus, particularly with other regions of the "default network" (which includes the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral lateral parietal cortex). It was hypothesized that the retrosplenial cortex would show aberrant patterns of connectivity with regions of the default network and regions associated with memory. Patients with schizophrenia (N=17) and healthy controls (N=17) underwent a 5.5-min resting functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Lower correlations were observed in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy controls between the retrosplenial cortex and both the temporal lobe and regions of the default network. In patients with schizophrenia, activity in the retrosplenial cortex correlated negatively with activity in bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus/medial prefrontal cortex (BA 32/10), despite the fact that these regions, as part of the default network, were expected to show positive correlations in activity. Connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex was greater in patients with more positive symptoms with areas previously associated with hallucinations, particularly the left superior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that spontaneous activity in the retrosplenial cortex during rest is altered in patients with schizophrenia. These alterations may help to explain alterations in self-oriented processing in this patient population},

    abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to study the functional connectivity in the somatosensory system. However, the relationship between sensory network connectivity, sensory deficits, and structural abnormality remains poorly understood. Previously, we investigated the motor network in children with congenital hemiparesis due to middle cerebral artery strokes (MCA, n = 6) or periventricular lesions (PL, n = 8). In the present study, we validate the use of interleaved resting-state data from blocked fMRI designs to investigate the somatosensory network in these patients. The approach was validated by assessing the predicted "crossed-over" connectivity between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. Furthermore, the impact on the volume of gray-matter (GM) in primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex on functional connectivity measures was investigated. We were able to replicate the well-known "crossed-over" pattern of functional connectivity between cerebral and cerebellar cortex. The MCA group displayed more sensory deficit and significantly reduced functional connectivity in the lesioned S2 (but not in lesioned S1) when compared with the PL group. However, when accounting for GM volume loss, this difference disappeared. This study demonstrates the applicability of analyzing resting-state connectivity in patients with brain lesions. Reductions of functional connectivity within the somatosensory network were associated with sensory deficits, but were fully explained by the underlying GM damage},

    abstract = "A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.",

METHODS: Functional magnetic resonanc image (fMRI) was performed in 19 IAD college students and 19 controls under resting state. ReHo method was used to analyze the differences between the average ReHo in two groups. RESULTS: The following increased ReHo brain regions were found in IAD group compared with control group: cerebellum, brainstem, right cingulate gyrus, bilateral parahippocampus, right frontal lobe (rectal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus), left superior frontal gyrus, left precuneus, right postcentral gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. The decreased ReHo brain regions were not found in the IAD group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: There are abnormalities in regional homogeneity in IAD college students compared with the controls and enhancement of synchronization in most encephalic regions can be found. The results reflect the functional change of brain in IAD college students. The connections between the enhancement of synchronization among cerebellum, brainstem, limbic lobe, frontal lobe and apical lobe may be relative to reward pathways.",

Within gray matter, the largest amplitudes appeared along mid-brain structures associated with the "default-mode" network. Additionally, we found that high-amplitude LFO activity in specific brain regions was reliable across time. Furthermore, parcellation-based results revealed significant and highly reliable ranking orders of LFO amplitudes among anatomical parcellation units. Detailed examination of individual low frequency bands showed distinct spatial profiles. Intriguingly, LFO amplitudes in the slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) band, as defined by Buzs\'{a}ki et al., were most robust in the basal ganglia, as has been found in spontaneous electrophysiological recordings in the awake rat.

This work aims to identify brain substrates that can distinguish this group of patients from their cocaine-negative counterparts in order to better understand this clinical phenotype. Going a step beyond conventional functional connectivity, we used wavelet transform coherence (WTC) to determine in which ways the temporal pattern of fMRI cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals during attempted inhibition of cue-induced cocaine craving may differ between these two groups. METHODS: Using a critical node in motivational circuitry, amygdala, as a seed, whole brain correlations for the entire sample revealed a functional connection with the dorsal cingulate. Next, WTC maps of CBF were constructed for each individual, characterizing the temporal patterns between these two regions during craving inhibition. RESULTS: As revealed by WTC, during attempted craving inhibition, the cocaine-negative subjects had significantly stronger and longer negative coherence between the amygdala and the dorsal cingulate, as compared to the cocaine-positive subjects. This relationship was neither evident in the resting state nor between two regions unrelated to inhibition processes. CONCLUSIONS: The duration and strength of negative coherence calculated from wavelet-transformed CBF provide an objective and well-defined way to characterize brain responses during attempted inhibition of cue-induced craving, at the level of the individual. The stronger and sustained negative coherence in CBF between motivational (amygdala) and modulatory (dorsal cingulate) regions in cocaine-negative subjects may be a critical brain strength that fosters improved craving inhibition and thus, better clinical outcome",

To avoid interictal epileptic discharge effects, testing was performed within interictal durations when there were no interictal epileptic discharges. Cross-correlation functional connectivity analysis with seed at posterior cingulate cortex, as well as region-wise calculation in DMN, revealed decreased integration within DMN in the absence epilepsy patients. Region-wise functional connectivity among the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe was significantly decreased in the patient group. Moreover, functional connectivity between the frontal and parietal lobe revealed a significant negative correlation with epilepsy duration. These findings indicated DMN abnormalities in patients with absence epilepsy, even during resting interictal durations without interictal epileptic discharges. Abnormal functional connectivity in absence epilepsy may reflect abnormal anatomo-functional architectural integration in DMN, as a result of cognitive mental impairment and unconsciousness during absence seizure.",

RSN were defined on the basis of signal changes correlated with that of a "seed" voxel in the primary sensorimotor cortex. We found a generally close spatial correspondence between clusters of correlated BOLD signal change in RSN and activation maxima associated with hand movement. Conventional BOLD fMRI during active hand movement showed the expected wide variation in relative hemispheric lateralisation of LI for sensorimotor cortex across the subjects.

    abstract = "Graph-based computational network analysis has proven a powerful tool to quantitatively characterize functional architectures of the brain. However, the test-retest (TRT) reliability of graph metrics of functional networks has not been systematically examined. Here, we investigated TRT reliability of topological metrics of functional brain networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Specifically, we evaluated both short-term (<1 hour apart) and long-term (>5 months apart) TRT reliability for 12 global and 6 local nodal network metrics. We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, threshold-sensitive and dependent on several factors of scanning time interval (TI, long-term>short-term), network membership (NM, networks excluding negative correlations>networks including negative correlations) and network type (NT, binarized networks>weighted networks). The dependence was modulated by another factor of node definition (ND) strategy. The local nodal reliability exhibited large variability across nodal metrics and a spatially heterogeneous distribution. Nodal degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors above. Hub regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability. Importantly, nodal reliability was robust to above-mentioned four factors. Simulation analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying degrees) to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated numerically more reliable results in compared with binarized networks. For nodal network metrics, they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no NT related differences were found in the resistance. These findings provide important implications on how to choose reliable analytical schemes and network metrics of interest.",

We found that as cognitive load increases, the functional connectivity within both the working memory the default mode network increases. To test whether functional connectivity between the working memory and the default mode networks changed, we constructed maps of functional connectivity to the working memory network as a whole and found that increasingly negative correlations emerged in a dorsal region of the posterior cingulate cortex.

    abstract = "Resting-state fMRI has become a powerful tool for studying network mechanisms of normal brain functioning and its impairments by neurological and psychiatric disorders. Analytically, independent component analysis and seed-based cross correlation are the main methods for assessing the connectivity of resting-state fMRI time series. A feature common to both methods is that they exploit the covariation structures of contemporaneously (zero-lag) measured data but ignore temporal relations that extend beyond the zero-lag. To examine whether data covariations across different lags can contribute to our understanding of functional brain networks, a measure that can uncover the overall temporal relationship between two resting-state BOLD signals is needed. In this paper we propose such a measure referred as total interdependence (TI). Comparing TI with zero-lag cross correlation (CC) we report three results. First, when combined with a random permutation procedure, TI can reveal the amount of temporal relationship between two resting-state BOLD time series that is not captured by CC. Second, comparing resting-state data with task-state data recorded in the same scanning session, we demonstrate that the resting-state functional networks constructed with TI match more precisely the networks activated by the task. Third, TI is shown to be more statistically sensitive than CC and provides better feature vectors for network clustering analysis",

The purpose of the current study was to examine the DLPFC functional connectivity patterns during rest in MCI patients and the impact of regional grey matter (GM) atrophy on the functional results. Structural and functional MRI data were collected from 14 MCI patients and 14 age, gender-matched healthy controls. We found that both the bilateral DLPFC showed reduced functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), superior/medial frontal gyrus and sub-cortical regions (e.g., thalamus, putamen) in MCI patients when compared with healthy controls. Moreover, the DLPFC connectivity with the IPL and thalamus significantly correlated with the cognitive performance of patients as measured by mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test (CDT), and California verbal learning test (CVLT) scores. When taking GM atrophy as covariates, these results were approximately consistent with those without correction, although there may be a decrease in the statistical power. These results suggest that the DLPFC disconnections may be the substrates of cognitive impairments in MCI patients. In addition, we also found enhanced functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and the right prefrontal cortex in MCI patients. This is consistent with previous findings of MCI-related increased activation during cognitive tasks, and may represent a compensatory mechanism in MCI patients. Together, the present study demonstrated the coexistence of functional disconnection and compensation in MCI patients using DLPFC functional connectivity analysis, and thus might provide insights into biological mechanism of the disease.",

Furthermore, breakdown of activity coherence at rest, even in regions of the brain that are structurally intact, correlates with behavioral deficits and their recovery after injury. Breakdown of functional connectivity appears to occur not just after local injury but also in other conditions that affect large-scale neural communication.SUMMARY: A network perspective is fundamental to appreciating the pathophysiology of brain injury at the systems level and the underlying mechanisms of recovery, and for developing novel strategies of rehabilitation",

Previous studies have suggested that the abnormal brain activity may happen not only during performance of self-initiated movements but also in the before movement (baseline or resting) state. In the current study, we investigated the functional connectivity of brain networks in the resting state in PD. We chose the rostral supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) as "seed" regions, because the pre-SMA is important in motor preparation, whereas the M1 is critical in motor execution. FMRIs were acquired in 18 patients and 18 matched controls. We found that in the resting state, the pattern of connectivity with both the pre-SMA or the M1 was changed in PD. Connectivity with the pre-SMA in patients with PD compared to normal subjects was increased connectivity to the right M1 and decreased to the left putamen, right insula, right premotor cortex, and left inferior parietal lobule. We only found stronger connectivity in the M1 with its own local region in patients with PD compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate that the interactions of brain networks are abnormal in PD in the resting state. There are more connectivity changes of networks related to motor preparation and initiation than to networks of motor execution in PD. We postulate that these disrupted connections indicate a lack of readiness for movement and may be partly responsible for difficulty in initiating movements in PD},

    abstract = {It is suggested that resting state networks reflecting correlated neural regional activities participate significantly in brain functioning. A fundamental issue is to understand how these networks interact and how their activities change during behavioral transitions. Our aim was to understand better with functional MRI connectivity how the brain switched from a "resting" to a movement-related state by exploring the transitory readiness state for an intended movement of the right hand. Our study does not address movement preparation occurring in a time scale of milliseconds before movement which has been widely studied but movement-readiness which can last longer. At rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, a "default-mode" network, whose main areas are the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC/Pcu), shows high activity interpreted as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. We found that, during rest, the "default-mode" network and the sensorimotor network were not functionally correlated. During movement-readiness, the two networks were functionally correlated through an interaction between the PCC/Pcu and the medial superior parietal cortex in the upper precuneus. The complex PCC/Pcu has been shown to be involved in retrieval and/or setting up spatial attributes for motor imagery, and thus, would be a key region in the movement-readiness phase. It might functionally connect to the medial superior parietal cortex to initiate the movement programming through retrieval of suited movement parameters. The anterior cingulum, functionally correlated to the primary sensorimotor cortex during movement-readiness would have a motivational role or could generate predictions about the movement},

In extension to the seminal paper by Biswal et al.

This, along with the possibility of using datasets of different lengths without truncation, enabled us to benefit from the full dataset available, thereby obtaining 16 networks consistent over the whole group of 1000 subjects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the most consistent among these networks at both subject and study level matched networks most often reported in the literature, and found additional components emerging in prefrontal and parietal areas.

Few studies of the neural bases of depression, however, have used analytical techniques that are capable of testing network-level hypotheses of neural dysfunction in this disorder. Moreover, of those that have, fewer still have attempted to determine the directionality of influence within functionally abnormal networks of structures. We used multivariate GC analysis, a technique that estimates the extent to which preceding neural activity in one or more seed regions predicts subsequent activity in target brain regions, to analyze blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data collected during eyes-closed rest from depressed and never-depressed persons. We found that activation in the hippocampus predicted subsequent increases in ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activity in depression, and that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and vACC were mutually reinforcing in MDD. Hippocampal and vACC activation in depressed participants predicted subsequent decreases in dorsal cortical activity. This study shows that, on a moment-by-moment basis, there is increased excitatory activity among limbic and paralimbic structures, as well as increased inhibition in the activity of dorsal cortical structures, by limbic structures in depression; these aberrant patterns of effective connectivity implicate disturbances in the mesostriatal dopamine system in depression. These findings advance the neural theory of depression by detailing specific patterns of limbic excitation in MDD, by making explicit the primary role of limbic inhibition of dorsal cortex in the cortico-limbic relation posited to underlie depression, and by presenting an integrated neurofunctional account of altered dopamine function in this disorder.",

These deactivations occur in the so-called default mode network (DMN). In parallel a growing number of studies focused on spontaneous, ongoing 'baseline' activity in the DMN. These resting state fMRI studies explored the functional connectivity in the DMN. Here we review whether normal aging and dementia affect task-induced deactivation and functional connectivity in the DMN. The majority of studies show a decreased DMN functional connectivity and task-induced DMN deactivations along a continuum from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even subjects at risk for developing AD, either in terms of having amyloid plaques or carrying the APOE4 allele, showed disruptions in the DMN. While fMRI is a useful tool for detecting changes in DMN functional connectivity and deactivation, more work needs to be conducted to conclude whether these measures will become useful as a clinical diagnostic tool in AD.

We compare the spatial maps from five commonly identified functional networks and show that physiologic noise correction techniques introduce significant changes in the spatial ICA decomposition of all five networks, greater than the changes introduced by either algorithmic indeterminacy (re-running ICA) or the changes introduced by decreasing the decomposition dimensionality due to physiologic noise removal. In addition, we demonstrate that the sources associated with these components have significant temporal correlation to parallel measures of cardiac and respiratory rates, and these are reduced after correction. We conclude that ICA decomposition is significantly affected by physiologic noise and the ICA process alone is not sufficient to separate physiologic noise effects in the brain.

Self-reference is typically reduced in schizophrenia as a disorder of the self while extensive self-attribution of, eg, negative thoughts is characteristic for major depression. However, a quantitative meta-analysis targeting the resting-state brain activity in both disorders is lacking. Here, we predict primarily abnormal resting-state activity in brain regions related to self-referential processing. By means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) on functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies, we investigated concurrence of hyperactivation and hypoactivation in resting-state measurements of schizophrenic and depressed patients compared with healthy controls. We found hypoactivation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex, lower precueus and the precuneus, and hyperactivation in bilateral lingual gyrus of schizophrenic patients. In major depression, we found hyperactivation in vmPFC, left ventral striatum, and left thalamus and hypoactivation in left postcentral gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, and left insula. An overall ALE analysis confirmed the proximity of hypoactivation in schizophrenia and hyperactivation in major depression in the vmPFC.The opposing resting-state activity in vmPFC for the 2 disorders is in line with the different expression of dysfunctional self-reference as core characteristics of schizophrenia and major depression. The vmPFC has previously been identified as a crucial area for self-referential processing and may represent a target to increase the diagnostic validity of resting-state activity for disorders with dysfunctions of the self.",

In this study, we measured resting state activity using fMRI and explored whether cognitive decline with aging is related to disrupted resting state networks. Independent component analysis was used to evaluate functional connectivity. Notably, the connectivity within the salience network that consisted of the bilateral insula and the anterior cingulated cortex decreased with aging; the impairment of functional connectivity was correlated with measured decreases in individual cognitive abilities. Furthermore, certain internetwork connectivities (e.g., salience to auditory, default mode to visual, etc.) also decreased with aging. These results suggest that (1) aging affects not only the default mode network but also other networks, specifically the salience network; (2) aging affects internetwork connectivity; and (3) disruption of the salience network is related to cognitive decline in elderly people",

    title = "{Determining functional connectivity using fMRI data with diffusion-based anatomical weighting.}",
    abstract = "There is strong interest in investigating both functional connectivity (FC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural connectivity (SC) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). There is also emerging evidence of correspondence between functional and structural pathways within many networks (Greicius, et al., 2009; Skudlarski et al., 2008; van den Heuvel et al., 2009), although some regions without SC exhibit strong FC (Honey et al., 2008). These findings suggest that FC may be mediated by (direct or indirect) anatomical connections, offering an opportunity to supplement fMRI data with DTI data when determining FC. We develop a novel statistical method for determining FC, called anatomically weighted FC (awFC), which combines fMRI and DTI data. Our awFC approach implements a hierarchical clustering algorithm that establishes neural processing networks using a new distance measure consisting of two components, a primary functional component that captures correlations between fMRI signals from different regions and a secondary anatomical weight reflecting probabilities of SC. The awFC approach defaults to conventional unweighted clustering for specific parameter settings. We optimize awFC parameters using a strictly functional criterion, therefore our approach will generally perform at least as well as an unweighted analysis, with respect to intracluster coherence or autocorrelation. AwFC also yields more informative results since it provides structural properties associated with identified functional networks. We apply awFC to two fMRI data sets: resting-state data from 6 healthy subjects and data from 17 subjects performing an auditory task. In these examples, awFC leads to more highly autocorrelated networks than a conventional analysis. We also conduct a simulation study, which demonstrates accurate performance of awFC and confirms that awFC generally yields comparable, if not superior, accuracy relative to a standard approach",

    abstract = "CONTEXT: Most of what we know about antipsychotic drug effects is at the receptor level, distal from the neural system effects that mediate their clinical efficacy. Studying cerebral function in antipsychotic-naive patients with schizophrenia before and after pharmacotherapy can enhance understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of these clinically effective treatments.OBJECTIVE: To examine alterations of regional and neural network function in antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia before and after treatment with second-generation antipsychotic medication.DESIGN: Case-control study.SETTING: Huaxi MR Research Center and Mental Health Centre of the West China Hospital.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia were scanned using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging while in a resting state. After 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment, patients were rescanned. Thirty-four matched healthy control subjects were studied at baseline for comparison purposes.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of blood oxygen level-dependent signals, believed to reflect spontaneous neural activity, was used to characterize regional cerebral function. Functional connectivity across brain regions was evaluated using a seed voxel correlation approach and an independent component analysis. Changes in these measures after treatment were examined to characterize effects of antipsychotic drugs on regional function and functional integration.RESULTS: After short-term treatment with second-generation antipsychotic medications, patients showed increased ALFF, particularly in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, left superior temporal cortex, and right caudate nucleus. Increased regional ALFF was associated with a reduction of clinical symptoms, and a widespread attenuation in functional connectivity was observed that was correlated with increased regional ALFF.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that widespread increased regional synchronous neural activity occurs after antipsychotic therapy, accompanied by decreased integration of function across widely distributed neural networks. These findings contribute to the understanding of the complex systems-level effects of antipsychotic drugs.",

Research consistently shows that nicotine transiently improves multiple cognitive functions. However, using nicotine replacement to treat nicotine addiction yields generally inconsistent results. Although this dichotomy is well known, the reasons are unclear. Imaging studies showed that nicotine challenges almost always involve the cingulate cortex, suggesting that this locus may be a key region associated with nicotine addiction and its treatment.OBJECTIVE:To identify cingulate functional circuits that are associated with the severity of nicotine addiction and study how nicotine affects them by means of region-specific resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.DESIGN:Double-blind, placebo-controlled study.SETTING:Outpatient clinics.PARTICIPANTS:Nineteen healthy smokers.INTERVENTION:Single-dose (21- or 35-mg) nicotine patch.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Correlation of nicotine addiction severity and cingulate resting-state functional connectivity, and effects of short-term nicotine administration on connectivity strength.RESULTS:Clearly separated pathways that correlated with nicotine addiction vs nicotine's action were found. The severity of nicotine addiction was associated with the strength of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-striatal circuits, which were not modified by nicotine patch administration. In contrast, short-term nicotine administration enhanced cingulate-neocortical functional connectivity patterns, which may play a role in nicotine's cognition-enhancing properties.CONCLUSIONS:Resting-state dACC-striatum functional connectivity may serve as a circuit-level biomarker for nicotine addiction, and the development of new therapeutic agents aiming to enhance the dACC-striatum functional pathways may be effective for nicotine addiction treatment.",

    abstract = "BACKGROUND: Pathophysiological models of bipolar disorder postulate that mood dysregulation arises from fronto-limbic dysfunction, marked by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory control. This might occur due to both disruptions within PFC networks and abnormal inhibition over subcortical structures involved in emotional processing. However, no study has examined global PFC dysconnectivity in bipolar disorder and tested whether regions with within-PFC dysconnectivity also exhibit fronto-limbic connectivity deficits. Furthermore, no study has investigated whether such connectivity disruptions differ for bipolar patients with psychosis history, who might exhibit a more severe clinical course. METHODS: We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3T in 68 remitted bipolar I patients (34 with psychosis history) and 51 demographically matched healthy participants. We employed a recently developed global brain connectivity method, restricted to PFC (rGBC). We also independently tested connectivity between anatomically defined amygdala and PFC. RESULTS: Bipolar patients exhibited reduced medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) rGBC, increased amygdala-mPFC connectivity, and reduced connectivity between amygdala and dorsolateral PFC. All effects were driven by psychosis history. Moreover, the magnitude of observed effects was significantly associated with lifetime psychotic symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: This convergence between rGBC, seed-based amygdala findings, and symptom severity analyses highlights that mPFC, a core emotion regulation region, exhibits both within-PFC dysconnectivity and connectivity abnormalities with limbic structures in bipolar illness. Furthermore, lateral PFC dysconnectivity in patients with psychosis history converges with published work in schizophrenia, indicating possible shared risk factors. Observed dysconnectivity in remitted patients suggests a bipolar trait characteristic and might constitute a risk factor for phasic features of the disorder",

    abstract = "Synchronized low-frequency BOLD fluctuations are observed in dissociable large-scale, distributed networks with functional specialization. Two such networks, referred to as the task-positive network (TPN) and the task-negative network (TNN) because they tend to be active or inactive during cognitively demanding tasks, show reproducible anticorrelation of resting BOLD fluctuations after removal of the global brain signal. Because global signal regression mandates that anticorrelated regions to a given seed region must exist, it is unclear whether such anticorrelations are an artifact of global regression or an intrinsic property of neural activity. In this study, we demonstrate from simulated data that spurious anticorrelations are introduced during global regression for any two networks as a linear function of their size. Using actual resting state data, we also show that both the TPN and TNN become anticorrelated with the orbits when soft tissues are included in the global regression algorithm. Finally, we propose a technique using phase-shifted soft tissue regression (PSTCor) that allows improved correction of global physiological artifacts without global regression that shows improved anatomic specificity to global regression but does not show significant network anticorrelations. These results imply that observed anticorrelations between TNN and TPN may be largely or entirely artifactual in the resting state. These results also imply that differences in network anticorrelations attributed to pathophysiological or behavioral states may be due to differences in network size or recruitment rather than actual anticorrelations.",

The two genotype groups had no psychiatric illness and were similar in age, gender, and personality scores.RESULTS:Compared with the l/l group, the s/s group showed significantly increased resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the amygdala and decreased CBF in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The effect of functional modulation in these regions by 5-HTTLPR genotype cannot be accounted for by variations in brain anatomy, personality, or self-reported mood.CONCLUSIONS:The 5-HTTLPR genotype alters resting brain function in emotion-related regions in healthy individuals, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

The frontoparietal control network has been proposed to mediate the transition between external and internal attention by coupling its activity to either the dorsal attention network or the default mode network, depending on the attentional demand. Dopamine is hypothesized to modulate attention and has been linked to the integrity of these three attention-related networks. We used PET with 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-m-tyrosine to quantify dopamine synthesis capacity in vivo and fMRI to acquire stimulus-independent brain activity in cognitively healthy human subjects. We found that in the resting state where internal cognition dominates, dopamine enhances the coupling between the frontoparietal control network and the default mode network while reducing the coupling between the frontoparietal control network and the dorsal attention network. These results add a neurochemical perspective to the role of network interaction in modulating attention",

However, one limitation of current methods for analysis of interregional correlations is that they rely on transformation of functional data to an atlas volume (e.g., Talairach-Tournoux or Montreal Neurological Institute atlases) and may not adequately account for anatomic variation between subjects, particularly in the presence of atrophy.

Group-level quantitative analysis was accomplished by comparing correlations between equivalent structures in different subjects.

A modified Stroop task with Chinese characters was used as the target stimulus. Statistical Parametric Mapping 99 software was employed to process the functional data. Individual maps and group data were generated for patients with hepatic cirrhosis and for healthy controls, respectively. Intergroup analysis between patients and healthy controls was also generated using the two-sample t-test model. Cluster analyses were done based on the group data, and an identical P value < or =0.01 with continuously connected voxels of no less than 10 was defined as significant deactivation. After fMRI scanning was complete, behavioral Stroop interference tests were performed on all subjects; reaction time and error number were recorded.RESULTS: Functionally, deactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus was absent when subjects performed the incongruous word-reading task; deactivation of the PCC, precuneus, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex was increased when they performed the incongruous color-naming task.CONCLUSION: The functional as well as behavioral data suggest that cirrhotic patients may have an abnormal deactivation mode. The absence of deactivation in the PCC and precuneus may be a sensitive rather than specific marker in patients with hepatic cirrhosis",

On the one hand, increased functional connectivity has been shown immediately after a training session; on the other hand, training-induced structural changes are visible only after several weeks. Based on known associations between functional and structural network development during human ontogeny, we hypothesised that learning a challenging motor task leads to long-lasting changes in functional resting-state networks and the corresponding cortical and sub-cortical brain structures. Using longitudinal functional and structural MRI at multiple time points, we demonstrate increased fronto-parietal network connectivity one week after two brief motor training sessions in a dynamic balancing task, although subjects were engaged in their regular daily activities during the week. Repeated training sessions over six consecutive weeks progressively modulate these changes in accordance with individual performance improvements. Multimodal correlation analyses showed an association between structural grey matter alterations and functional connectivity changes in prefrontal and supplementary-motor areas. These coincident changes were most prominent in the first three weeks of training. In contrast, changes in fronto-parietal functional connectivity and the underlying white matter fibre structure developed gradually during the six weeks. Our results demonstrate a tight correlation between training-induced functional and structural brain plasticity on the systems level and suggest a functional relevance of intrinsic brain activity for morphological adaptation in the human brain",

To test whether performance would be related to DMN integrity, we examined DMN functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and graph theory analysis. We assumed that disruption of short paths between network nodes would attenuate processing efficiency. Alcoholics and controls were scanned at rest and during a spatial working memory task. At rest, the spontaneous slow fluctuations of fMRI signals in the posterior cingulate and cerebellar regions in alcoholics were less synchronized than in controls, indicative of compromised functional connectivity. Graph theory analysis indicated that during rest, alcoholics had significantly lower efficiency indices than controls between the posterior cingulate seed and multiple cerebellar sites. Greater efficiency in several connections correlated with longer sobriety in alcoholics. During the task, on which alcoholics performed on par with controls, connectivity between the left posterior cingulate seed and left cerebellar regions was more robust in alcoholics than controls and suggests compensatory networking to achieve normal performance",

Connectivity maps were computed for each voxel in the insula based on resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data and segregated using cluster analysis. We identified 3 insular subregions with distinct patterns of connectivity: a posterior region, functionally connected with primary and secondary somatomotor cortices; a dorsal anterior to middle region, connected with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, along with other regions of a previously described control network; and a ventral anterior region, primarily connected with pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Applying these regions to a separate task data set, we found that dorsal and ventral anterior insula responded selectively to disgusting images, while posterior insula did not. These results demonstrate that clustering of connectivity patterns can be used to subdivide cerebral cortex into anatomically and functionally meaningful subregions; the insular regions identified here should be useful in future investigations on the function of the insula.",

Relatively low spatial consistency was found in the basal ganglia, a parietal region of left frontoparietal network, and the supplementary motor area. The functional connectivity between two independent components, the bilateral angular/supramarginal gyri/intraparietal lobule and bilateral middle temporal/occipital gyri, was decreased across time regardless of the correlation analysis method employed, (Pearson's or partial correlation).CONCLUSION: RSICs showing variable consistency are different between spatial characteristics and functional connectivity. To understand the brain as a dynamic network, we recommend further investigation of both changes in the activation of specific regions and the modulation of functional connectivity in the brain network",

    abstract = "A fMRI connectivity analysis approach combining principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis is proposed to detect functional connectivity between the brain regions. By first using PCA to identify clusters within the vectors of fMRI time series, more energy and information features in the signal can be maintained than using averaged values from brain regions of interest. Then, regression analysis can be applied to the extracted principal components in order to further investigate functional connectivity. Finally, t-test is applied and the patterns with t-values lager than a threshold are considered as functional connectivity mappings. The validity and reliability of the presented method were demonstrated with both simulated data and human fMRI data obtained during behavioral task and resting state. Compared to the conventional functional connectivity methods such as average signal based correlation analysis, independent component analysis (ICA) and PCA, the proposed method achieves competitive performance with greater accuracy and true positive rate (TPR). Furthermore, the 'default mode' and motor network results of resting-state fMRI data indicate that using PCA may improve upon application of existing regression analysis methods in study of human brain functional connectivity",

    abstract = {Nicotine-induced attentional enhancement is of potential therapeutic value. To investigate the precise attentional function(s) affected and their neuronal mechanisms, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study used an attention task in which subjects responded to stimuli of high (INT(high)) or low intensity presented randomly in one of four peripheral locations. Central cues of varying precision predicted the target location. In some trials, the cue was not followed by a target, allowing separate analysis of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to cue. Minimally deprived smokers underwent fast event-related fMRI twice: once with a nicotine patch (21 mg) and once with a placebo patch. Matched nonsmokers were scanned twice without a patch. Behaviorally, nicotine reduced omission errors and reaction time (RT) of valid and invalid cue trials and intra-individual variability of RT and did so preferentially in trials with INT(high). The BOLD signal related to cue-only trials, regardless of cue precision, demonstrated nicotine-induced deactivation in anterior and posterior cingulate, angular gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and cuneus. These regions overlapped with the so-called "default network," which activates during rest and deactivates with attention-demanding activities. Partial correlations controlling for nicotine plasma levels indicated associations of deactivation by nicotine in posterior cingulate and angular gyrus with performance improvements under INT(high). Performance and regional activity in the absence of nicotine never differed between smokers and nonsmokers, ruling out a simple reversal of a deprivation-induced state. These findings suggest that nicotine improved attentional performance by downregulating resting brain function in response to task-related cues. Together with the selectivity of effects for INT(high), this suggests a nicotine-induced potentiation of the alerting properties of external stimuli.},

    abstract = "Reductions in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals below baseline levels have been observed under several conditions as negative activation in task-activation studies or anticorrelation in resting-state experiments. Converging evidence suggests that negative BOLD signals (NBSs) can generally be explained by local reductions in neural activity. Here, we report on NBSs that accompany hemodynamic changes in regions devoid of neural tissue. The NBSs were investigated with high-resolution studies of the visual cortex (VC) at 7 T. Task-activation studies were performed to localize a task-positive area in the VC. During rest, robust negative correlation with the task-positive region was observed in focal regions near the ventricles and dispersed throughout the VC. Both positive and NBSs were dependent on behavioral condition. Comparison with high-resolution structural images showed that negatively correlated regions overlapped with larger pial and ependymal veins near sulcal and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results from multiecho fMRI showed that NBSs were consistent with increases in local blood volume. These findings confirm theoretical predictions that tie neural activity to blood volume increases, which tend to counteract positive fMRI signal changes associated with increased blood oxygenation. This effect may be more salient in high-resolution studies, in which positive and NBS may be more often spatially distinct.",

The default mode network (DMN) is a network of brain areas that is normally active during rest and involved in emotion processing and selfreferential mental activity, including introspection. We hypothesized that connectivity of the DMN might be altered in alexithymia.METHODS Twenty alexithymic and eighteen non-alexithymic healthy volunteers underwent a resting state fMRI scan. Independent component analysis was used to identify the DMN. Differences in connectivity strength were compared between groups.RESULTS Within the DMN, alexithymic participants showed lower connectivity within frontal areas of the DMN (medial frontal and medial temporal areas) as compared to non-alexithymic participants. In contrast, connectivity in the high-alexithymic participants was higher for the sensorimotor cortex, occipital areas and right lateral frontal cortex than in the low-alexithymic participants.CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a diminished connectivity within the DMN of alexithymic participants, in brain areas that may also be involved in emotional awareness and self-referential processing. On the other hand, alexithymia was associated with stronger functional connections of the DMN with brain areas involved in sensory input and control of emotion",

    abstract = "In recent years, a change in perspective in etiological models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has occurred in concordance with emerging concepts in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. These models shift the focus of the assumed pathology from regional brain abnormalities to dysfunction in distributed network organization. In the current contribution, we report findings from functional connectivity studies during resting and task states, as well as from studies on structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging, in subjects with ADHD. Although major methodological limitations in analyzing connectivity measures derived from noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging still exist, there is convergent evidence for white matter pathology and disrupted anatomical connectivity in ADHD. In addition, dysfunctional connectivity during rest and during cognitive tasks has been demonstrated. However, the causality between disturbed white matter architecture and cortical dysfunction remains to be evaluated. Both genetic and environmental factors might contribute to disruptions in interactions between different brain regions. Stimulant medication not only modulates regionally specific activation strength but also normalizes dysfunctional connectivity, pointing to a predominant network dysfunction in ADHD. By combining a longitudinal approach with a systems perspective in ADHD in the future, it might be possible to identify at which stage during development disruptions in neural networks emerge and to delineate possible new endophenotypes of ADHD",

Different numbers of clusters and different starting conditions were used. A cluster dispersion measure determined the optimal numbers of clusters. An inner product metric provided a measure of similarity between different clusters. The two cluster result found the task-negative and task-positive systems. The cluster dispersion measure was minimized with seven and eleven clusters. Each of the clusters in the seven and eleven cluster result was associated with either the task-negative or task-positive system. Applying the algorithm to find seven clusters recovered previously described resting state networks, including the default mode network, frontoparietal control network, ventral and dorsal attention networks, somatomotor, visual, and language networks. The language and ventral attention networks had significant subcortical involvement. This parcellation was consistently found in a large majority of algorithm runs under different conditions and was robust to different methods of initialization.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The clustering of resting state activity using different optimal numbers of clusters identified resting state networks comparable to previously obtained results.

We found that both thalamic systems were widely distributed, but they exhibited different patterns.

In contrast, specific connections were prevalent in the ventral and posterior part of the prefrontal and precuneus, known involved in representing externally-directed attentions.

The amount of inter- versus intra-modular connections between network nodes can be altered, or the community structure itself can be perturbed, in terms of which nodes belong to which modules (or communities). Alterations have previously been reported in modularity, which is a function of the proportion of intra-modular edges over all modules in the network. For example, we have reported that modularity is decreased in functional brain networks in schizophrenia: There are proportionally more inter-modular edges and fewer intra-modular edges. However, despite numerous and increasing studies of brain modular organization, it is not known how to test for differences in the community structure, i.e., the assignment of regional nodes to specific modules. Here, we introduce a method based on the normalized mutual information between pairs of modular networks to show that the community structure of the brain network is significantly altered in schizophrenia, using resting-state fMRI in 19 participants with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 20 healthy participants. We also develop tools to show which specific nodes (or brain regions) have significantly different modular communities between groups, a subset that includes right insular and perisylvian cortical regions.

Understanding the structural and functional connectivity of these circuits is critical for elucidating the mechanisms of the movement and neuropsychiatric disorders, and is vital for developing new therapeutic strategies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Knowledge about the connectivity of the human basal ganglia and thalamus has rapidly evolved over recent years through non-invasive imaging techniques, but has remained incomplete because of insufficient resolution and sensitivity of these techniques. Here, we present an imaging and computational protocol designed to generate a comprehensive in vivo and subject-specific, three-dimensional model of the structure and connections of the human basal ganglia. High-resolution structural and functional magnetic resonance images were acquired with a 7-Tesla magnet. Capitalizing on the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enriched contrast obtained at high-field MRI, detailed structural and connectivity representations of the human basal ganglia and thalamus were achieved. This unique combination of multiple imaging modalities enabled the in-vivo visualization of the individual human basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei, the reconstruction of seven white-matter pathways and their connectivity probability that, to date, have only been reported in animal studies, histologically, or group-averaged MRI population studies. Also described are subject-specific parcellations of the basal ganglia and thalamus into sub-territories based on their distinct connectivity patterns. These anatomical connectivity findings are supported by functional connectivity data derived from resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI). This work demonstrates new capabilities for studying basal ganglia circuitry, and opens new avenues of investigation into the movement and neuropsychiatric disorders, in individual human subjects",

To explore the heterogeneity, the functional connectivity was studied in these populations.METHODS: The present study utilized functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to investigate default mode network (DMN) in 8 healthy subjects of SA, 8 subjects of usual aging (UA), and 8 MCI patients during verbal fluency tests (VFTs). Functional connectivity (based seeds) of different groups was analyzed by using statistical test.RESULTS: Compared with SA and UA groups, MCI subjects exhibited decreased functional connectivity in the DMN regions, including the inferior parietal lobule and left angular gyrus (t = 3.53, P < 0.001). Compared with UA and MCI groups, the SA elderly exhibited increased functional connectivity in the precuneus (t = 3.53, P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that abnormalities of functional connectivity in DMN might be related with semantic memory impairment in aging. Left angular gyrus and precuneus might be the potential imaging-based biomarker for distinguishing heterogeneous process of elderly",

    abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has become a powerful tool for the study of functional networks in the brain. Even "at rest," the brain's different functional networks spontaneously fluctuate in their activity level; each network's spatial extent can therefore be mapped by finding temporal correlations between its different subregions. Current correlation-based approaches measure the average functional connectivity between regions, but this average is less meaningful for regions that are part of multiple networks; one ideally wants a network model that explicitly allows overlap, for example, allowing a region's activity pattern to reflect one network's activity some of the time, and another network's activity at other times. However, even those approaches that do allow overlap have often maximized mutual spatial independence, which may be suboptimal if distinct networks have significant overlap. In this work, we identify functionally distinct networks by virtue of their temporal independence, taking advantage of the additional temporal richness available via improvements in functional magnetic resonance imaging sampling rate. We identify multiple "temporal functional modes," including several that subdivide the default-mode network (and the regions anticorrelated with it) into several functionally distinct, spatially overlapping, networks, each with its own pattern of correlations and anticorrelations. These functionally distinct modes of spontaneous brain activity are, in general, quite different from resting-state networks previously reported, and may have greater biological interpretability},

The amount of reduction was estimated by an improved method that utilizes a first-order autoregressive fitting technique to the PCA spectrum. Analyses were performed using all sessions in order to maximize sensitivity and alleviate the problem of component identification across session. Across-session consistency was examined by three methods, all using back-reconstruction of the single-session or single-subject/session maps from the grand (5-session) maps. The gICA analysis produced 55 spatially independent maps. Obvious artifactual maps were eliminated and the remainder were grouped based upon physiological recognizability. Biologically relevant component maps were found, including sensory, motor and a 'default-mode' map. All analysis methods showed that components were remarkably consistent across session. Critically, the components with the most obvious physiological relevance were the most consistent. The consistency of these maps suggests that, at least over a period of several weeks, these networks would be useful to follow longitudinal treatment-related manipulations.",

Interestingly, recent advances in the acquisition and analysis of functional neuroimaging data have catalyzed the exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal dependency of neuronal activation patterns of anatomically separated brain regions and in the past years an increasing body of neuroimaging studies has started to explore functional connectivity by measuring the level of co-activation of resting-state fMRI time-series between brain regions. These studies have revealed interesting new findings about the functional connections of specific brain regions and local networks, as well as important new insights in the overall organization of functional communication in the brain network. Here we present an overview of these new methods and discuss how they have led to new insights in core aspects of the human brain, providing an overview of these novel imaging techniques and their implication to neuroscience. We discuss the use of spontaneous resting-state fMRI in determining functional connectivity, discuss suggested origins of these signals, how functional connections tend to be related to structural connections in the brain network and how functional brain communication may form a key role in cognitive performance. Furthermore, we will discuss the upcoming field of examining functional connectivity patterns using graph theory, focusing on the overall organization of the functional brain network. Specifically, we will discuss the value of these new functional connectivity tools in examining believed connectivity diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.",

    abstract = "Adaptive brain function is characterized by dynamic interactions within and between neuronal circuits, often occurring at the time scale of milliseconds. These complex interactions between adjacent and noncontiguous brain areas depend on a functional architecture that is maintained even in the absence of input. Functional MRI studies carried out during rest (R-fMRI) suggest that this architecture is represented in low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal that are correlated within spatially distributed networks of brain areas. These networks, collectively referred to as the brain's intrinsic functional architecture, exhibit a remarkable correspondence with patterns of task-evoked coactivation as well as maps of anatomical connectivity. Despite this striking correspondence, there is no direct evidence that this intrinsic architecture forms the scaffold that gives rise to faster processes relevant to information processing and seizure spread. Here, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution and magnitude of temporally correlated low-frequency fluctuations observed with R-fMRI during rest predict the pattern and magnitude of corticocortical evoked potentials elicited within 500 ms after single-pulse electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex with intracranial electrodes. Across individuals, this relationship was found to be independent of the specific regions and functional systems probed. Our findings bridge the immense divide between the temporal resolutions of these distinct measures of brain function and provide strong support for the idea that the low-frequency signal fluctuations observed with R-fMRI maintain and update the intrinsic architecture underlying the brain's repertoire of functional responses",

In addition, it has been shown that pathway-dependent measures of the transverse diffusivity of water in white matter correlate with related clinical measures of functional deficit in multiple sclerosis. Taken together, these methods suggest that MRI methods can be used to probe both functional connectivity and anatomic connectivity in subjects with known white matter impairment. We report the results of a study comparing anatomic connectivity of the transcallosal motor pathway, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity of the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortices (SMC), as measured with LFBFs in the resting state. High angular resolution diffusion imaging was combined with functional MRI to define the transcallosal white matter pathway connecting the bilateral primary SMC. Maps were generated from the probabilistic tracking employed and these maps were used to calculate the mean pathway diffusion measures fractional anisotropy FA, mean diffusivity MD, longitudinal diffusivity lambda(1), and transverse diffusivity lambda(2). These were compared with LFBF-based functional connectivity measures (F(c)) obtained at rest in a cohort of 11 multiple sclerosis patients and approximately 10 age- and gender-matched control subjects. The correlation between FA and F(c) for MS patients was r = -0.63, P < 0.04. The correlation between all subjects lambda(2) and F(c) was r = 0.42, P < 0.05. The correlation between all subjects lambda(2) and F(c) was r = -0.50, P < 0.02. None of the control subject correlations were significant, nor were FA, lambda(1), or MD significantly correlated with F(c) for MS patients. This constitutes the first in vivo observation of a correlation between measures of anatomic connectivity and functional connectivity using spontaneous LFBFs.",

The aim of this study was to identify effects of normal aging on the DMN using different methods of fMRI processing and evaluation. METHODS: fMRI was acquired in 17 young and 21 old healthy subjects and the data were analyzed with (a) volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course and (b) independent component analyses (ICA). In the first approach, the strength of DMN region inter-connectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients) was of primary interest, the second method provided a measure of the magnitude of DMN co-activation. RESULTS: The older subjects exhibited significantly lower DMN activity in the posterior cingulate (PCC, t-test P<.001) as well as a tendency to lower activity in all other DMN regions in comparison to the younger subjects. We found no significant effect of age on DMN inter-connectivity. CONCLUSION: Effects of normal aging such as loss of PCC co-activity could be detected by ICA, but not by signal time course correlation analyses of DMN inter-connectivity. This either indicates lower sensitivity of inter-connectivity measures to detect subtle DMN changes or indicate that ICA and time course analyses determine different properties of DMN co-activation. Our results, therefore, provide fundamental knowledge for a potential future use of functional MRI as biomarker for neurodegenerative dementias where diminished DMN activity needs to be reliably differentiated from that observed in health aging.",

Several statistical parameters, such as degree (D), clustering coefficient (C) and shortest absolute path length (L), were included to test whether or not there was significant correlation between these parameters and the duration of heroin use. Our results demonstrated abnormal topological properties in several brain regions among our heroin-dependent subjects. Some of these regions are key areas of drug addiction-related circuits (control, reward, motivation/drive and memory), while others are involved in stress regulation. In addition, the duration of heroin use was positively correlated with the parameter D in the right parahippocampal gyrus, left putamen and bilateral cerebellum, but negatively correlated with the parameter L in the same regions. Our findings suggested that there is abnormal functional organization in heroin-dependent individuals and that the duration of heroin use is a critical factor leading to the altered brain connectivity.",

In this study, we used fMRI to examine age differences in the neural underpinnings of attentional control and their relationship to differences in distractibility and subsequent memory for distraction. Older and younger adults were shown a rapid stream of words or nonwords superimposed on objects and performed a 1-back task on either the letters or the objects, while ignoring the other modality. Older adults were more distracted than younger adults by the overlapping words during the 1-back task, and they subsequently showed more priming for these words on an implicit memory task. A multivariate analysis of the imaging data revealed a set of regions, including the rostral PFC and inferior parietal cortex, that younger adults activated to a greater extent than older adults during the ignore-words condition, and activity in this set of regions was negatively correlated with priming for the distracting words. Functional connectivity analyses using right and left rostral PFC seeds revealed a network of putative control regions, including bilateral parietal cortex, connected to the frontal seeds at rest. Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity within this frontoparietal network, suggesting that their greater distractibility may be due to decreased activity and coherence within a cognitive control network that normally acts to reduce interference from distraction",

    abstract = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a major technique for studying cognitive function and its disruption in mental illness, including schizophrenia. The major proportion of imaging studies focused primarily upon identifying regions which hemodynamic response amplitudes covary with particular stimuli and differentiate between patient and control groups. In addition to such amplitude based comparisons, one can estimate temporal correlations and compute maps of functional connectivity between regions which include the variance associated with event-related responses as well as intrinsic fluctuations of hemodynamic activity. Functional connectivity maps can be computed by correlating all voxels with a seed region when a spatial prior is available. An alternative are multivariate decompositions such as independent component analysis (ICA) which extract multiple components, each of which is a spatially distinct map of voxels with a common time course. Recent work has shown that these networks are pervasive in relaxed resting and during task performance and hence provide robust measures of intact and disturbed brain activity. This in turn bears the prospect of yielding biomarkers for schizophrenia, which can be described both in terms of disrupted local processing as well as altered global connectivity between large-scale networks. In this review we will summarize functional connectivity measures with a focus upon work with ICA and discuss the meaning of intrinsic fluctuations. In addition, examples of how brain networks have been used for classification of disease will be shown. We present work with functional network connectivity, an approach that enables the evaluation of the interplay between multiple networks and how they are affected in disease. We conclude by discussing new variants of ICA for extracting maximally group discriminative networks from data. In summary, it is clear that identification of brain networks and their inter-relationships with fMRI has great potential to improve our understanding of schizophrenia",

In addition, the structure-function correlation studied using diffuse tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI is briefly discussed. Second, I have discussed the reservations and potential pitfalls of 2 major imaging methods: voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and task fMRI. Problems encountered with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping can be overcome by using resting-state fMRI and evaluating undamaged brain networks in patients. Regarding task fMRI in patients, I have also emphasized the importance of evaluating the baseline brain activity because the amplitude of activation in BOLD fMRI is hard to interpret as the same baseline cannot be assumed for both patient and normal groups",

    title = "{Effects of different correlation metrics and preprocessing factors on small-world brain functional networks: a resting-state functional MRI study.}",
    abstract = {Graph theoretical analysis of brain networks based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. These analyses often involve the selection of correlation metrics and specific preprocessing steps. However, the influence of these factors on the topological properties of functional brain networks has not been systematically examined. Here, we investigated the influences of correlation metric choice (Pearson's correlation versus partial correlation), global signal presence (regressed or not) and frequency band selection [slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) versus slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz)] on the topological properties of both binary and weighted brain networks derived from them, and we employed test-retest (TRT) analyses for further guidance on how to choose the "best" network modeling strategy from the reliability perspective. Our results show significant differences in global network metrics associated with both correlation metrics and global signals. Analysis of nodal degree revealed differing hub distributions for brain networks derived from Pearson's correlation versus partial correlation. TRT analysis revealed that the reliability of both global and local topological properties are modulated by correlation metrics and the global signal, with the highest reliability observed for Pearson's-correlation-based brain networks without global signal removal (WOGR-PEAR). The nodal reliability exhibited a spatially heterogeneous distribution wherein regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability in Pearson's-correlation-based brain networks. Moreover, we found that there were significant frequency-related differences in topological properties of WOGR-PEAR networks, and brain networks derived in the 0.027-0.073 Hz band exhibited greater reliability than those in the 0.01-0.027 Hz band. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence regarding the influences of correlation metrics and specific preprocessing choices on both the global and nodal topological properties of functional brain networks. This study also has important implications for how to choose reliable analytical schemes in brain network studies},

    abstract = "Abnormalities of functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) recently have been reported in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other psychiatric diseases. As such, these abnormalities may be epiphenomena instead of playing a causal role in AD progression. To date, few studies have investigated specific brain networks, which extend beyond DMN involved in the early AD stages, especially in aMCI. The insula is one site affected by early pathological changes in AD and is a crucial hub of the human brain networks. Currently, we explored the contribution of the insula networks to cognitive performance in aMCI patients. Thirty aMCI and 26 cognitively normal (CN) subjects participated in this study. Intrinsic connectivity of the insula networks was measured, using the resting-state functional connectivity fMRI approach. We examined the differential connectivity of insula networks between groups, and the neural correlation between the altered insula networks connectivity and the cognitive performance in aMCI patients and CN subjects, respectively. Insula subregional volumes were also investigated. AMCI subjects, when compared to CN subjects, showed significantly reduced right posterior insula volumes, cognitive deficits and disrupted intrinsic connectivity of the insula networks. Specifically, decreased intrinsic connectivity was primarily located in the frontal-parietal network and the cingulo-opercular network, including the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, operculum, inferior parietal cortex and precuneus. Increased intrinsic connectivity was primarily situated in the visual-auditory pathway, which included the posterior superior temporal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus. Conjunction analysis was performed; and significantly decreased intrinsic connectivity in the overlapping regions of the anterior and posterior insula networks, including the bilateral aPFC, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and anterior temporal pole was found. Furthermore, the disrupted intrinsic connectivity was associated with episodic memory (EM) deficits in the aMCI patients and not in the CN subjects. These findings demonstrated that the functional integration of the insula networks plays an important role in the EM process. They provided new insight into the neural mechanism underlying the memory deficits in aMCI patients",

Here, we examine the possibility that sex-related differences in amygdala involvement in memory for emotional material develop from differential patterns of amygdala functional connectivity evident in the resting brain. Seed voxel partial least square analyses of regional cerebral blood flow data revealed significant sex-related differences in amygdala functional connectivity during resting conditions. The right amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in men than in women. In contrast, the left amygdala was associated with greater functional connectivity in women than in men. Furthermore, the regions displaying stronger functional connectivity with the right amygdala in males (sensorimotor cortex, striatum, pulvinar) differed from those displaying stronger functional connectivity with the left amygdala in females (subgenual cortex, hypothalamus). These differences in functional connectivity at rest may link to sex-related differences in medical and psychiatric disorders",

    abstract = "Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks. Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing.",

    title = "{Enhanced resting-state connectivity of amygdala in the immediate aftermath of acute psychological stress.}",
    abstract = "Recent neuroimaging studies investigating responses to stressful stimuli may importantly further our understanding of psychological trauma etiology. However, theory posits that sustained activation of these stress circuits after the stressful event may play an equally important role in the development of stress-related psychopathology. Importantly, such post-stress network changes remain poorly characterized. The amygdala with its connections is crucially positioned in the central stress circuitry that mediates the initial stress response. Hence, we investigated post-stress amygdala-centered connectivity patterns in order to characterize the aftermath of acute, experimentally-induced stress in healthy humans. We recorded resting-state functional MRI in 26 female participants following a period of moderate psychological stress induced by means of aversive (vs. emotionally neutral) movie watching with a self-referencing instruction. Next, we implemented a seedregion analysis calculating the voxel-wise correlation with the anatomically extracted time-series of the amygdala. Various stress measures confirmed successful stress induction. Moreover, we demonstrated enhanced functional coupling of the amygdala with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and a dorso-rostral pontine region, which appears to overlap with the anatomical location of the locus coeruleus (LC), when contrasting the stress with the control group. Thus, we show that the aftermath of acute stress is qualified by prolonged activation in an amygdala-connectivity network. This pattern of co-activation may indicate an extended state of hypervigilance that promotes sustained salience and mnemonic processing after stress. Characterization of the post-stress brain state may provide initial insight into the early phases of psychological trauma formation.",

    abstract = "Diagnosis of patients with a disorder of consciousness is very challenging. Previous studies investigating resting state networks demonstrate that 2 main features of the so-called default mode network (DMN), metabolism and functional connectivity, are impaired in patients with a disorder of consciousness. However, task-induced deactivation - a third main feature of the DMN - has not been explored in a group of patients. Deactivation of the DMN is supposed to reflect interruptions of introspective processes. Seventeen patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, former vegetative state), 8 patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), and 25 healthy controls were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a passive sentence listening task. Results show that deactivation in medial regions is reduced in MCS and absent in UWS patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, behavioral scores assessing the level of consciousness correlate with deactivation in patients. On single-subject level, all control subjects but only 2 patients in MCS and 6 with UWS exposed deactivation. Interestingly, all patients who deactivated during speech processing (except for one) showed activation in left frontal regions which are associated with conscious processing. Our results indicate that deactivation of the DMN can be associated with the level of consciousness by selecting those who are able to interrupt ongoing introspective processes. In consequence, deactivation of the DMN may function as a marker of consciousness.",

For this reason, data-driven resting-state fMRI methods are promising for pharmacological research. This study aimed to investigate whether different psychoactive substances cause drug-specific effects in functional brain connectivity during resting-state. In this double blind placebo-controlled (double dummy) crossover study, seven resting-state fMRI scans were obtained in 12 healthy young men in three different drug sessions (placebo, morphine and alcohol; randomized). Drugs were administered intravenously based on validated pharmacokinetic protocols to minimize the inter- and intra-subject variance in plasma drug concentrations. Dual-regression was used to estimate whole-brain resting-state connectivity in relation to eight well-characterized resting-state networks, for each data set. A mixed effects analysis of drug by time interactions revealed dissociable changes in both pharmacodynamics and functional connectivity resulting from alcohol and morphine. Post hoc analysis of regions of interest revealed adaptive network interactions in relation to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic curves.

    abstract = "Examining the spontaneous activity to understand the neural mechanism of brain disorder is a focus in recent resting-state fMRI. In the current study, to investigate the alteration of brain functional connectivity in partial epilepsy in a systematical way, two levels of analyses (functional connectivity analysis within resting state networks (RSNs) and functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis) were carried out on resting-state fMRI data acquired from the 30 participants including 14 healthy controls(HC) and 16 partial epilepsy patients. According to the etiology, all patients are subdivided into temporal lobe epilepsy group (TLE, included 7 patients) and mixed partial epilepsy group (MPE, 9 patients). Using group independent component analysis, eight RSNs were identified, and selected to evaluate functional connectivity and FNC between groups. Compared with the controls, decreased functional connectivity within all RSNs was found in both TLE and MPE. However, dissociating patterns were observed within the 8 RSNs between two patient groups, i.e, compared with TLE, we found decreased functional connectivity in 5 RSNs increased functional connectivity in 1 RSN, and no difference in the other 2 RSNs in MPE. Furthermore, the hierarchical disconnections of FNC was found in two patient groups, in which the intra-system connections were preserved for all three subsystems while the lost connections were confined to intersystem connections in patients with partial epilepsy. These findings may suggest that decreased resting state functional connectivity and disconnection of FNC are two remarkable characteristics of partial epilepsy. The selective impairment of FNC implicated that it is unsuitable to understand the partial epilepsy only from global or local perspective. We presumed that studying epilepsy in the multi-perspective based on RSNs may be a valuable means to assess the functional changes corresponding to specific RSN and may contribute to the understanding of the neuro-pathophysiological mechanism of epilepsy",

    abstract = "Cognitive skills undergo protracted developmental changes resulting in proficiencies that are a hallmark of human cognition. One skill that develops over time is the ability to problem solve, which in turn relies on cognitive control and attention abilities. Here we use a novel multimodal neurocognitive network-based approach combining task-related fMRI, resting-state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the maturation of control processes underlying problem solving skills in 7-9 year-old children. Our analysis focused on two key neurocognitive networks implicated in a wide range of cognitive tasks including control: the insula-cingulate salience network, anchored in anterior insula (AI), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, and the fronto-parietal central executive network, anchored in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We found that, by age 9, the AI node of the salience network is a major causal hub initiating control signals during problem solving. Critically, despite stronger AI activation, the strength of causal regulatory influences from AI to the PPC node of the central executive network was significantly weaker and contributed to lower levels of behavioral performance in children compared to adults. These results were validated using two different analytic methods for estimating causal interactions in fMRI data. In parallel, DTI-based tractography revealed weaker AI-PPC structural connectivity in children. Our findings point to a crucial role of AI connectivity, and its causal cross-network influences, in the maturation of dynamic top-down control signals underlying cognitive development. Overall, our study demonstrates how a unified neurocognitive network model when combined with multimodal imaging enhances our ability to generalize beyond individual task-activated foci and provides a common framework for elucidating key features of brain and cognitive development. The quantitative approach developed is likely to be useful in investigating neurodevelopmental disorders, in which control processes are impaired, such as autism and ADHD",
