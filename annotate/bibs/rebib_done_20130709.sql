An important question is whether this functional organization emerges only in response to external attentional demands or is represented more fundamentally in the internal dynamics of brain activity. To address this question, we examine correlations in spontaneous fluctuations of the functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent signal in the absence of task, stimuli, or explicit attentional demands. We identify a bilateral dorsal attention system and a right-lateralized ventral attention system solely on the basis of spontaneous activity. Further, we observe regions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with both systems, a potential mechanism for mediating the functional interaction between systems. These findings demonstrate that the neuroanatomical substrates of human attention persist in the absence of external events, reflected in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity.","Department of Radiology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA. foxm(at)npg.wustl.edu","","0027-8424","Proc.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported increased bilateral activation during task performance in elderly participants compared to their younger counterparts, particularly in frontal regions. Alterations have also been observed in the functional architecture of the resting brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in the organization of the networks of the brain. However, previous studies have largely focused on the default mode network, and little is known about the effects of age on other resting state-networks (RSNs). The aim of the present study was to investigate age-differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI data obtained during rest from 238 healthy participants aged 21-80 years. Using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual-regression, the results revealed age-related increases in RSFC across a range of RSNs, including task-positive networks in frontal and parietal regions. In contrast, age-related reductions in the default mode network and occipital visual networks were observed. Furthermore, whereas the effects of age on the various RSNs were found independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume, sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and widespread effects of estimated subject motion on the RSFC across RSNs. The results provide support for the notion of network-specific effects in aging, manifested as increased tonic activation of task-positive networks, supporting higher-order cognitive functions and cognitive control, along with reduced task-negative default mode network and sensory visual networks during rest. The present results also corroborate recent evidence of strong influence of subject motion on estimated functional connectivity measures and strongly suggest that studies using RSFC measures as imaging phenotypes should adjust for individual differences in in-scanner subject motion.","Centre for the Study of Human Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway.","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.004","1095-9572","Neuroimage","Adult and Age Factors and Aged and Aged, 80 and over and Aging and Artifacts and Brain and Brain Mapping and Female and Humans and Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Male and Middle Aged and Motion and Neural Pathways and Rest and Young Adult","independent_component_analysis");

Using fMRI, we examined the impact of hippocampal damage on the engagement and connectivity of the AM network in 11 patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy (mean age of onset of seizures, 24 years) with significant left hippocampal atrophy and a mild AM deficit. All investigations were completed pre-surgically. The fMRI paradigm comprised three conditions: (i) retrieving specific AMs in response to personalized cues obtained during a pre-scan interview; (ii) a sentence completion control task; and (iii) a size discrimination control task. AM-related activity (relative to the control tasks) was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls, in residual hippocampal tissue and across the AM network, including the medial prefrontal cortex, temporal poles, retrosplenial and lateral parietal cortex. Furthermore, the strength of connections involving the left HC was also reduced in patients. In contrast, connections between extra-hippocampal nodes, such as left retrosplenial and medial prefrontal cortex, were strengthened in patients, possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism. Our findings confirm that the left HC is a crucial node in the AM network, possibly playing a dominant role in initiating the engagement of other network nodes, and its damage has significant consequences for the functional organization and connectivity of the neural network supporting AM retrieval.","Toronto Western Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.","","1460-2156","Brain","Adult and Atrophy and Brain and Brain Mapping and Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe and Female and Hippocampus and Humans and Intelligence and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Male and Memory Disorders and Mental Recall and Middle Aged and Neural Pathways and Neuropsychological Tests","");

In this paper, we report fMRI findings showing that segregated cortical regions along the STS are involved in distinct aspects of voice processing and that they functionally cooperate during speaker recognition. Subjects listened to identical sets of auditory sentences while recognizing either a target sentence irrespective of the speaking voice or a target voice irrespective of the sentence meaning. As the same stimulus material was used in both conditions, task-related activations were not confounded by differences in speech acoustic features. Half of the stimuli were voices of familiar persons and half of persons that were never encountered before. Recognizing voices activated the right anterior and posterior STS more than recognizing verbal content. While the right anterior STS responded equally to both voice categories, the right posterior STS displayed stronger responses to non-familiar than to familiar speakers' voices. It also responded to our baseline condition of amplitude modulated noises that required a detailed analysis of complex temporal patterns. Analyses of connectivity (psychophysiological interactions) revealed that during speaker recognition both anterior and posterior right STS interacted with a region in the mid/anterior part of the right STS, a region that has been implicated in processing the acoustic properties of voices. Moreover, the anterior and posterior STS displayed distinct connectivity patterns depending on familiarity. Our results thus distinguish three STS regions that process different properties of voices and interact in a specific manner depending on familiarity with the speaker.","Cognitive Neurology Unit, Department of Neurology, J.W.

The presence of circuits that involve prefrontal regions confirms that the cerebellum participates in networks important to cognition including a specific fronto-cerebellar circuit that interacts with the default network.

Color-word congruent and incongruent conditions were presented in six AB trials to healthy subjects during 12 H2(15)O PET scans. Analyses identified two reproducible canonical eigenimages (CE) from the PET data, which were converted to a standard Z score scale after cross-validation resampling and correction for random subject effects. The first CE corresponded to practice-dependent changes in covarying rCBF that occurred over early task repetitions and correlated with improved behavioral performance. This included many regions previously implicated by PET and fMRI studies of this task, which we suggest may represent two 'parallel' networks: (i) a cingulo-frontal system that was initially engaged in selecting and mapping a task-relevant response (color naming) when the attentional demands of the task were greatest; and (ii) a ventral visual processing stream whose concurrent decrease in activity represented the task-irrelevant inhibition of word reading. The second CE corresponded to a consistent paradigmatic effect of Stroop interference on covarying rCBF. Coactivations were located in dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions as well as frontopolar cortex. This pattern supports existing evidence that prefrontal regions are involved in maintaining attentional control over conflicting response systems. Taken together, these findings may be more in line with theoretical models that emphasize a role for practice in the emergence of Stroop phenomena.

To complement this parameterized approach, here, we employed a data-driven method--independent component analysis (ICA)--to elucidate neural networks and the relationship between neural networks subserving cognitive control. In 59 adults performing the SST during fMRI, we characterized six independent components with ICA. These functional networks, temporally sorted for go success, SS, and SE trials as the events of interest, included a motor cortical network for motor preparation and execution; a right fronto-parietal network for attentional monitoring; a left fronto-parietal network for response inhibition; a midline cortico-subcortical network for error processing; a cuneus-precuneus network for behavioral engagement; and a 'default' network for self-referential processing.

Given that altered hippocampal function and structure has been found in adults who carry the methionine (met) allele of the BDNF gene and the molecular studies elucidating the role of BDNF in neurogenesis and synapse formation, we examined the association between BDNF gene variants and neural resting connectivity in children and adolescents. We observed a reduction in hippocampal and parahippocampal to cortical connectivity in met-allele carriers within both default-mode and executive networks. In contrast, we observed increased connectivity to amygdala, insula and striatal regions in met-carriers, within the paralimbic network. Because of the known association between the BDNF gene and neuropsychiatric disorder, this latter finding of greater connectivity in circuits important for emotion processing may indicate a new neural mechanism through which these gene-related psychiatric differences are manifest. Here we show that the BDNF gene, known to regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity in the brain, affects functional connectivity at the neural systems level.

Contrasts across conditions in which cognitive load is parametrically modulated can delineate neural structures that have decreases in activation in response to high-demand task conditions. Examination of the degree to which these networks subsume dissociable brain substrates, and of the degree to which they overlap, provides insight concerning their purpose, function, and the nature of their associations. Few studies have examined the DMN in children, and none have tested whether the neural regions that comprise the DMN during a resting condition are the same regions that show reduced activity when children engage in cognitive tasks. In this paper we describe regions that show both task-related decreases and spontaneous intrinsic activity at rest in children, and we examine the co-localization of these networks. We describe ways in which the DMN in 7-12-year-old children is both similar to and different from the DMN in adults; moreover, we document that task-induced deactivations and default-mode resting-state activity in children share common neural substrates. It appears, therefore, that even before adolescence a core aspect of task-induced deactivation involves reallocating processing resources that are active at rest.
